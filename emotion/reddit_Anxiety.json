Then college came around and I had one of the worst and most stressful semesters I've ever had, so that made the anxiety even worse. Luckily I ended up finding out why I had tinnitus, I was diagnosed with a neurological disorder called visual snow syndrome which caused the tinnitus, and it also gives me some floaters and static in my vision.

It started with random abdominal pain and bad stomach issues like constipation, etc at least one or 2 weeks per month, and I never used to have problems like this. I have constant sinus pressure all around my nose and by my eyes. Things just keeps getting worse.

I asked the creator of the tweet and they said this clinic was taking anyone, regardless of where you\u2019re from. This clinic was over a 45 minute drive away from me, but I figured this was going to be the only way I could get vaccinated within the near future. I drove all the way there and saw that the tweet had gone viral and the line was growing now - which was a good thing since they had so many doses to use.

And that post blew my mind because I had the exact same symptoms as he had! \n\nI cried on that very day because I finally got an actual answer not some answer that is sketchy or untrue. And my crying actually gave me hope and caused my memory to return to normal for atleast 2 whole days! \n\nNow we are at the present day, I am going to talk with my Doctor about my disorder to see what options in terms of recovery are, but I am going to start Group Therapy and one on one therapy in the upcoming months. I am also trying to sleep more, eat more healthy and exercise more.  I also had a great support talk system during those 8 months with my teachers. \n\nI am Hopeful that not only this will go away but that this will make me even stronger than I was before. \n\nThank you for reading my story and thank you Reddit for being the one to answer.", "title": "Hopeful That GAD Will Go Away"}, {"created_utc": 1632349123, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/pth6pz/has_anyone_here_been_succesful_with_ashwaganda/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Has anyone here been succesful with Ashwaganda?"}, {"created_utc": 1632348721, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/pth1st/who_else_struggles_with_overthinking/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "I go through different phases where i\u2019m either severe anxious state more than normal, or sometimes a depressive state, or having more ocd tendencies than usual but all the sudden, I cannot stop overthinking.

Receiving responses from strangers outside looking in would also help me see it for what it is and think more rationally. I will try my best to express how I feel in words and describe my current life situation. This is one of the things actually, that has really affected me in the past few months - that I struggle to communicate, talk, socialise, I give short responses when I talk to people as my mind goes blank, I don\u2019t know what else to say, it gives off the idea that I don\u2019t care about what they\u2019re speaking about and I don\u2019t like that, because I really do take in and listen to everything people say to me. It has caused people around me to say things like \u201cit\u2019s like speaking to a brick wall\u201d, \u201cis that it?\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re so hard to talk to\u201d, and that really affects me and I want to change and communicate more naturally, where things just naturally come to mind and I speak more. Also, my memory has gotten worse lately. It\u2019s like I\u2019m frustrated with my own mind. I think less logically and I\u2019m fully aware of that. I\u2019m also a very sensitive person, the littlest things will upset me and I struggle to control my emotions, I want to have \u2018thicker skin\u2019, I feel weak. These things affect my relationships with the people around me. \n\n(I have had social anxiety in recent years as a teen, I have worked on that but it seems like it\u2019s back in control over me now)\n\nOn to my life situation now, I recently got my first ever job back in august (Beginning of august). It\u2019s a part time retail job, only working a few hours a week. I got this job to gain two things: money to save and work experience. During my job interview, I told them I can work anytime of the week, fully flexible. Once I got the job, i found that they only give you your shift schedule for just the week ahead. They could give you next weeks schedule on the Sunday and you would only then find out you\u2019re working on the next Monday. This means I can\u2019t plan anything else in my life ahead of time, I can\u2019t book an appointment, I can\u2019t plan personal things like driving lessons ahead of time, I can\u2019t tell my friends yes I\u2019ll be free that day. \n\nI have exams next month. This means I can\u2019t work on specific days. A week ago, I told my manager I can\u2019t do a shift this week but I can do that shift any other time during that week. I received a taunting response that involved sarcastic questions involving me saying at the beginning that I could work anytime. I later apologised and responded that I can do the shift. They ignored two of my last messages. \n\nFast forward to today.  I have been scared to tell them about my exams as it\u2019s multiple days during next month that I can\u2019t do. I send an apologetic message to a different manager, which explained my situation and also told them I can still work plenty of hours the whole time, just at specific times and days. Also added I can work more after to make up for the inconvenience. No response the whole day. \n\nI have a shift in two days. I am scared to go to work. But if they don\u2019t compromise and allow me to sit my exams, I am going to have no choice but to quit. Even if I realistically could still work as usual, just not anytime. Because after all, I think everyone can agree on Education &gt; some part time temporary retail job. Education is what will allow me to achieve my goals and have a good career in life. That\u2019s my top priority. \n\nLately, I feel so stressed, so restless, so anxious, I\u2019m losing sleep, I\u2019m losing my appetite. It\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly having a mild anxiety attack. I\u2019m overthinking all the time. Ive lost touch of feeling relaxed. I don\u2019t feel happy about myself. I\u2019m not happy with how I am as a person. I want to change my whole mindset but I don\u2019t know where to start.\n\nAnd to add on to that, I feel like due to my personal social issues, I am gradually losing the person I\u2019m in love with. I want to be outgoing and talkative. It would majorly benefit me. I feel like they\u2019re slowly slipping away and I don\u2019t want to lose them. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read my whole post, thank you.

He moved to another state when i was 9. So i started going to visit him every summer and winter break. But it\u2019s not just him but also my ex stepmom and step sister. Ive never enjoyed going over there. I just was anxious and sad most of the time, and wanted to go back with my mom. Being with her doesn\u2019t make my anxiety and depression go away but she doesn\u2019t FUEL it ya know. The way my dad and ex step mom did things it just made me uncomfortable and feel nervous. I felt suffocated. And i thought that maybe it was just the step mom cus she was a bitch but even after she was gone i still just could not have a good time when i went over to my dads because he is always just adding to my anxiety. I have social anxiety and he has never been considerate of it and he always made me go places and it\u2019s hard to ever open up about anything to him. It\u2019s exhausting spending everyday wanting to die and with chest pain and feelings so overwhelmed that i start scratching the shit out of my face. It\u2019s exhausting when i leave the house fully covered in a hoodie and sunglasses even at night and he thinks it\u2019s funny that i\u2019m so anxious. I don\u2019t know how to talk to him. I thought now that i\u2019m 19 i will have more of a choice about going over to visit him, but even now he\u2019s telling me he\u2019s gonna pick me up at the end of next month and i don\u2019t want to go.

I\u2019m gay and hearing the way she can go on for hours about how lgbt are an organization and all this other hateful disgusting shit she and my family over there says i just don\u2019t like her and hearing her talk like that makes me so sad. And my dad is homophobic too and something that makes it hard to talk to him i\u2019d that he will not believe what i say or he dismisses things. If i tell him he\u2019s homophobic he will say i don\u2019t care what they do but he does. I haven\u2019t come out to him but he KNOWS how i feel about homophobia and i\u2019ve been vocal about lgbt rights and my support. He just says \u201cwell that just your grandmas opinions\u201d and he agrees with her at times.\n\nThe next situation is going to the beach with my mom\u2019s husbands family.

They are probably gonna ask me questions that old adults ask people my age. And this was supposed to be happening around the time of been visiting my dad.

Now anytime I speak with anybody, not only am I super careful what I say to not sound dumb, I think about the interaction for hours if not days after.\nI\u2019m having trouble even standing up for myself when I know someone else is in the wrong because I\u2019m so terrified of being spoken badly about. Which is so bizarre because I never used to care.\n\nI can write a novel with every little thing that gives me anxiety. I can\u2019t even post on my social media because of the fear of what others are saying or overwhelming those who follow me. It\u2019s so crazy how I am this person today, while I was the complete opposite 2 years ago. As stupid as this sounds, I truly miss being carefree and posting whatever I want it on social media. It reminds me of the times where I truly was living for me! I posted those stories for ME. Now if I post something, I\u2019ll delete it within a matter of minutes. \n\nI\u2019m not too concerned about the social media aspect, but it does remind me of a time where I was my truest self. I don\u2019t know how to get back to that place or that person, and even thinking like that gives me even more anxiety! It\u2019s just Never Ending Loop, I\u2019m dying to get out of.\n\nNot a day goes by where I don\u2019t get into bed thinking about everything that happened prior. It\u2019s gotten to the point where it\u2019s just easier to stay at home.

Two weeks later I started taking it again because I got bad headaches, a few nocturnal panic attacks which I hadn\u2019t had in a long time  (maybe withdrawals?), and then it was fine and tried to even up dosage and my anxiety just sky rocketed. Constant tight chest, breathlessness, and constantly everyday i had a physical sensation that was so bothersome. Even downing the dosage didn\u2019t help so psychiatrist told me to stop taking it.

These feelings rise to the surface when I'm in a public setting, especially in school, as I compare myself heavily to those around me. I know it isn't true, but I percieve other girls as so much more put together, confident, and secure, to a point where I can never reach their level. The thing is, whenever I return home and look at myself in the mirror, I feel pretty- and I am, according to others. It's almost like I can't point out specific things I feel insecure about when I'm in public, but I just feel an overwhelming sense of general inferiority. I know I'm attractive, but my confidence never lasts more than a few hours. Especially today, I felt extremely uncomfortable in my own skin, I felt messy, like my clothes weren't fitting right, like there was just something plain wrong about myself- all of these feelings alongside me constantly comparing myself to others lead to a small \"breakdown\", I wasn't present in the moment, too caught up in my head with anxiety.\n\nIs there any way I can find a path out of this cycle?

I wanted help and I wanted to help others too. I read a lot of posts because I want to see what we're all going through. There's a lot of trends that are worrying.\n\nIt's alarming how many of us only come for help as a last resort. It seems our anxiety not only makes us miserable but it makes it harder for us to admit that to someone. We'll then spend years hiding it, letting it fester, letting it control us. Only when we've become completely worn out do we try to find help.\n\nWe search for the secret to beating anxiety as if it's easy. For most people everything in life has been made easier by technology. Don't know the way? Use GPS. Hungry? Order food on your phone. Our minds love quick fixes. I'm realising now how anxiety isn't a quick fix. It's not just about breathing slowly when we're in the middle of a severe panic attack. Or asking how we calm down from 180bpm palpitations. It's about not letting it get to that point anymore. \n\nA lot of what makes us happy makes us unhappy. This is why anxiety will always exist and why it's so prevalent in western society. Drinking and going out until late, smoking weed, eating junk food and then falling asleep at 5am is fun. People wouldn't do it if it wasn't. But the after effects usually aren't. So often we don't want to give our vices up even when our anxiety is peaking. We just want the anxiety to go, a quick bandaid that will stop it. \n\n\"I tried exercise and it didn't work\". It doesn't work for everyone. And a lot of people don't like exercise anyway, and that's fine. But it does help the vast, vast majority of people. But if you've suffered a serious anxiety attack on Friday. And on Sunday you do a light jog around your block and it doesn't do anything for you. It's not going to make you feel better instantly. Your body will still be in fight or flight mode! That doesn't mean give up, disregard it and then go back to \"nothing helps me\".\n\nPersonally I've found some things on here people have recommended that I've tried and didn't work for me. Some I've tried and I now do daily. Others I am going to try as and when. I've seen the word toolbox been used and that's exactly it. Find the tools that work for you and add them to your pile. The more tools you find that work (even if only a little) the better equipped you are to beat anxiety.

I have no one to help me practice outside of these lessons.\n\nI feel like the nerves are part of what made me fail last time as it made it harder to focus etc. \n\nI don't know what to do to help ease this feeling, my stomach is in knots already and I still have 6 days to go. I am so close to cancelling and moving the test to a different time but I honestly think it would be the same no matter how much practice I have before it. My instructor assures me I am ready and I can generally drive fine during the lessons but when I have to drive myself I feel I just get so worked up.", "title": "driving test"}, {"created_utc": 1635503156, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/qi9q0y/spreading_pain/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "anyone else who also experienced this? from head, neck, and shoulder pain, it has now spread to my arm and back.  even to my leg. it a bothersome pain. i wonder if someone also experienced this before.", "title": "spreading pain"}, {"created_utc": 1635502776, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/qi9mrw/weird_waveblank_sensation_in_the_head_when_trying/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello,\n\nLately I've been having this weird sensation in my head when trying to fall asleep. So as I close my eyes and I'm starting to drift way in my thoughts all of a sudden I have this feeling of a 'wave' going through my head and immediately any thoughts that I was having go blank for a couple of seconds, like I'm in a vegetative state (and sometimes I feel it's going to take over my consciousness and stay like that forever). When this happens my heart starts immediately racing and there might be a jerk movement associated with it. Then it calms down, I try to fall asleep again but the same thing happens over and over again until I'm so tired that I do eventually fall asleep.  \n\n\nThis started happening maybe  a year ago or so, but it's becoming way more frequent (it's now on a daily basis).

Keep in mind that like with many other things that happen with your head it's very hard to pinpoint or describe exactly the sensation that I'm having.  \n\n\nIt's now happening with any forms of sleep (a month ago or so I used to take naps sometimes and this didn't happen).\n\nBy the way, I take Zoloft and Diazepam for anxiety and have done so for many years (a very low dosage).\n\nHas something like this happened to anyone else?

This one girl in the second row said the words \u201cdo you think he\u2019s ugly\u201d to her friend. I didn\u2019t see her say this, I only heard it. \n\nI instantly thought it was about me. I was about 3 meters from her. I\u2019m a 23 yr old male.\n\nYes I have anxiety - but the reason I thought it COULD have been directed at me was because in a previous week I also thought she was talking about me (not 100% sure tho). Another time when taking a class photo she turned her body away from mine when I was next to her in the photo (50/50 on if it had something bad to do with me).\n\nShe\u2019s not badly behaved. She\u2019s not the nasty type. \n\nThe thing is, I have OCD. I\u2019ve dwelled on the whole thing for 3 months. I have no peace. \n\nAbout a week later after I heard the \u201cdo you think he\u2019s ugly\u201d question and I\u2019d been dwelling on it I had enough\u2026. So I confronted her friend, asking if she said that and who it was about\u2026\n\nThe friend confirmed she said that\u2026. But nervously said that it was about another student. After that I confronted the girl. She said she didn\u2019t say anything at all, or said nothing about me or directed at me. She didn\u2019t seem like she was lying.\n\nBut I\u2019ve struggled to trust her. Something just feels off and I feel so hurt and offended. Not sure if I\u2019m totally overthinking this and that\u2019s why it seems fishy.\n\nI\u2019ve never been called ugly. People rate me 7/8 out of 10 looks wise. I get complimented heaps and this \u201cincident\u201d for some reason has caused me to ruminate and become depressed for so long. \n\nThat\u2019s not all. Last week I did something odd but thought it would give me peace. I printed off my best facial photos and a 1-10 scale of men\u2019s faces (rated 1 being ugly and 10 being a model). I got her to rate me using the scale. She said \u201clooking at these photos I would say you\u2019re an 8\u201d. I did this so if she DID question if I was ugly, she would see the scale and clearly see that I\u2019m not. \n\nBUT I STILL CAN\u2019T TRUST THAT THIS WHOLE TIME SHE MAY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO NOT HURT MY FEELINGS.

I took a quarter of a Xanax a few weeks ago and while it gave me decent relief I all but freaked the fuck out waiting for it too because I was scared of the onset. I\u2019m so scared to take medicine because of getting a side effect. My anxiety is so Insane right now if a pill made it worse I honestly don\u2019t know if or how I could handle it. Im not crazy. I still have my witts. I\u2019m just mentally broken because of this anxiety. I need medication. But I\u2019m scared of it. I\u2019m only 23. I have a young kid. I don\u2019t want this to be my life. I don\u2019t wanna survive I wanna actually live and be a dad. I\u2019m dead broke, can\u2019t leave the house and a mental disaster. I just want me back. I want my son to have a father.

If you have been diagnosed with an anxiety-related condition, see our page on generalised anxiety disorder.\n\n1. Take time out\nIt's impossible to think clearly when you're flooded with fear or anxiety. The first thing to do is take time out so you can physically calm down.\n\nDistract yourself from the worry for 15 minutes by walking around the block, making a cup of tea or having a bath.\n\n2. Breathe through panic\nIf you start to get a faster heartbeat or sweating palms, the best thing is not to fight it.\n\nStay where you are and simply feel the panic without trying to distract yourself. Place the palm of your hand on your stomach and breathe slowly and deeply.\n\nThe goal is to help the mind get used to coping with panic, which takes the fear of fear away.\n\nTry this breathing technique for stress\n\n3. Face your fears\nAvoiding fears only makes them scarier. Whatever your fear, if you face it, it should start to fade. If you panic one day getting into a lift, for example, it's best to get back into a lift the next day.\n\n4. Imagine the worst\nTry imagining the worst thing that can happen \u2013 perhaps it's panicking and having a heart attack. Then try to think yourself into having a heart attack. It's just not possible. The fear will run away the more you chase it.\n\n5. Look at the evidence\nIt sometimes helps to challenge fearful thoughts. For example, if you're scared of getting trapped in a lift and suffocating, ask yourself if you have ever heard of this happening to someone. Ask yourself what you would say to a friend who had a similar fear.\n\n6. Don't try to be perfect\nLife is full of stresses, yet many of us feel that our lives must be perfect. Bad days and setbacks will always happen, and it's important to remember that life is messy.\n\n7. Visualise a happy place\nTake a moment to close your eyes and imagine a place of safety and calm. It could be a picture of you walking on a beautiful beach, or snuggled up in bed with the cat next to you, or a happy memory from childhood. Let the positive feelings soothe you until you feel more relaxed.\n\n8. Talk about it\nSharing fears takes away a lot of their scariness. If you can't talk to a partner, friend or family member, call a helpline such as Breathing Space on 0800 83 85 87 or Samaritans on 116 123.\n\nYou could also try a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approach over the telephone, with a service such as NHS Living Life. If you would like to find out more about this appointment-based service, you can visit the Living Life website or phone 0800 328 9655 (Mon to Fri, 1pm to 9pm).\u200b\n\nIf your fears aren't going away, you can ask your GP for help. GPs can refer people for counselling, psychotherapy or help through an online mental health service, such as Living Life to the Full.\n\n9. Go back to basics\nLots of people turn to alcohol or drugs to self-treat anxiety, but this will only make matters worse. Simple, everyday things like a good night's sleep, a wholesome meal and a walk are often the best cures for anxiety.\n\n10. Reward yourself\nFinally, give yourself a treat. When you've made that call you've been dreading, for example, reinforce your success by treating yourself to a massage, a country walk, a meal out, a book, a DVD, or whatever little gift makes you happy.", "title": "How to cope with fears"}, {"created_utc": 1615991468, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/m71ow7/i_get_the_covid_vaccine_saturday_and_im_nervous/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Maybe I\u2019m over thinking stuff but I\u2019m 22 and healthy I\u2019m getting the shot because I have sick members in my household so they need protected.

They are overwhelming, and they have physical as well as emotional symptoms.\n\nMany people with panic attacks may have difficulty breathing, sweat profusely, tremble, and feel their hearts pounding.\n\nSome people will also experience chest pain and a feeling of detachment from reality or themselves during a panic attack, so they may think they\u2019re having a heart attack. Others have reported feeling like they are having a stroke.\n\nPanic attacks can be scary and may hit you quickly. Here are 11 strategies you can use to try to stop a panic attack when you\u2019re having one or when you feel one coming on:\n\n1. Use deep breathing\nWhile hyperventilating is a symptom of panic attacks that can increase fear, deep breathing can reduce symptoms of panic during an attack.\n\nIf you\u2019re able to control your breathing, you\u2019re less likely to experience the hyperventilating that can make other symptoms \u2014 and the panic attack itself \u2014 worse.\n\nFocus on taking deep breaths in and out through your mouth, feeling the air slowly fill your chest and belly and then slowly leave them again. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a second, and then breathe out for a count of four:\n\n\n2. Recognize that you\u2019re having a panic attack\nBy recognizing that you\u2019re having a panic attack instead of a heart attack, you can remind yourself that this is temporary, it will pass, and that you\u2019re OK.\n\nTake away the fear that you may be dying or that impending doom is looming, both symptoms of panic attacks. This can allow you to focus on other techniques to reduce your symptoms.\n\npowered by Rubicon Project\n3. Close your eyes\nSome panic attacks come from triggers that overwhelm you. If you\u2019re in a fast-paced environment with a lot of stimuli, this can feed your panic attack.\n\nTo reduce the stimuli, close your eyes during your panic attack. This can block out any extra stimuli and make it easier to focus on your breathing.\n\n\n4. Practice mindfulness\nMindfulness can help ground you in the reality of what\u2019s around you. Since panic attacks can cause a feeling of detachment or separation from reality, this can combat your panic attack as it\u2019s approaching or actually happening.\n\nFocus on the physical sensations you are familiar with, like digging your feet into the ground, or feeling the texture of your jeans on your hands. These specific sensations ground you firmly in reality and give you something objective to focus on.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nExplore new calming exercises with Calm\nManage your anxiety with the award-winning Calm app. Try a guided meditation, a sleep story, or stretches designed by experts to help you focus and relax. Start your free trial today.\n\n5. Find a focus object\nSome people find it helpful to find a single object to focus all of their attention on during a panic attack. Pick one object in clear sight and consciously note everything about it possible.\n\nFor example, you may notice how the hand on the clock jerks when it ticks, and that it\u2019s slightly lopsided. Describe the patterns, color, shapes, and size of the object to yourself. Focus all of your energy on this object, and your panic symptoms may subside.\n\n\n6. Use muscle relaxation techniques\nMuch like deep breathing, muscle relaxation techniques can help stop your panic attack in its tracks by controlling your body\u2019s response as much as possible.\n\nConsciously relax one muscle at a time, starting with something simple like the fingers in your hand, and move your way up through your body.\n\nMuscle relaxation techniques will be most effective when you\u2019ve practiced them beforehand.\n\n7. Picture your happy place\nWhat\u2019s the most relaxing place in the world that you can think of? A sunny beach with gently rolling waves? A cabin in the mountains?\n\nPicture yourself there, and try to focus on the details as much as possible. Imagine digging your toes into the warm sand, or smelling the sharp scent of pine trees.\n\nThis place should be quiet, calm, and relaxing \u2014 no streets of New York or Hong Kong, no matter how much you love the cities in real life.\n\n\n8. Engage in light exercise\nEndorphins keep the blood pumping in exactly the right away. It can help flood our body with endorphins, which can improve our mood. Because you\u2019re stressed, choose light exercise that\u2019s gentle on the body, like walking or swimming.\n\nThe exception to this is if you\u2019re hyperventilating or struggling to breathe. Do what you can to catch your breath first.\n\n9. Keep lavender on hand\nLavender is known for being soothing and stress-relieving. It can help your body relax. If you know you\u2019re prone to panic attacks, keep some lavender essential oil on hand and put some on your forearms when you experience a panic attack. Breathe in the scent.\n\nYou can also try drinking lavender or chamomile tea. Both are relaxing and soothing.\n\nLavender should not be combined with benzodiazepines. This combination can cause intense drowsiness.\n\n10. Repeat a mantra internally\nRepeating a mantra internally can be relaxing and reassuring, and it can give you something to grasp onto during a panic attack.\n\nWhether it\u2019s simply \u201cThis too shall pass,\u201d or a mantra that speaks to you personally, repeat it on loop in your head until you feel the panic attack start to subside.\n\n11. Take benzodiazepines\nBenzodiazepines may help treat panic attacks if you take one as soon as you feel an attack coming on.\n\nWhile other approaches to the treatment of panic may be preferential, the field of psychiatry has acknowledged that there is a handful of people who will neither respond fully (or at all in some cases) to the other approaches listed in above, and as such, will be dependent on pharmacological approaches to therapy.\n\nThese approaches often will include benzodiazepines, some of which carry FDA approval for the treatment of this condition, such as alprazolam (Xanax).\n\nBecause benzodiazepines are a prescription medication, you\u2019ll likely need a panic disorder diagnosis in order to have the medication on hand.\n\nThis medication can be highly addictive, and the body can adjust to it over time. It should only be used sparingly and in cases of extreme need.", "title": "Coping with panic attacks"}, {"created_utc": 1615990867, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/m71hf7/dae_have_a_more_rapid_heartbeat_as_soon_as_they/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "Whenever i wake up or hop straight outta bed after my alarm goes off, i feel like my heart is going way faster than normal. usually i think it\u2019s just because i\u2019m physically getting outta bed, but even *in* bed it\u2019ll be faster than normal. \n\ni\u2019ll even have palpitations when i wake up, or my chest area over my heart will be tight/painful if I stretch or something", "title": "DAE have a more rapid heartbeat as soon as they wake up? or palpitations?"}, {"created_utc": 1615990684, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/m71f5s/tips_to_deal_with_anxiety/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Tips to deal with anxiety."}, {"created_utc": 1615990220, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/m719g6/why_cant_i_be_like_others/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "Why can't I be like others?

My marriage came to a screeching halt, my mother succumbed to cancer, and I just fell to pieces. You don\u2019t really understand what you have in place until the foundations buckle under your feet.

I just can't stop this anxiety. It weights me down so much when I fck up again and again and fuels my anxious thoughts. I'm so embarrassed by all of my stupid mistakes that I make all the time. It makes me feel even more worthless and I worry all the time about everything already. There isn't a single day that I'm not completely stressed out about... Well my life. Most days I'm so stressed, I have a burning headache by the time I go to bed. Sometimes it stays for days non-stop. Which stresses me out even more... \n\nI know there is no reason to be stressed constantly and I already talked to my therapist about it... But none of the relaxation techniques seem to be working so I always end up coping in... bad ways. Which stresses AGAIN because it makes me feel like a failure. Is all of this a symptom of my depression?? Or is it just my personality? I wasn't always like this, it kinda \"developed\" in the last  3 years or so and got gradually worse during the last few months. By now I'm a complete fck up, I mess up appointments, I do so many things wrong (even simple things, that I've done 1000 times before), forget important stuff, mess up appointments and feel overwhelmed by everything that is going on - while beeing anxious and embarrassed about myself 24/7. I just want to chill one day and not... be. Not be stressed about my life, my future, everything. Not be anxious about going for a walk or calling a friend. I don't want to live this life, MY LIFE like this, everything sucks and I fail miserably at it. \n\nAny advice??

I don\u2019t think I am one now, because just ew. But I\u2019m terrified of turning into one\n\nSo I was having anxiety over it today and I had a compulsion. Once I read a story of a guy who looked at shota which is like anime drawings of boys who are young teens or pre teens i think and said he wished he never got into that stuff because maybe he wouldn\u2019t be a pedo then. And I got so scared that if I saw shota I would be attracted and turn into a pedophile. So I had a compulsion to look at a picture of a shota (this seems counterintuitive and it is, but that\u2019s what my compulsions are like. When I had religious ocd that god would do something bad to me I had compulsions to search up people who had bad experiences with God because my whacked brain thought somehow that would soothe my ocd which it only made it worse. I felt like I HAD to search up these experiences and read them because if I didn\u2019t idk I just had to and I hated it)\n\nLooking at it immediately it just grossed me out. It wasn\u2019t porn or anything, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stomach looking at that. It was of a boy maybe 12? I\u2019m 15, so that\u2019s a 3 year difference but still it was an anime drawing so they could\u2019ve been younger or older I don\u2019t know. I had a fear that I would find attraction to it, and though i guess a 3 year age difference wouldn\u2019t be the worst, my fear is that I\u2019ll be attracted to it and then when I age, the age I\u2019m attracted to wont age if that makes sense. Because I read stories of pedophiles where that happened to them.\n\nthey were wearing clothes but the picture was sort of in like that \u201cinnocent but sexual implications\u201d manner, that in itself made me uncomfy but my ocd kept telling me I could be attracted and so I was really focusing on my groin area to see if I felt anything/felt attracted because I was utterly terrified that I would get turned on by it and turn into a pedophile. I don\u2019t think I felt turned on, more uneasy and anxious. But this is the worst part, but I felt like I had to do it to make sure I wasn\u2019t attracted and I could stop worrying about it. I want to kill myself because of it and I just want to throw up and I can\u2019t believe I even tried it but I attempted to touch myself to see if it felt pleasurable or uncomfortable, and I felt uncomfortable. After like 3 seconds I had to stop because I just couldn\u2019t stomach it and Felt so grossed out that they looked young and it was a child and just gross. \n\nBut it\u2019s the fact that I even looked that up, the fact that I even did that I haven\u2019t been able to eat all morning because my appetite is gone and I feel like the worst person ever and that I am a pedophile. I\u2019m scared I want to kill myself and I probably will because I\u2019m to scared to live and see if I turn out to be a pedophile. I\u2019m so so sorry for even doing that and it was so wrong and I feel like puking. I hate my compulsions because I feel like I have to do them to make sure I\u2019m not what I\u2019m scared of being.

have fun, play video games, sleep late, waste time with your friends, go out to dinner, eat cheesecake, lie around in your pajamas, and do whatever else feels good to you. we'll all be dead soon, so who cares? the only possible difference between you and some health guru is 10 extra years of life--maybe--and i'd rather die at 75 than live to 85 as a vegetable in a nursing home. you'll both end up dead sooner or later, so do what feels good to you. life's too short to worry about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nis this the expected/intended outcome of Wellbutrin?\n\nmy doctor says Wellbutrin isn't good for treating panic, anxiety, or phobias. yet my dear wife seems to have experienced an almost religious or spiritual change these days. \n\nit's like something \"clicked\" in her brain, and she isn't even in therapy.\n\ni want this for myself. i need this for myself, and i'm very hesitant to try SSRIs because of all the unwanted side effects.\n\nher first 2 weeks were a wild ride--ups and downs, agitation, grimacing, poor sleep, vivid dreams, muscle tension, increased anxiety.\n\nthen around the middle of the 3rd or 4th week, it stopped pretty suddenly. she got up, she made a pile of eggs and bacon and a pot of coffee. \n\ni said \"how are you feeling today?\" and she said \"i pretty much feel fine.\" and that was that. \n\nno further side effects. it's like everything just stopped, except for the positive feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nis it possible to achieve this sort of thing myself?", "title": "Wellbutrin changed my wife into a new person."}, {"created_utc": 1615978306, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/m6xqez/anxiety_in_my_relationship/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am 19 and diagnosed with GAD.

Ngl, my mind has been working extra hours thinking about what am I going to write about and even though it is still uncertain by now, I'm sure we'll find a topic haha.\n\nAlso, before I begin with my daily bible, i wanted to say thanks to those who get the time and patience to read my first post. As i explained there, this is just a way to let myself flow and talk about my demons but it is definitely nice to get reminded that, we are not alone in this. We all have our demons and we're all trying to find our way in this world. It's comforting to know that despite what we may feel sometimes, there's nothing wrong with us and that just like everything else in life, this will pass too. \n\nFinally, as I'm sure some of you may have noticed by now, I'm not a native speaker so please forgive me for the grammar errors. But hey, talking to you will help me improve that so thanks in advance for that too. \n\nSo, the title i thought for this post is the heavy weight of existence. It sounds so dramatic but in a deep way man, isn't it heavy? Like, knowing that everything you do in life will have an effect on someone/something? It is such a big responsibility if you give it a minute and who wants to deal with it in the first place? The problem is when you realize your decisions may affect other part of the existence and now you also gotta be responsible for them, like if dealing with your own shit isn't enough. \n\nMy mind is just in a flow of constant ideas so you will have to forgive me if I don't express my point clearly or it's really vague. My point was, am i the only one who thinks our existence is sooooooo overwhelming? I am a person who tends to overthink, A LOOOOOOOT, so I try to be as aware as possible of myself which that sometimes leave me thinking: why am I breathing like this? Why do I have that on my arm? Why are my nails feeling so weird and why I wanna ripped them off? And yeah, that's when the anxiety kicks in but NVM, that wasn't my point again. What I'm trying to say is how exhausting it is to be constantly thinking of what have happened and what will be. *Greetings to all my fellow LOTR pals :)\n\nAs if it's not enough, we are all trying to be productive and responsible beings in a pointless and meaningless existence, so we keep our minds busy always, we are scrolling endlessly for hours, we watch million of hours on streaming services and platforms, seeing people dealing with their lives while we're escaping ours. The problem comes when, the battery is dead, the connection is gone and we're left alone with ourselves: what happens then? What happens when we cannot run away anymore and we're just there, dealing with our minds? I'm gonna be real honest with you, that part scares me because often leads me to some self reflection time and oh boy, I've found I'm actually worse that I think I was. \n\nWe have always been thought that happiness is everything, joy, being in love, being with friends and we are being bombed constantly with these advertisments: go, buy, travel, run, jump, dance, eat, drink that we think that's what is right. Why should we question it? I mean, those IG influencers seem to have a pretty amazing life, so why wouldn't we? The thing is, that besides it's completely abnormal that we don't question these impossible goals, we feel guilty when we cannot achieve them. If a random girl i met a few years ago is moving abroad and having the most fantastic relationship, why cannot i have that? And I'm not even talking about insecurities here, i mean it in a more deep way: is it something wrong with us that I cannot get that happiness? Will I ever be half as lucky as they are? Will I enjoy every tiny detail in life as they want us to think?\n\nThat's where it hits me, if I am lucky enough to have a shelter, to have food, to have everything that is minimum to offer me comfort, why are the demons in my head telling me i don't deserve to enjoy life? I'm gonna leave the door open cuz only we know what has bring us to this moment, a break up, a loss in all the big sense of the way, a disappointment, a failure. We all have moments in life that may hunt us for years and only we know how much they hurt. So if we all have up and downs, why does everyone keep telling me i have to be 24/7 and feel like the baddest bitch all day long? Why are emotions so deeply bury within ourselves and it's a taboo to talk about them? We all cry, we all miss, we all crave, we all get pissed off, we all hurt, we all love. Why is the happiness the only allowed emotion to show off?\n\nIdk about you but this has left me with years and years of internalized frustrations, sadness and fears I have now being able to detect. The fear of being a failure (whatever does that mean), of not being a good mom, not being a productive and responsible woman, the fear of not having a real impact in life and persons. My dad has always taught me that we have to live our life with dignity and that the biggest reward is to transcend, in every way you can. This is my goal in life. This is what I want to leave behind when I'm gone but, how can I do that when I am my biggest obstacle? When my brain tells me i won't be capable, when I open slightly the door to those fears and then I just can't. It feels like I can't. \n\nMind is so powerful and we're not even aware of it. It can destroy us if we give it the chance. I wish it could be as simple as a turn off button that we can deactivate at will, what an awesome life would that be! Luckily for us, that's not the world we live in and we have to work daily on that,  with being optimistic in this world that sees daily millions of deaths and catastrophes everywhere, knowing that doesn't matter what we all want, life isn't fair and that doesn't matter how much it hurts, it shall pass. I am no one to tell you how you should feel and even less how long should it hurt, what I mean is that we have to work on a daily basis with our demons, we need to accept them, anger is part of life, sadness to. Don't hide it and embrace them, we are a mix of emotions and as i said, they will pass too. \n\nI've learned we cannot run away forever. Those mf will always come back. In my case they came as a panic attack after I got diagnosed with Covid and even though I am aware i am not as half as damage as some people are, those fears, those unsolved losses keep hunting me and are not going anywhere. I wake up daily with a pain on my chest because I wake up in the middle of the night heavy breathing cuz my mind just don't stop. I know what's like to sabotage yourself day after day and don't let you move on. I have dealt with it or years and it's finally the moment when I say I cannot do this anymore, I'm done with pretending, I'm done with being tough always, I'm done with hiding. Years went by, partners being here, friends have passed and I can guarantee you that the only thing that remains is you. Not your parents, not your boss, just you and your existence. \n\nI know we all mean to change and trust me, I wish there was a simple recipe to heal and get yourself together but we're all different and we have to find our own healing method. For me, the acceptance of my flaws and enjoying the minimum details in life are helping to get some stability and when I'm done with my crisis, i will focus completely on what I need to. \n\nJust know that this is a path, a long one and it may be hard and exhausting. You will find obstacles in the way and you will feel like you cannot keep moving. Know that you're brave enough to focus on you, don't repress the negative feelings, they're part of who you are and just focus on presence, here and now. Feel the wind in your head, the air in your lungs, become aware of your own strength and I hope you as i am trying find the way to deal with the heavy weight of existence. \n\nSincerely yours, E.", "title": "Day 2.

It was sort of a sour sensation but not really burning. Some days was intermittent and some it was persistent.

More tests were done and no serious health issues and heart was fine. Doctor said GERD was possible.

It doesn't help that this is coinciding with a million other things going on in my life, like several family members in the hospital (with one of those critically ill and possibly on the verge of death due to his severe illness) and my house feeling like it's falling apart (broken boiler, shower caught on fire???), but I'm really worried about where my relationship is heading. What's worse is that I feel like it's all my fault and yet I'm totally incapable of putting the right steps in place to try to fix what's broken. \n\nI was initially cautious about getting in a relationship in the first place, despite the fact that I was the one who asked my SO out, for a bunch of different reasons; we're super far apart physically, I'd never been in a relationship before, I genuinely don't believe I deserve to be loved, et cetera, et cetera. From the start, I had a feeling that our relationship would be wrought with my anxiety and over-analyzing my SO's words and actions. Even if he was the perfect guy for me \u2014 and I honestly feel like he is \u2014 I get so in my head about everything that I'm convinced that our relationship is at a breaking point even though (logically speaking) it really isn't.\n\nWe've had a few minor problems as of recently \u2014 and I mean minor \u2014 and the thoughts of him secretly hating me and wanting me dead or something have just gotten even more extreme. Minor disagreements, conversations that ended abruptly because it was clear neither of us was happy, and communication issues (feeling like he ghosted me after I expressed how sad I was about all the horrible stuff happening in my life right now). No matter how much he says he loves me, I can't wrap my head around why he would practically ignore me for more than a day because things are a bit complicated at the moment in my life. I've been so crushed about this that I've barely been able to sleep and eat. *This* is why I keep everything in. If people knew how deeply sad and anxious I am, I'd have nobody at all. \n\nI just don't want him to break up with me. I really, really love my SO. Regardless of what's happened recently, he *does* understand my anxiety somewhat because of his personal experience. I just worry that it has become \"too much\" at this point \u2014 I told him about how I'm stuck in another binge-restrict cycle, not helped by the fact that I have no appetite whatsoever, and binging feels like inflating myself with a fucking air pump, and that I've become so obsessed with 'contaminating' my new cat that I've started washing my hands until they're cracked and bleeding because I don't want him to get sick (even when there's nothing on my hands whatsoever). I told him how wrung out I felt, how I've been really upset and crying constantly, and even though he's seen me sad, he's never seen me this bad. \n\nAt the beginning of our relationship, I was the closest to 'mentally healthy' I've ever been and I'm scared that gave him a false perception of how bad I feel. I do feel like I'm being torn apart on the inside with everything falling apart around me \u2014 my eating habits have gone to shit, I'm having panic attacks daily, I'm seeing 'shadows' of my cat around the house and literally chasing after them before I realize he's literally in his crate at night, and I'm crying or just emotionally numb 99.9% of the time. Am I just scared he's going to break up with me because I'm in such a state or is the state I'm in going to make him break up with me? I really would do anything to prevent a break-up from happening. Despite all the problems I've got going on, he really is an amazing person and I've learned from past experiences that I do have a tendency to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Please help me, I just want to get what I'm feeling off my chest.\n\nWhen I was little, I used to be friends with a girl called Isabella. She used to sit behind me at elementary school and we'd talk all the time, I really liked her company.\n\nI switched schools after that and, thus, stopped seeing her. At first, I totally forgot about her existence. Then, a few years later, we started talking to one another online. I was pretty depressed at the time, I had no self confidence whatsoever and felt like I was worse then everybody else.\n\nI guess my depression made me build an idealized image of Isabella. She looked divine to me, and I was deeply in love with that made up version of her. A few months went by and I found out she was in a relationship. This truly shook me and made me feel even worse. I, then, stopped talking to her.\n\nEventually, I began figuring my depression out, I was feeling a little bit better. At that time, I found out she had broken up with her boyfriend, and we started talking again. This time, however, I made sure she knew what my intentions were. We'd talk a lot and she would often flirt back, but we never really went on a date. After a while she stopped corresponding, and so did I.\n\nI was ready to move on with my life and totally forget about her. I'd hang out with other girls while we were talking, but I always had her in the back of my mind somewhere. Then, I decided to remove her from all my social media, which, I admit, kinda helped me a lot!\n\nWell, I guess life must be trying to teach me something. Out of a sudden this girl began working at the gym I go to. I was pretty shocked at first. It's been a couple weeks and I'm still figuring out a way to deal with it. As soon as she saw me, she said hi and we started talking, she even said we should hang out sometime. I'm not sure whether I want to bring her back into my life. It's always like this with her, we talk and, in the end, nothing happens and my anxiety fucks my head up.\n\nI guess I'm getting a few things out of this, though. Life is pretty random after all and we can't really control what happens to us. Furthermore, I'm realizing the idealized version of her I've mentally created is far from real! She's as normal as me, and I'm glad I've noticed it!\n\nAnyway, I know it may sound dumb to y'all, but please help me guys!\n\nSincerely,\n\nME.", "title": "An old crush of mine has been brought back into my life..."}, {"created_utc": 1629201021, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/p6276i/difficulty_starting_a_passion_advice/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "So since I got fired from my job due to my mental health I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019d give something else a try.

I have no rash and no other problems other than this. These short periods always start out the same way - first, one side of my nose will start to get that feeling, like a sunburn but with no visible redness or tenderness. Immediately following this feeling, I will be extremely fatigued and Ill usually have to lie down afterwards. After maybe three or four days, the fatigue goes away but the feeling spreads to my arms and legs. Does anyone have any idea what is going on here? Is this just a result of anxiety, and has anyone else experienced this, or is there something else going on here which I should be concerned about?\n\nExtra background info: Relatively healthy 20-year-old, 5\u201911, 230-ish lbs, no history of diabetes, strokes, neurological disease, or anemia. Maternal grandmother died of a heart attack in her late 50\u2019s, maternal grandfather died of pancreatic cancer in his mid 70\u2019s. Diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in 2012. No formal diagnosis of any specific anxiety disorder, but I do suffer from it quite often, and the aforementioned physical feeling that I get only increases my anxiety and hypochondria. I don\u2019t currently work around any hazardous chemicals, agents, or cleansers. Only history with skin problems was eczema which cleared up almost entirely around 2010 or so. No history of significant head trauma. I vape often, no cigarettes, alcohol, or non-prescription drugs. Went through a short period of about 5 or 6 months of smoking marijuana often in 2019, haven\u2019t touched it since then. Took non-prescription Vyvanse once in 2019. Never tried any other recreational drugs. Last time I drank any type of alcohol was about 4 months ago - but I do it very rarely, only on occasion. Prescription drugs include Zoloft 200mg daily for OCD and anxiety. Long history of mental illness in family - maternal grandfather dealt with unmedicated anxiety most of his life. Father committed suicide at age 42. Older brother deals with anxiety and also takes medication. I can\u2019t remember which brand, but it\u2019s some type of MAOI. I have never contemplated suicide or self-harm. \n\nPain level of sunburn feeling is, on its worst days, probably a 5/10, 10 being the most severe. Though the pain could be worse, my anxiety makes it seem so much worse than it actually is. I\u2019m afraid I have some kind of deadly disease or something.\n\nAny other information will be provided if you need it! Has anyone else experienced anything like this due to anxiety?

It COULD have just been her smacking into the empty kitty litter jugs, but it sounded like a person and the 2 people I work with are at work 3rd shift right now. I felt uneasy, knowing the basement is connected to the garage up steps, and the garage door is always unlocked because my sister can't be trusted to not lose or forget her key. I had an audio book playing at the time and paused it and didn't hear anything else. I closed the basement door and locked the upstairs side and front doors and turned the volume down and kept listening. My boyfriend calls me at his first break to tell me someone Earlier was walking up and down the alleyway 3 times looking at our house and he got the motion camera notification to his phone. Okay, super scared now. So I went down while talking to him aloud on the phone and locked the door between the basement and the bottom of the steps in the garage and told him I'm not comfortable going into the garage to lock the outer door or going outside to do it. I told him I thought I heard something earlier but it could've been the cat. He's supposed to send me the camera system login at lunch break but I'm freaking out at every creak or outside noise. I feel ridiculous because I grabbed the shotgun, stood at the top of the stairs and shouted \"I have a big gun. I heard a noise earlier, if you're hiding in the laundry room, go out the way you came in right now and I won't shoot you\" and I stood there a good 5 minutes and heard nothing. I have absolutely no realistic basis for calling the police either. My bf said it looked like the person was just coming back to check out the new grill we have on the side of the house. But 3 times? Were they looking for things to steal? Looking to break in? Looking for cameras so they can vandalize my car again? (Last weekend someone splashed purple paint over a bunch of cars on 2 neighboring streets). So many questions I have repeating over and over. Should I call the police and ask them to go through my basement and garage to clear it for me before I lock the outer doors? Should I wait to see the video myself and then decide what to do?

Really bad.\n\nI started researching who could help me and I didn't know what the term was but the person I found is a \"daily money manager\" and they deal with all types of situations. You can Google search for one near you and there's a national website for them. Most can work remotely so if you are way out in the sticks... there's a way! They are really flexible... Zoom meetings to start, emails or phone calls for the rest. Don't let distance deter you... they can help you get you crap together!\n\nDaily money managers do things such as:\n\nYou make a shit ton of money and don't have time to deal with your bills... they can do them\n\nGrandma can't do her bills very well... they can do them\n\nYou run a business and you need someone who is like an assistant but you want the legal protections... they can do this\n\nThe woman I found is about 5 miles from me, I Google stalked her and found evidence of all the things she mentioned in old internet articles, working with non-profits etc. She was very caring and my bullshit detector (which is really good) did not go off at all. I checked her licensing and everything was legit.\n\nCost for those who are curious:\n\nRoughly $1,200 to get things back to square which will take a month with taxes and other business stuff I need to get organized. After that, $85 an hour and a discount if you buy blocks of 15 hours at a time. She figures going forward I will likely need 1 hour a month after all is straightened out. It's going to be worth every dime if this removes this chunk of anxiety from my brain.\n\nThe weight of this that has been lifted I cannot describe. The whole \"money can't buy you happiness\" may be true but money is literally helping me defeat anxiety for the moment and I am okay with that. It's a lot of money to me but it needs to happen and my normal \"frugal tendencies\" get to take a back seat for a while... this is self-care that a bubble bath can't do!\n\nMy anxiety dealing with taxes and paperwork has never been about money as we won't owe and we always have extra money in a separate savings in case we were to ever fall short. We haven't so far so we just keep adding to it.\n\nAnxiety makes no sense to me, it never has and has robbed me of a lot of happiness in this life. This week I feel like it's my turn to take some happiness back.\n\nI hope this woman is what she seems to be. She wasn't fake, she shared a bit of her own struggle with anxiety and I really felt her love of what she does for people shined through. I feel like I can see a light at the end of the tunnel and although I don't believe anxiety will just vanish from my life, I now know that getting help isn't just about finding a doctor, it's about finding people who can help.\n\nMy next \"help\" is going to be finding someone who can come do some of the cleaning I never get to that needs to be done. Some of it is about time and some of it is about my health issues. My back just doesn't work like it used to.\n\nOne thing that I am thinking of, now that I am having a huge moment of clarity is this: asking for help from a business also blesses them. Most business owners want to be of help and enjoy helping those who need it. It also brings them income and personal satisfaction. Our weakness is some else's strength... and that's okay. It also brings us into community with other people we might never have met without the shortfall.\n\nMy husband is over the moon with what I have accomplished and is 100% on board and that itself lifted even more anxiety. The feelings I have long felt, that I am a failure and a burden to him were simply that -  feelings. He assured me of his love and support, gave me a huge, long hug. The mind lies. My mind tells me things that are simply not true. I need to remember this daily and should write that on my mirror. When I'm in the dumps it's the only thing I believe, all the lies.\n\nIf anything in these two posts resonated with you and you can afford the help... please reach out for help even if you can only afford it for a short while. There are people who can mow your lawn, walk your dog, get your groceries, clean your toilets... there is help and it's not always expensive. Many times a trusted friend will help if you reach out.\n\nI'll be sticking around, the waters warm here and the encouragement was just enough to keep my head above water and get me to shore.

I will do my very best to pay it forward!", "title": "Posted here the other day and wanted to update with good news"}, {"created_utc": 1626041444, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/oidril/struggling_with_anxiety_and_depression_making_me/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am almost always late for work.

Sorry long post but I appreciate you taking a look! \nI think I\u2019ve had anxiety basically my whole life and it may have been a more pervasive problem than I realized. I\u2019m trying to get a counselor currently, but I\u2019ve come here to see if some things I\u2019ve been experiencing are typical of anxiety or if it\u2019s just me. I have never been able to just easily hold a conversation with anyone except for a very seldom few people that I feel comfortable around (usually my partner at the time and maybe my mom, step mom and best friend). I\u2019ve felt stupid so many times because I can\u2019t at all explain or verbalize most of what is going on inside my head, especially in a conversation, even if I know the topic. I can\u2019t organize my thoughts and it\u2019s very very hard for me to stick to any routine. I get overwhelmed easily by clutter and then I procrastinate and everything just piles up. I immediately go to my phone when I\u2019m feeling anxious even though I know it probably makes me more anxious. I have intimacy issues, as in I don\u2019t show affection as I should and it\u2019s caused issues in my relationships. Alcohol helps socially which is why I was a drinker (I now have a child so I don\u2019t drink hardly ever but still when I do I love it). I feel like I can\u2019t connect with anyone on a deep level because I can\u2019t converse with them openly; I\u2019m very nice and seemingly a little outgoing but to me it\u2019s more of an act just because I honestly don\u2019t know how to talk to people. At work my productivity suffers so much at times and music doesn\u2019t help because it distracts me. At times even my mindfulness and Buddhist books give me anxiety and especially after having my child, I can\u2019t watch a ton of TV shows because if kids or anything gets hurt I\u2019m sad for days thinking about it (not terribly but it like gets stuck in my head like a song?). I just have too much going on in my head at once at all times and I can\u2019t finish one thing without jumping to another. My memory is also terrible, and lately I\u2019ve just been forgetting normal words completely or it takes me a bit to remember. Things like couch etc, I\u2019m like \u201cthat...thing!\u201d. Recently I tried stopping caffeine, which worked for helping me sleep and regulating my breathing more, but my concentration and productivity plummeted and my anxiety ended up getting worse to the point where I had chest pains and my heart felt like I was having a heart attack. Can anyone relate? Also has anyone tracked how their anxiety is affected by their period/hormones? I think that might have something to do with it as well.

It doesn't really affect me anymore because I can go and do most anything as long as I am consistent about leaving my house. So for summer break (I'm a college student) I decided to get a job. I work at a big box retailer in a small town and I initially enjoyed it. I've been a part time employee for two weeks but after training I have only worked in my area for five days including yesterday. \nYesterday was such a horrible day that I felt sick. I couldn't eat before and during work so I didn't eat till after 10pm. Yesterday I kept feeling like I didn't know what to do and I had no one to ask. And then I kept feeling like maybe I should have a grasp on this by now, am I am idiot, do they all think I'm the worst on the team?\nSo yesterday I go in and my manager is there so I ask her what I should be doing for the day. She tells me \"I probably have you on the sheet so go check that.\" It made me feel like a bother and an idiot that I talked to her. So I went and checked the sheet but I wasn't on it and had to go back to find her.\nI ended up stocking. But there wasn't much to stock, so I stood around for a bit like the others. And then I was trying to be a go-getter so I ask what I can do and I'm told to go stock this box of random shit up front. So I go. I can't find anything. I have no idea where anything goes. Im sweating and I just want to hide away but I do my best and go back. \nI get back and everyone is gone. I can not tell you how horrible this was. I had no idea where they went, I stand around waiting but no one comes back and so I go to another section they stock a lot and am told that they are in a different part of the store. I go back and help them.\nBut then I'm stopped and told I need to help with this other thing. The one actually thing I know how to do. But the thing is I am already flustered, and I feel like I don't know what I'm doing still. Im slower than everyone else and I feel horrible about it.\nIt's at this time that my direct boss ask me to do something later when I'm done with this. After an hour I go to do that thing but I've been given no direction, or help on something I've never done. I try my best but when I don't really know what else to do I'm really lost just standing there. \nAfter a few more hours my direct boss along with every other higher up are walking through the store and stop me to tell me to do this, I need to to do that, I should be doing this and then that. \"And if you have any questions just ask\"\nI felt horrible. I wanted to cry. It was like they threw me to the wind. I wanted to ask someone but I hadn't seen a single one of them since I'd been there. My boss hadn't come to check on me once in the 4 hours I was there until then. So I felt like I'd been thrown under the bus. \nSo I've realized that work is giving me a ton of anxiety that I don't know how to deal with. After the two weeks of constantly worrying what to do and how to do it I am feeling depressed again.

I spent the week leading up to my shot ready to go. I was feeling good until the day before, the day before I got anxiety sweats, my stomach was acting up, and I just feel generally unwell. I was scared because of all the crap that gets thrown around in the media about terrible side effects and I was convinced that I would be part of that list. I got to the community center where they were distributing the vaccines and worked up some courage outside and went in. The entire operation was set up to deal with people that are worried. I got inside and there was an easy-to-follow set up. Check-in was easy and you answer the standard questions, \"Do you feel sick? Have you traveled? Have you had contact with someone who was sick?\". After that, I filled out a sheet with my name and information and they had my right to a table to get my shot. They are very accommodating, they asked me if I'd eaten today, if I faint at needles or the sight of blood, and had hospital beds set up for anyone that needed more privacy or somewhere to lay down during the shot. They were professional and kind, they want to make sure you're comfortable with everything going on. After the shot they had me sit in a waiting area for 15 minutes. They had nurses walking around and talk to people, helping them work through any stress and anxiety that came from getting the shot. I felt safe there, they had people on hand that would help you through anything that happens. The thing that helped me the most was seeing all the other people going through the same stress as me. After 15 minutes you were free to go and get on with your day.\n\nI left proud that I got through it, I spent the day worrying about side effects but nothing really came. It's now about 24 hours after my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and I've got a sore arm and not much else. If anyone else would benefit from a continued timeline of after effects let me know because I spent a long time looking after I got home from the shot for first-hand accounts of what people experienced after their dose because the sheets they give you have every side effect possible on it and it did nothing to calm to nerves to read what COULD happen.

I was cleaning a table off and walked back up to the front where my co-workers were and one of them turned around, saw me, and then turned back to the other workers and shushed them. My immediate thought was that they were talking about me. I obviously can\u2019t confirm it, but it felt pretty obvious and really ruined the rest of my night. I spent a little bit of time in the bathroom trying to relax myself as i was getting worked up from feeling outcasted. I felt super uncomfortable and just kind kept to myself the rest of the night. I do my best to be kind to others as my older sister was severely bullied, and this moment made me feel really low. Even though they may not have been talking about me and i could be overreacting about nothing, my mind has been running rampant. I feel like I\u2019ve done good at my tasks and show up and get my stuff done, so I\u2019m not sure what would warrant them talking about me?

Let me preface this by saying I have had healthy anxiety since 18 so I\u2019m not new to anxiety, just this level of anxiety. So last Monday I quit cigarettes. The next morning I woke up for work and when I went into the kitchen for breakfast my grandma was screaming that my grandpa was dead. He was under his bed in a POOL of blood but he was alive (he hit his head and fell). I held the bed off of him for 30 minutes until the ambulance came. I was a mess. I listened to every foot step my grandma made for like 4 days afraid she would fall too and any loud sound made me jump. The 4th night was the worst I couldn\u2019t fall asleep for 2 hours because every time I would start to I would jump up in panic. Eventually my anxiety over my grandpa and grandma went away but my health anxiety was still there and worse than before. After the 4th day I decided to get my life together and reduce anxiety. I quit smoking weed which was honestly giving me anxiety anyways and I stopped eating unhealthy food which was always a stress reliever. I started taking a multivitamin and magnesium for the vibration symptoms. It was getting better but work was really fucking me up because it was a new job and I was nervous already and had to deal with angry customers all day. On Friday (like 10 days after the event w/ gpa) I quit my job because I woke up with bad anxiety and just didn\u2019t want to deal with it anymore. My question is how long will this new level of anxiety last? Should I go back to smoking cigarettes and eating junk food until this is over? Honestly I wanted to quit anyways because I\u2019m overweight but I had a bunch of blood tests at the beginning of 2020 and they were all fine except for low vitamin D. I do have high blood pressure at the beginning of my doctor visits but it goes down at the end of them.

I've never smoked in my life, never done drugs, no alcohol consumption. No known history of diseases in my family \n\nSince July my life has deteriorated a lot. It all started at the end of July. I woke up at the middle of the night (5AM) with a very strong chest pain. It lasted for around 30 minutes and I felt like I was dying. I told my mom and we went straight up to the ER. I had an EKG, Echo, and a blood test. Everything came back clear. The doctor told me that it could be the vaccine (I'm not even joking, I had the J&amp;J jab 2 weeks before the incident), but then he ruled out any pericarditis, myocarditis etc.\n\nThey told me to check my thyroid just in case and I left. Fast forward 10 days after I caught covid. I was vaccinated so the symptoms were mild. However I lost my sense of smell and taste that didn't even come back until like a month after.\n\nSo after covid, I was supposed to start an Accutane treatment for my acne. So I had to take CBC again. Everything comes back normal except my wbc that were around 10.1 and lymphocytes 48. (back in July my wbc were perfectly normal). They doctor told me it could be covid, so she said we should repeat in a month or so, to see if they're back normal. Meanwhile I was getting again sharp chest pains. The pain just comes and goes, but it's so sharp that I feel like I'm gonna faint. So I decided that I should see another cardiologist.\n\nI also developed some pain at my upper left abdomen which is also sharp that comes and goes. And I feel ramblings coming from all over my belly especially when I lay down. After a few days I get another CBC done and an ultrasound in my upper abdomen.\n\nThe ultrasound was fine, spleen, liver everything OK. My thyroid results too. They only thing that was off was my Vitamin D, ALP, and my WBC(which had now elevated again at 10.9 and my lymphocytes were sitting at 48). The internist prescribed me some vitamin D supplements and told me to retake the CBC again in a month. The sharp chest pains and the abdominal pains never went away.\n\nI also developed another thing, which feels like pulsations coming all over my body. Like I lay down and I can feel my left thigh having a rapid pulse, I can even touch it and feel the beat. This thing happens all over my body in my chest also! It's not painful. But extremely frustrating and worrisome. I haven't found a cause for it yet. I also went to visit another cardiologist, he looked at my heart and he said that I have a bicuspid aortic valve, and that I also have some arrythmias. So he prescribed me some magnesium.\n\nI was so shocked, because no doctor had ever told that I had a heart disease. This is a condition you're born with. And it can be found on an echo so I should have known about it. He said that the sharp daily heart pains are not heart related, and it's probably a nerve or something. The thing is the pain hasn't still left and it's December (it started in July).\n\nI was confused so I decided to get another opinion from a third a cardiologist, who said that my aortic valve was tricupsid and not bicuspid. He also gave me some photos from the echo to look at it.\n\nNow in November I get a CBC again (everything normal again except my wbc 12.5 this time and lymphocytes 48 (the absolute count is 5.9% when it should be like 2.0-4.0% so I'm a lot off). Now 3 months have passed since covid and my wbc are only getting raised and raised. My internist seemed worried this time so he said that I should see a hematologist/oncologist. I was so scared. Leukemia was the first thing that came in my mind.\n\nI set an appointment with the oncologist 2 weeks after the results. In the meantime, I got gastroenteritis. I had a high fever 39C for like a day. Constant diarrhea and some vomit. I set an appointment with a gastroenterologist and I told her about my abdominal pains since October. And the constant ramblings I have but she brushed it off. She said I'm too young to have something. And she just prescribed me some omeprazole for 30 days.\n\nThe gastroenteritis passed, but I still have the ramblings and the abdominal pain every day.\n\nI met with the oncologist and I told him about my situation. He told me that it could probably be a reactive lymphocytocis. And he's sure it's not blood cancer. Because I have zero of it's symptoms. (night sweats, constant fevers, swollen lymph nodes etc). He said I should retake the CBC again in December. But he also said that I should check my Igg, Iga, igm, CRP, HDL some things like that. But he emphasized on electrophoresis. He said that if electrophoresis comes back normal there's no chance I have blood cancer. He also said if I had cancer, covid would have killed me, but it was even mild for me\n\nI had the CBC 2 days ago. The results will be given to me on Tuesday. Im still waiting. I have lost my sleep from it, I suffer from insomnia. I usually don't sleep at all at night. And get my sleep from 5pm to 10pm, I feel constant ramblings in my belly, constant abdominal pain at the upper left.\n\nSharp chest pains where my heart Is that makes me faint. (I also had a 48hour Holter monitor which showed a few benign ectopic beats). I get that it could be a nerve pain, but can it be stopped? I was a great student, my grades have dropped drastically. From 90% to 30%. I can't even concentrate anymore. I'm in pain, the only thing I think about is my health. I can't live like that. I'm an 18 year old with no previous illnesses. I was totally healthy in June. What the hell is going on. It's been 4 months. I haven't had a normal day since then. My parents think I'm faking it or that it's only anxiety and stress but I don't think so. \n\n\nall 3 cardiologist said that's its not heart related and that's its probably anxiety or a benign nerve pain like the precordial catch syndrome. The thing is that's is persistent for 4 months now. \n\nThe oncologist told me to not worry about my wbc and that they're probably raised because of covid or anxiety. \n\nThe pathologist again blamed stress for my abdominal and chest pains. \n\nThe gastroenterologist also said that anxiety might trigger things like ibs that cause abdominal pain and that it could go away with time. 4 months have passed and still everything is here\nI'm sure that it could be something like cancer, like a a stomach tumor or something. If it was something simple it wouldn't be so persistent. It should probably pass, but it hasn't. I don't want to die yet, I'm young. I want my life back. Why can't I be normal again. The doctors just set me another appointments everytime I see them, 4 months have passed. I haven't even received a diagnosis yet. I just keep getting new appointments every 2 weeks.

I understand that it is my fault and don't hold it against them but it really hurt.\n\nSince then I've started to overcome the depression but it feels like my anxiety has shot through the roof. I'm so afraid both of losing more friends or of hurting other friends the way I did there. It feels like it is driving me crazy. I can't go to bed or get a shower without my chest tightening so bad and my whole body wanting to scream in fear. I've had to temporarily get rid of all social media and chatting stuff I use just to feel a little bit better. Before all this I had been trying to apply to grad school and find a job but now I'm so overwhelmed with fear that trying to do anything like that feels horribly overwhelming.\n\nI'm coming here for any advice you guys may have on what I can do to beat this.

It's been a constant roller coaster and struggle for me and this issue affects my dating life a lot.

I scare half of the guys I date away because of my closed off-ness and awkward personality (which is out of my control) and my constant need for reassurance.

He and I had banter, we had chemistry (sexual and otherwise), we had so many things in common, it felt like I finally found the one. However, I started to become clingy, my anxiety started to take over, and I absolutely ruined any chances of a relationship I had with him. He told me that even without the attachment issues, it wouldn't have worked out because Im closed off and awkward according to him and it was too much for him to handle. I told him that I'm trying my best to heal myself and I promised him that going forward it won't happen again. But he didn't listen.

I would normally talk to my sister about this, but she just finished her classes yesterday and I want to let her relax, so I'm talking to you lovely people.\n\nI just saw my mom and the rest of my family for Thanksgiving.  They live in Florida and stopped by my apartment in ATL to pick me up for our stay at a cabin in Helen.  I was so worried because I'm not the best at keeping my apartment clean - I live by myself, and while I don't have bugs or mold and I keep my sink relatively clean, my mom has OCD and will actually feel ill at the thought of, say, a buffet line or uncleaned baseboards.  She's really sensitive to smells and will bring candles with her to any hotel she stays at to cover up any other scents.  She's gone to therapy and is on medication, but as much as I love her, growing up with her was hard because the way she'd say our rooms were \"dis-gust-ing\" was very triggering.  \n\nI have a few quirks of OCD, but my main disorder is social anxiety.  Even before I went to school, I was unusually shy, and when I was bullied in school, my only redeeming trait was my good grades (and god forbid if I brought home anything less than a B to my dad).  Because of that, I have the super fun fear of failure!  Again, I'm on medication and I've gone to therapy - and I've made amazing progress! - but my mom called me this morning to let me know that she wanted to come up this Tuesday for a few days to \"teach me how to clean.\"  She says she understands that I've been busy and she admits she never sat me down to learn how to clean like she did with my sister (mostly because she's also the type of person to do it herself if it's not getting done the way she prefers), and while I appreciate this understanding, I'm still freaking out.  What mother drives up four-and-a-half hours to help their thirty-year-old child clean their house?  And it's so soon that I barely have any time to \"pre-clean\" before she gets here.\n\nI love my mom, but I have this overwhelming sense of failure, that I'm not able to live up to my mom's ridiculous standards of clean, that she came into my apartment on vacation and thought to herself \"wow, poeismyhero's apartment needs help.\"  She's going to vacuum the house before I can even pull out a spare mattress, I'm going to wake up to her scrubbing my kitchen cabinets at 6 AM, and after this, I'm going to be held to this impossible standard of clean that I know I won't be able to keep up with.  I know this is her way of showing her love, and I understand this OCD is something that she will never be able to change.  \n\nThat doesn't erase my feelings of inadequacy.  The task of deep cleaning my apartment feels so overwhelming to me that I don't even want to start the process.  I quit my job recently, and while waiting on the decision for another job, I've let my sleep schedule fall apart.  I want to sleep all day rather than fix the problems in front of me.  Maybe this visit will be good for me, but the anxiety before it is so overwhelming.  I'm going to cook a little because that tends to help and get some laundry done, but I also know I can't be the only one who deals with this.  OCD and anxiety tend to be bosom buddies, and I know some of you have OCD parents/family members.

It was in winter, and at night time. It wasn't carbon monoxide because the car was off. When he was found in the morning he was already dead from asphyxiation.\n\nThe car was off and the doors were locked. I'm not sure what model car it was, but it looked recent. I was really confused about the whole thing, so I did some researching. For a modern car with the engine off, the air is replaced in the cabin every one hundred hours or so, but with the volume in the car, one person will only survive for maybe ten hours before they fall unconscious, so the tiny amount of air coming through the seals wouldn't be enough. Older era cars were very leaky by comparison, but modern cars are designed to be as airtight as possible (there are even ways manufacturers test for air tightness) with the only worthwhile source of fresh air being the front vent. When the car is off the vents automatically seal shut. This is designed in to keep things like mice out of the vent when the car is not in use and it's a modern car thing.\n\n\u200b\n\nSome (most?) cars don't allow you to unlock the doors if it's been locked with the fob (BMW said their reason was to keep car thieves inside of the car).\n\nI can't help but wonder, would it have been panicky or would it have felt more like falling asleep? What type of thoughts would be running through his head? How long could he have been awake for in there? He was found lying down in the rear set of the car.\n\nBefore I heard of this I loved cars but now I can't look at them in the same way again because I keep remembering this. I almost feel..idk, disgust? I don't know why, there's just something really disturbing and unsettling about a comfy car turning into a sealed death trap that slowly killed someone over the course of several hours. The car wouldn't let him out nor would it let him open up the vent so he could get some air. Not carbon monoxide, cold, or heat, but...literally running out of air.

I never had big problems with anxiety before that incident.  Through therapy, I've discovered that some anxious thought patterns existed but they were never distressing or impacted me even a little.  One night while walking inside my house before bed, out of the blue, I felt an extreme tight feeling in the middle of my chest.  Went to the hospital and obviously nothing was wrong.\n\n2.5 months and a whole bunch of physical symptoms later, I don't know what I can do anymore.  Every week I think I've felt it all and it always manages to get worse.  My anxiety has a large health component around it and I'm tired of feeling like my body is progressively deteriorating every day.\n\nAs of writing this, my chest, shoulders, and back have been in pain 24/7 for weeks.  The default is tightness but any kind of pain is possible, in any location, including multiple types/locations at once.\n\nI had COVID a month ago and since then on one side the back of my throat into my neck has an irritation/soreness that varies in intensity all day.  This is accompanied by a feeling of congestion in the back of my nose and in my throat.  My throat also has these red lines on that one side.\n\nI've been dizzy for 2 weeks straight.  I can stand, sit, lie down, close my eyes or open.  Nothing makes it go away whether I feel anxious or not.  Doing something as simple as moving my eyes/head or even eating make it worse.\n\nA few days ago the dizziness became accompanied by headaches.  They move around and aren't really painful, but more a tight/heavy feeling.  I can feel it in various parts of my head when brushing certain areas of my teeth, opening/closing my mouth, or chewing food.  Sometimes my facial muscles feel weak on one side like I'm having a stroke.\n\nI read exercise makes anxiety feel better.  I used to exercise all the time 2.5 months ago until my anxiety made me scared to do it.  After getting some confidence that my heart is fine from the cardiologist through some tests, I started back up for the first time in a month.  All I do is ride a stationary bike for 10 minutes.  This makes my heart rate go crazy high (up to 190) and it stays above 100 for up to an hour after exercise.  What's worse is my chest and back tightness/pain get worse during exercise and stick around for hours afterwards.  I feel like it triggers some hypersensitivity where I feel like garbage for hours afterwards.  After that doing literally anything, like just standing up will make my heart start pounding.  Talked to a social worker who said it didn't make sense that it was worse while exercising which of course made my fears that it's something physical worse.\n\nLiterally making dinner and holding anything remotely heavy while I use tongs to grab food out of it makes me dizzy, breathless, and feel pain.  I rationalize that it's the anxiety because otherwise I wouldn't be able to last 10 minutes on the bike or walk the 6-7km I do daily that I force myself to do.\n\nI went from having good and bad days to my moods shifting every few hours.  I can feel like shit for up to days on end but can never string more than an hour or two of feeling at least decent.\n\nThis past weekend while driving for 45 minutes for the first time in my life I started thinking whether it was worth living if all I was ever going to feel all the time was pain.  I was holding back tears as I kept on having thoughts coming into my head of moving the car into the oncoming traffic lane.  I don't think I'm suicidal and I don't want to do it but it was scary having these thoughts pop into my head and not being able to do anything to stop them.  Thankfully they haven't come back since that one incident.  I'm planning on telling my psychologist tomorrow but have been holding back on telling any of my family.  I'm lucky to have people that care about me but not everyone understands anxiety and I think telling them will make them freak out.\n\nI know people with anxiety have severe physical symptoms but can it really be this bad?  Like literally having all the symptoms, all the time.  No breaks whether I'm feeling anxious or not.  Making doing anything physically uncomfortable.\n\nI have interviews for professional/grad school coming up and I finally mustered the strength to start practicing today.  I feel like I'm going to blank out or my pain is going to flare up during my interviews making me ruin all the work I've put in these past years in undergrad that got me the interviews in the first place.\n\nI'm thinking of medication but worry whether it's too early considering its only been 2.5 months of my anxiety starting and only a month of therapy.  But at the same time doing anything feels like a chore.  I literally have to force myself to do things and while I'm able to push through some times I feel like shit all the time (both mentally and physically).\n\nI've talked to my family doctor who tells me it's just anxiety and I just need to calm down or start taking antidepressants and to call him once I've made that decision.", "title": "Feel like things keep getting worse and don't know what to do anymore.

The lady shouted something at him and seemed scared. She then approached another guy waiting in front of the entrance and they talked about something. But I didn\u2019t pay attention and looked at my phone. Another few seconds later the lady ran towards me again and asked me if I was a private inspector working with that other guy whom she had talked to before. This moment I realised that she was highly psychotic and went into \u201cwork-mode\u201d (I\u2019m a social worker who used to work with mentally ill clients).

It took me months to realize that drinking was what was causing me all of my problems so I stopped. Occasionally I\u2019ll go out like I went out for the super bowl and drank but that\u2019s about it. \n\nI was never depressed, but I was definitely not happy in life. I\u2019m fine now mentally, I still have a little anxiety but who doesn\u2019t. My problem right now is that I\u2019ve fallen into such bad habits where I just can\u2019t seem to break them. I have no drive in life right now due to being forced to take a semester off from school, and being let go at my job (which was the only thing giving my life structure). I just feel so lost right now and so shitty about myself and all of my close friends and family just laugh it off. \n\nI\u2019ve had many other problem leading up to me being a complete bum but I don\u2019t want to bore you guys with a long story. Anyway I guess what I\u2019m asking is how the hell do I beat this? I\u2019m not mentally effed up anymore, I just have a shitty mindset and very lazy.

Used to always get bullied because I was always the shy, quiet kid who sat alone in class doing her own thing in subjects she struggled in and not interacting with other children as I had trouble expressing myself emotionally and socially. All I would talk about was what my special interests and just go on about it for ages because I had difficulty choosing topics to talk about and my odd speech patterns didn't help either with my social interactions. \n\nThat was when I was a child. I don't struggle with much of these things anymore after years of speech therapy and having a teaching assistant helping with the subjects I struggle in throughout the years of my education. I still have one now in University and I'm taking a course in digital creative media. She mostly helps in parts I don't understand in the subject, explains it in parts and then I get the hang of it. That's always been my mindset whenever I didn't understand something and someone explained in parts which I can understand then I'm confident. Although the anxiety of making mistakes and failing is still there.\n\nI love the course so much. I enjoy ever so much like everyone is interested in what I'm interested and they are ever so nice. I took the course because its always been my dream to become a cartoonist of my own popular adult cartoon tv show and submit it to adult swim. I love writing my own fantasy stories and I usually spend months working on them but there is one that every time I write the story and read all of it. It makes me so emotional because the characters feel and think like real people and how they handle the problems they go through based on my struggles I went through and some humour in there. The characters are also unique in their own way as well even the villains are so interesting. I've worked so hard on it for months now, I'm excited to make it into a reality eventually and I've gathered a small team of people of an artist, musician and an animator at the moment. Hopefully I can get more people in the future especially voice actors. I'm very passionate about doing this project. \n\nI thought telling my story on here would be good as despite all the things I went through. I'm still here and doing what I love.

Allow me to share a little bit of my story, please? Call it my farewell to arms in a way!\n\nI had my first mental breakdown in 2018 after a painful break up, my best friend suicide and having a bout with alcoholism which caused me to be admitted in a psychiatric hospital for the first time. After 34 days at the looney bin, I was first diagnosed with bipolar, ptsd and depression at the tender age of 23. Since that first mental breakdown, I've been admitted once again in psychiatric ward last year after I attempted suicide (it was close) and I lost control over my life ever since. I can't focus on my college classes and can't handle the simplest jobs, If it wasn't for my government giving me a very, very small pension that in a month will the turned into a invalid retirement fund I wouldn't have any income.\n\nI've been fighting a loosing war against this conditions: depression, ptsd due to sexual abuse when I was a kid, and the ups and downs. I've quit drinking and smoking weed entirely after my first admission at the hospital, I've been on all sorts of medication, I've tried every sort of psychological treatment and therapies, I even tried religious rituals (more to please my parents than for actually believing). I am just too tired of fighting, I am too tired of living day after day and having nothing to show but college debt, loneliness and scars from self harming.\n\nIs this all that I can expect from life? Poverty, misery, brutally painful flashbacks and a stigma of people thinking I am insane due to my mental illnesses, prejudice against my bisexuality and such low self esteem that I literally feel like a burden on everyone else? That doesn't sound very fair to me, but again, I don't think life is supposed to be fair, right?\n\nAll comes down to that magic bullet, the exit button that is always hunting me. Last time I tried to commit suicide I used sleeping pills, a shit tone of them, and I barely escaped, this time I have my grandpa old 38 revolver and one single round of ammunition. I am not saying I'm gonna do it, but knowing that it exists! That there's a way out, it really helps, it gives me a North, makes me feel less helpless in knowing that, for everything I can't control, I can control the way out!\n\nIt feels like I am already dead, a ghost! A husk of the man I used to be before my mental breakdown. I have no friends, no family besides a borderline afflicted mom and a pathological liar of a dad, I don't feel passion for anything anymore, I don't have ambitions of goals, I don't have anything to my name, no pride or self love left, I honestly hate myself with every fiber of my being, to the point that every waking moment is a struggle and I can only find peace after taking midazolam and falling asleep.

Well a bit of context: right at the start of july, it was about 10pm and i was vibin with my friends, just chilling, nothing too exciting or different. But suddenly my mind goes blank and i feel like my head has been filled with air. I immediately freak out and go tell my mom, i never felt anything like that and i felt i was going to just fade out of existence. My mom calmed me down eventually, but it took alot of time (until about midnight). The next days were terrible, i went to school feeling like my days were counted, and my mind simply wasnt working properly for some reason, it felt like i had somehow lost control over part of my brain. In the same week (it was monday when i had the first experience) my mom said that it was probably anxiety. I didnt know what anxiety was or felt like then, I've never had felt anything like that before, it couldn't be that terrible right? Well, the next week proved me wrong. When i woke up on monday, it felt the same as the past days, slow, grey and boring, but when the night fell, i began to feel a strange sensation, like i was going to die no matter how much i fought, and with that came many other symptoms which i can only describe as being like something or someone was pulling on my consciousness string. It costed me to fall asleep, and the following days were horrible, panic attacks every night, day time was just me scared of having another panic attack, sitting on my couch waiting for it... Then, on the weekend, i was finally convinced i had anxiety, i didnt know how to feel about it, since i was more concerned about me dying. For some reason, i have not had any panic attacks since then, but the next weeks following that event were full of doctors and medical exams. I went to a neurologist, there i explained my experience with what we thought was anxiety, and he only confirmed it, but he told me that i should do a tomography of my brain just in case. I did it and it came back all normal, absolutely nothing out of ordinary, and it kinda helped calm me down a little. Also, since the first experience, i have felt anxious all the time, i have not been able to have a single day where i can say \" man, today was a good day and i won against anxiety\". The neurologist also gave me a prescription to 25mg of sertralin, and i believe that was the reason i stopped having panic attacks... Well to finish it off i would like to apologize if this has gotten too long or confusing but its currently 6 am and i just woke up felling anxious again\ud83d\ude15\n\n\nPs: forgot to mention but im 16y with no record of anxiety prior to the events mentioned in the text", "title": "Anxiety has crippled my life completely"}, {"created_utc": 1630749354, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/phopmx/medications/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "Would be really interested to hear some experiences with anxiolytics.

Because of this, I find it extraordinarily difficult to move on from past traumas and grow as a person. Every time I leave my house I\u2019m reminded of a painful childhood memory, a past relationship, or a version of myself that I cannot stand to be reminded of. And when there aren\u2019t acutely negative memories, everything else evokes an empty poignancy that weighs heavily on my chest, which brings up unbearable feelings of loneliness.  I once had someone tell me that they felt the same way, and that this city felt like it had a ghost on every corner - a sentiment that I greatly identify with. \n\nA very common thing I\u2019ve been told/have heard is to not run from your issues, and that moving wont solve the big problems in your life, which I can absolutely understand.  I, however, feel that I have come to terms with that about myself, and my actual physical location is holding me back.  It feels as if I am in a poisonous miasma that prevents me from taking a good look at myself and being able to move on from the things in my past that I am ashamed of.\n\n So, my question here is - has anybody in this community felt similarly as I do?

We also have a verbally abusive pharmacist who \"can do no wrong\" because if he gets fired corporate will have to close our pharmacy due to having no other \"manager\" (He doesn't actually hold the title of manager) That we need to legally operate. We might have 3 techs on a good day. Usually only 2. We have a drive through and front counter so that's where we're stuck as the pharmacist tries to force one person to work both to touch the mountain of filling scripts but due to our customer count it's not feasible. We never slow down. And customers are extremely rude and not understanding. I've been cursed at, screamed at, belittled, etc. All for stuff I can't control. Best I can do is get your stuff ready now you're here. Yes I know you dropped it off yesterday but it is what it is. So now we're drowning in customer complaints all while the district manager sends emails demanding we address them, demanding we do these tasks despite you know, two people. Demanding better customer service, etc. I have panic attacks badly, but can't even step out to take a moment to calm down and breathe. Instead I just help customers with shaky hands and tears running down my face. I've applied to at least five other places to get a job, but they haven't gotten back. I'm at my wits end. My life is consumed by the anxiety of work, the dread of having to go back, I worry constantly about work. I've saved up a good bit of money, but I'm hesitant to quit and have to dip into it until I can get another job, but I don't seem to have a choice. What should I do? Should I just grit my teeth and wait it out? I woke up with the worst panic attack of my life this morning, and I just keep getting worse.", "title": "My job is tearing me apart mentally."}, {"created_utc": 1632319277, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/pt85vz/am_i_a_failure_for_quitting_my_job_suddenly/", "num_comments": 32, "score": 1, "selftext": "This is really hard for me to share because I am almost paralyzed with guilt and shame right now. \n\nI have always struggled with my mental health. I grew up in a very dysfunctional, abusive family who I still live with today. I started cutting when I was 12 and then used weed and alcohol to deal with depression and anxiety in my early 20s. I have was on antidepressants for a couple of years but I don't take them anymore. \n\nI graduated from law school in 2019. The only reason I went to law school was because my parents said it would be a good idea and I didn't know what else to do with my life. Before law school, I had changed my major many times and had failed out of nursing school. \n\nIn 2020, I couldn't find a job and was still living at home. I started using weed a lot more and experienced full blown manic psychosis. I was forcibly hospitalized 3 times (the police had to take me) before I snapped out of it. This led to my current diagnosis of bipolar disorder. \n\nI was released from the hospital at the end of 2020 and started applying to jobs. But the problem was, I became a completely different person after psychosis. My anxiety and depression increased catastrophically. I felt like I lost my personality and my soul. \n\nThe first job I got, I quit in less than 2 months because I was miserably anxious. I didn't feel too bad about it because it was an area of law that I wasn't really interested in. \n\nWhich brings me to my current situation. I was hired by a very reputable law firm about 1.5 months ago. I thought this time things would work out because it was a different area of law (personal injury). Suffice to say, I failed spectacularly. I hated the nature of the work and I became a social outcast at the office despite trying to be polite and courteous to everybody. \n\nCoworkers started gossiping about me because I was  so quiet and because my office was next to reception (where they would often talk about me) so I could sometimes hear them.\n\n Each email, phone call, and interaction overwhelmed me. I fantasized about suicide constantly, and took benzos every morning and night. I could never stop thinking about the work and always felt anxious and overwhelmed. Each day I thought about quitting but I told myself to push through for the sake of my career and  because of the student loans. \n\nBut it became unbearable and I quit 2 days ago. I made up a bullshit excuse and asked to leave as soon as possible. They told me to I could leave after I writing transition memos so we never discussed what my official last day would be. I finished all the memos in one day and left without saying goodbye to anybody because my body and mind were screaming at me to escape the place. On my last day (yesterday) I broke my years long streak and cut myself in the office. After leaving, I emailed the boss and told him I had finished the memos and would not be coming in again. I left without saying goodbye to anybody because I didn't have the courage to face them and pretend to be okay.\n\nI feel mortified about my behavior. I left in the most unprofessional way possible and I know this will hurt my reputation in my small town's legal community. I am filled with anxiety at imagining what my coworkers are saying about my abrupt departure. \n\nI also have accepted that law is not the right career for me. And so now, I am left with nothing. I am 27 and living at home. I feel like the biggest fucking failure for quitting and for how I handled the situation. I feel like things will never get better and that I am the biggest fuck-up on the planet. \n\nI guess I just wanted to vent and share my story.

I've (f26) had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but over the last five years it's gotten worse. About 6 months ago, it became absolutely brutal and I was struggling. I had a new, stressful job and was getting to the end of my rope. \n\nAbout 2 months ago, I started therapy and medication. I've only had a couple sessions with a therapist which has helped a little, but I also started an ssri, celexa. At first I wasn't sure it was working, but after about 6 weeks I started noticing changes. I haven't finished a full meal in years but now I only occasionally have leftovers. I now have 3 meals a day instead of 2 very small meals. My libido has also gone waaay up. I've had better s*x over the last 2 weeks than over the last five years. Even better, my anxiety has decreased a lot. I still have anxious episodes, but much less frequent and less severe than before. I can relax on my days off now, much less worrying about yesterday or tomorrow. It's fantastic, but it makes me sad that I missed out on so much for years because I wasn't sure I wanted to do medication or that it would help. I missed out on meals, fantastic s*x, and relaxing days off because I was stubborn. \n\nFor anyone reading this, if you are wondering if you should try therapy and medication or if you're hesitant to try, please try it.

I live on the east coast. We see each other everyday and end up staying the night together everyday for about 2 months before she leaves, so we\u2019re spending a ton of time together. She even lived with me for a week and half before she actually left. I always said I wouldn\u2019t do long distance but I thought she was worth it. The first few weeks are fine. We talk everyday, FaceTime or call before I go to bed. I go to visit her and everything is still as good as it used to be. \n\nBut then kind of out of no where her responses and our interactions change. Like she doesn\u2019t seem as excited or flirtatious with me. She always had an excuse of why she couldn\u2019t call or FaceTime before I went to bed. So I\u2019m anxious and I\u2019m like she\u2019s just busy with settling in and her demanding job. But with my anxiety and I start looking into her social media like her new followers and what not. In my mind I\u2019m like how is she getting these new guy followers from LA because she doesn\u2019t have too many friends and isn\u2019t out often I don\u2019t believe.(I know very insecure of me).\n\nI was supposed to fly to see her on Christmas Day and stay for 2 weeks. She out of no where tells me to refund my tickets bc she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good time for her and tells me she\u2019s been overwhelmed with moving to the new city and work. Then the week before Christmas she\u2019s flies into see her family. Her family is like a 3 hour drive but I tell her I\u2019m willing to drive. She says she needs to spend time with her family and doesn\u2019t allow me to see her. Honestly I just wanted any time with her. Even if it were just lunch.\n\nAfter she told me to refund the tickets I\u2019m anxious as hell and we get into an argument where she accuses me of something and I show her proof that I didn\u2019t do what she accused me of. So after we settle I text her saying I\u2019d like to talk to make sure she\u2019s okay and we\u2019re okay. She usually responds quick. So I text her at 5, 7, 9, and then 11. The only reason I texted her so many times was because I could see she was actively checking her Snapchat and ignoring me when we were in the middle of something. She lies and says she didn\u2019t see these texts and when I call her to say I saw her checking Snapchat she immediately removed me as a friend. I think she was mad I caught her in a lie. We talk that night and breaking up comes up. But we don\u2019t do it.\n\nWe talk the next night to discuss everything after giving each other time. But we actually end up breaking up. \n\nI\u2019ve been handling it so bad. I want her back. But a part of me is like she was doing all of these sketchy things. Makes me wonder if she was out seeing someone else or what. She would tell me she loved me and missed me but wouldn\u2019t let me see her. I feel so confused. I feel like she felt guilty about things she was doing and didn\u2019t want to see my face. At the same time I don\u2019t think we built up enough trust prior to her leaving.

Flickering colors, dark gashing cracks, the whole deal. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I thought.\n\nWhen I looked up from my phone, I realized it wasn\u2019t the phone at all, but my actual vision.

I was still refusing to open my eyes. After some time, \nI felt a hand on my shoulder and a voice asking if I was alright. Terrified, I peeked my eyes opened and things had returned to normal. \n\nNaturally, I rushed home and hid in my room, googling and trying to find an explanation but didn\u2019t see anything that accurately described my experience.

I\u2019m 33. Never suffered with anxiety in my life. In the times I was anxious it was completely normal, excited anxiety for a big event that gave me an edge. I used to love it and get a buzz from it and then February last year I was hit by an absolute bomb that was months in the making. \n\nI suffered unknowingly my very first anxiety attack after I\u2019d had my evening meal.. my throat was swelling, I was choking, I couldn\u2019t breathe and when I could I couldn\u2019t even get a deep enough breath to survive. I rushed myself to the hospital and was given the all clear and sent on my way. Absolutely none the wiser at what had just happened less than an hour before. I wasn\u2019t even told I\u2019d potentially had an anxiety attack, I was just told there was a 5 hour wait for an ECG SCAN as I\u2019d told them my chest felt tight. I had calmed down but my throat tension was unbearable but I had a glass of water and magically it went... WHAT WAS THAT?!! \n\nOver the coming days I was rocked multiple times by anxiety attacks during sleep, during the evening and after meals. WHY and WHAT was happening to me. I still had no answers and no ideas what was happening to me and I went to the GP surgery in my local area.. I was diagnosed with acid reflux.. \n\nFor the past weeks and months I was petrified and terrified beyond belief. I was a mental potato with no idea why acid reflux was making me feel this way. This lasted for 8 months and finally I succumbed to a mental breakdown. The 24-7  tension in my throat had gone but now I was crippled with 24-7 tension headaches and feelings of going absolutely crazy and having upwards of 10 anxiety per day for weeks and weeks and then out of nowhere during an attack it somehow clicked that what I was going through were ANXIETY ATTACKS!.. for the past 5 months I have done so much god damn research on anxiety and anxiety attacks that I could write a flippin book on it. IT WAS CAUSED BY STRESS!!!! Anxiety is ONLY CAUSED BY 3 THINGS!!! Stress worry or fear but I promise you it is absolutely 100% possible to conquer it but you have to ride it out and give it time. I was crippled with anxiety attacks during my resting periods as I wasn\u2019t allowed to rest!! My body and mind were so used to stress of my life that when I went into REST AND DIGEST MODE my body and mind was like \u2018oh no you don\u2019t, you\u2019ve got no time for rest you\u2019re getting attacked by lions tigers and bears!! That\u2019s why anxiety strikes hardest through periods of rest and relaxation. It\u2019s because you are stressed whether you know it or not!!! I have been off work now for just under 5 months and I\u2019ve not had an anxiety attack for 3 weeks now. I don\u2019t feel 100% but I\u2019m getting there and I know that I will get there over the coming months. YOU CONQUER ANXIETY caused by stress by de stressing.. meditation, time on your own, moderate exercise like walking (DONT OVERDO IT.. strenuous exercise is also a stress on your body and not good for someone already stressed).. you need to teach you body and mind that the world you are living in is not DANGEROUS!! That\u2019s all it wants. Your brain processes stress exactly the same way whether you are getting attacked by lions or stressing at work. STRESS IS STRESS! And sooner or later if you keep getting attacked by lions constantly your body and mind are just going to stay in an anxious mode. It\u2019s that simple!! It takes months to reverse stress. Not days and not weeks. MONTHS!!  The anxiety and the anxiety attacks in my case will continue to happen until you\u2019ve shown your body and mind that you don\u2019t live in a stressful world. ITS THAT SIMPLE. You can\u2019t fight it. It\u2019s protecting you as you are showing it you are stressed. It\u2019s the best and most overprotective bodyguard you\u2019ll ever have. GET YOUR STRESS DOWN and then in 6 months come and tell me how you feel. You probably don\u2019t even realise just how stressed you are. INSOMNIA IS CAUSED BY STRESS 99/100. Your body and mind won\u2019t relax and switch off. I didn\u2019t sleep for longer than 30 minutes a night for over a month and then gradually it got better. Over the past month I\u2019ve managed to get to only waking up 4-5 times. My stress is coming down I can feel it in everything I do. \n\nIl ask you this one question? Who is the king of jungle? The lion. If you were to go to Africa now would the lion have a nose, ears, lungs, a heart, eyes, legs, a digestion system etc etc etc.. yes it would! Just like you do but if you seen a lion now what would it be doing.. IT WOULD BE LYING UNDER A TREE RELAXING!! it wouldn\u2019t be on the go 24-7. It eats, it plays and it relaxes. Why are you constantly busy always on the go! It\u2019s not healthy. The key to anxiety is treating your self well. Nutrition, rest and relaxation and sleep. Get out of stress mode I\u2019m begging you. \n\nTo conquer the excessive ridiculous anxiety worries about stupid things is simple. It\u2019s changing your mindset. Over the past 6 months I\u2019ve had panic attacks about going blind, having a tumour, having a stroke, going deaf, not being able to sleep at night due to everytime I closed my eyes I was petrified I was blind and couldn\u2019t see.. it was absolutely crazy. I was terrified my dad was going to die and it was constant. I changed this with one simple rule.. BAN THE PHRASE \u2018what if\u2019 and change it to \u2018I AM GRATEFUL FOR\u2019... \ninstead of saying \u2018what if my dad dies I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d manage\u2019 you say \u2018I am grateful that my dad has lived a long healthy 60 years of life and I\u2019ve got to spend it with him for 33 years I some people don\u2019t even get that privilege\u2019.. \n\nWhat if my headache it a tumour?.. \nI am grateful for having 33 years of good health and if I have a tumour I will face it and what will be will be. \n\nYou set these seeds in your mind as within weeks and months it\u2019ll just become normal and natural. Stop fighting for the life you want and start accepting the life you are going to get\n\nStress will destroy you more than anxiety will trust me. \n\nStress nearly killed me and I didn\u2019t even realise it. Whatever happens to any of you in life please don\u2019t let stress be the cause. Remember the king of the jungle rests as much as he can. \nTREAT YOURSELF WELL. Rest. Sleep and good nutrition. It will just take time but go for a walk a day in nature for an hour on your own. Within a month you\u2019ll feel the difference. Doctors and GPs will treat the symptoms, they won\u2019t treat the cause\n\nJust show your body and mind that the world you live in is safe and stress free and it will go when you no longer need it\u2019s protection.", "title": "HOW TO CURE ANXIETY IN 6 months"}, {"created_utc": 1617993435, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mnnogl/always_forget_how_change_of_plans_triggers_me/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "Was supposed to go on a hike with my boyfriend and his friends tomorrow, we don't see them often because they live far away.

I'm not officially diagnosed with anxiety or something similar because I never went to psychiatrist. Also **TRIGGER WARNING**, I'm going to rant about my current problems and I just want encouragement and advice from people that have been in my situation. Thank you for reading.\n\n**When did I start having anxiety issues?**\n\nIt started when I was little young, about the age of 5-6. I was a clumsy kid, innocent and very curious about how things work. One day, I decided to joke/mess up with a kid and the father of the kid confronted me in front of my neighbor friends. I was humiliated and ashamed of myself, I realized that everybody was laughing at me. The father also said that he will speak with my father whenever he sees him around the neighborhood. Few hours after the incident, my father had to go to pick up my mother with our car, and of course, my father invited me to come as well, just like we did everytime. In that same moment, I was very aware of myself, for the first time ever I realized that I don't want to do something because it **COULD** cause a problem to my parents and me. I realized that I want to stay **HOME**, so I could be **SAFE** from the kid's father(in this case, I saw him as a **THREAT**). I went with my father anyways, they had a conversation in front of me and the problem was resolved. I had many, many problems in the upcoming years, similar situations that I don't have to talk about them in this post. Stuttering also makes my social anxiety worse. I cannot control it sometimes and I'll never accept my stutter, I want it to go away but there's no cure for it(I can try speech therapist... but I think it's too late).\n\n**The fear of dying, but also wanting to end it.**\n\nThis is such a strange phenomenon, I keep thinking about suicide almost everyday. It has become like a daily habit which I cannot free myself from. I did imagine how I'm gonna do it, but I'm not strong enough to do it. I don't want my parents to suffer because of me, I cannot do such thing to them. I keep thinking that suicide will solve my problems, but it wouldn't, it will just pass them to someone else.\n\n **Work and life balance.**\n\nI've started working in February as an electrician. I went to school about that topic but I didn't learn much, I was only studying for the grades, I don't remember 95% of the things I've studied. I was lucky enough to get a job as an electrician because my mother knows the CEO of the company. I got employed with no experience whatsoever during the COVID pandemic(where nowadays it is very hard to get a job). But unfortunately, the coworkers were bullying me, I've heard them talk behind my back and I was terrible. I tried not to give a fuck, but that was unsuccessful, I cannot do that everyday for months! I resigned today after working there for 3 months. My parents did not support my decision and they told me that I'll eventually come back to my old habits of staying home and having poor health and diet(even though this is not going to be true, because now I have work habits and I'm determined to do the things I want to do).\n\n**My plans for the future.**\n\nI'm going to study to become a Frontend Web Developer. I'm going to use free online courses and videos to gain knowledge, I'm going to make myself a freelancer and manage the work on my own, because I realized that I'm not a teamwork person and I want to balance my life. Because of my past actions like: leaving a job, becoming a college dropout and being \"lazy\" - my parents think that I will return to my old habits, they simply do not believe in me anymore. \n\n**TLDR;** \n\n**It feels like I'm stuck in life even if I have so much time ahead of me.

It can make your days harder, and it can cause all sorts of problems. I by no means want to diminish that. But, at the same time, the more you think about how hard it is and the more you give it power to cause problems, the worse it gets.\n\nDoes that make sense?

In these dreams, I feel similar to when I have a panic attack in real life (writhing, screaming, yelling, pounding my feet, hitting myself), BUT because it is in a dream, I get NO catharsis from doing this, nor is there anyone/anything to 'ground' me, so I usually end up just slowly waking up from them in a state of utter terror or anger, which often throws a wrench into my day as I wake up with EXTREMELY strong emotions.

In early March, I went for my very first job interview. It was a major airline hiring for ground staff positions for my city's airport. There were two rounds with two different interviewers and the first one went better than the second, although I made quite a few mistakes in both. To my absolute surprise, I was selected. It was somewhat surreal and left me feeling aloof and incredulous for quite a while, perhaps I'll feel that way about it for the rest of my life. Anyway, there were a lot of additional formalities to be done which took quite a few days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to the last week of March, I had to travel to another city about 300 kilometres from my home and live at a hotel for about 30 days for training before starting work at my city's airport. Now, this was a dream come true for the most part but as a single child, who's largely domesticated and never stayed away from home for that long, I was fairly worried but my adult self was confident that I could pull it off, making reasonable adjustments and compromises along the way. Also, I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, which has only been aggravated or worsened by this hellish pandemic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy cab ride from home to the airport was fine, so was the flight to the city adjoining the city housing the training center. The airline company paid for my air ticket, it was my first time flying with that airline, and it was a pleasant experience. The cab ride from the destination city's airport to the hotel was somewhat dangerous, as the cab was crammed with five other people plus the driver, they were visiting for training as well and had arrived from different cities and flights, although all were wearing masks most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpon reaching the hotel, I realized that my room would be on a sharing basis and it was the same for all, new employees and experienced alike as the company was cutting costs due to the ongoing pandemic. Now for someone who's never shared a bed in his adulthood with another person other than parents or at best grandparents or uncles occasionally, this was a nightmare come true. To make matters worse, the hotel was buzzing with mosquitoes. For someone who's survived Dengue Fever, this was extremely worrying to say the least. The prospect of paying some extra money and having a single occupancy room for my stay was quickly eliminated as the per night cost was too high and the intended stay was for at least 30 nights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I settled into the sharing room, the roommate was initially out but later the receptionist introduced me to him, he was without a mask and from another part of the country, a city about 2000 kms. from my home although both of us could easily talk in English. I terminated a few mosquitoes with my hands and used a repellent machine throughout the night to make the room a little safer. There were two single beds, his stuff was all over the room but I decided to manage for the night and move to a different place the next evening. Few minutes after lights off, with his face facing me, without mask of course, he proceeded to cough violently multiple times, thankfully I was wearing a N95 respirator, and decided not to escalate it but simply mention it in the morning. And I did, right before leaving for induction day at the training center, he casually replied he had a negative COVID test report. But it wasn't just that, it was the grim reality of sharing a room and toilet with another stranger man for the next 30 days, something I had never done before. I had asked HR about accommodation details since the day I was selected but there was no response at all, now I finally knew why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I proceeded to the training center, I'll spare the hour by hour COVID related details although I am compelled to mention that at one point, over 30 persons were crammed into a small room with terrible ventilation for several hours and the officials didn't give two f\\*cks about masking or distancing. It was a long, tiring day, a lot of paperwork and formalities which took around 8 hours, from 9:00 to 17:00. I got back to that dreadful hotel, picked up my luggage, told the roommate I was moving out no offence, I'd have done it regardless of the other person, got into a cab and moved to another place in a single room for 3 nights until I figured out what to do next, possibly ask HR to provide a reasonably safer accommodation. I used some of the money given by family to book a room and went to a grocery store later to get some packaged snacks and stuff. Now this place was just a ten minute walk from the training institute and I believed I could manage for another 4 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first official training day was largely a waste of time as after a brief paperwork related session, no formal training took place as the trainer(s) was AWOL from 9:00 to 16:00, and you couldn't leave the training center between that time sans emergency although later some IT guys told us about online accounts and related things. The next day was fairly organized and productive as the trainer was early, we (me and other 22 trainees) were informed about the plans for the next 2 to 3 days, with focus on customer service, personal grooming, communication lectures, etc. Now, I've never had the need or requirement to purchase formal clothing prior to my first job interview as I did not attend any events or places that required formal clothing. I'd only purchased a pair of shirt and trousers for the interview and packed the same for my training period. I fully realize that I should've had the basic sense to know that formal training at a corporate institute would require formal clothing at all days and all times. It was terribly foolish of me not to plan and pack accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat trainer had informed us that all trainees will be rigorously examined for the next 10 days about their grooming and attire with surprise inspections and such, post which the company would provide all with their tailored uniforms. You could be picked out by any trainer or senior official at any point for unsatisfactory dressing or grooming and a second or third time of that would lead to adverse outcomes. In addition to this, I was completely out of any formal clothes and my new hotel had no laundry service and Google Maps told me the closest was at least 6 kms. and it was already evening. I realize that at this point I might be coming off as a spoiled, unprepared man-child who was suddenly placed out of his comfort bubble and I would not disagree with that one bit, perhaps if I'd have told myself the same thing during those moments or if someone would've slapped some sense into me during those hours I'd not have proceeded to make the most rash and silly mistake of my adult life....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, on the fourth evening, with the anxiety of the pandemic mounting, the feeling of being homesick swelling, my gross unpreparedness due to lack of any formal clothing, and no confirmation by HR regarding my new place of stay, although they told me they'll get a new one but again on sharing basis, I DECIDED TO LEAVE. As in, leave the city, told my mother and it was decided that my maternal uncle, who was about 50 kms. from my hotel, would accommodate me for sometime, until I could schedule my return home. Checked out of the hotel next morning, took the train, my uncle picked me up and took me to his place. I told no one at the company until early evening, that too via email. Spoke to a senior HR official later that evening, told my reasons for leaving, sincerely apologized for my terrible, unbecoming conduct and that I WANT TO RESIGN.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReached home the next day and formally tendered my resignation via email. To put it objectively, my first job interview and I land an entry level position in the ground staff with a top airline at my city's airport. My overly sensitive and severely compromised or limited ability to adjust and adapt cost me perhaps my biggest career opportunity. A couple days later I thoroughly apologized to the company officials, well I spoke only to a particular HR official, but I addressed the company at large in my emails, as until the moment I agreed to resign, they were very supportive and willing to better accommodate me and I was too mentally compromised to see it. I emailed HR asking if they could somehow consider a pardon or give me an opportunity to restore the damaged trust b/w me and the company as I was willing to do right by all and more than make it up, but alas it was too late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My days are now filled with toxic regret and diminishing hope as I literally kicked away a full career in aviation, decent pay, solid insurance, free or discounted staff air travel, but most importantly, a clear sense of direction and purpose and I DESTROYED IT, I KILLED IT.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PLEASE, PLEASE DEAR READERS, DO NOT MAKE IMPULSIVE DECISIONS, THINK VERY CAREFULLY AND AVOID RECKLESS DECISION-MAKING, ESPECIALLY ANYTHING RELATED TO YOUR CAREER OR LONG TERM FUTURE PROSPECTS, AT LEAST CONSULT WITH OTHERS OR REACH OUT FOR GUIDANCE.

Back in December of 2020, I developed anxiety for the first time in my life. It started off as occasional sleep disturbance, like once a week. Slowly, it started happening more often. Before I knew it, it started happening every night. I would go to bed around 11 and wake up at 3 am every night. This FREAKED ME THE FUCK OUT. I didn\u2019t know what was going on and why I kept waking up like this every night. As you can see, freaking out about not sleeping is not the best strategy. This quickly snowballed into me not being able to sleep AT ALL. I went 4-5 nights without sleep. It just couldn\u2019t fall asleep or stay asleep. I didn\u2019t know anxiety is a psychiatric condition (yes, I was that naive). I have never been to a mental health provider, so all this was new to me. Like any normal person, I thought I had developed a brain tumor. After a whole lot of blood tests and MRI and what not, I was diagnosed with anxiety and put on Zoloft with trazodone for sleep. \n\nIt has been 4 months now with a LOT of ups and downs. The sleep doctors I consulted with said that I didn\u2019t need to be on an ssri &amp; that I am going down a rabbit hole. Other doctors insisted that I need to be on ssri. It was so confusing dealing with all kinds of conflicting advice. I got freaked out that I am on the wrong medication &amp; with my GPs approval cut down my Zoloft dosage and started tapering trazodone. This caused a lot of instability in my sleep and my overall mood. Finally, I managed to get a psychiatrist (it was so hard to find one available &amp; it took forever to get an appointment). So, based on his advice I am back to 25mg of Zoloft and 50mg of trazodone for sleep. I am now relatively stable. I get 5.5-6 hrs of sleep every night. I am functioning normal for the most part, doing my job etc. \n\nSo why am I posting here? I guess I am looking for some reassurance. I know these meds saved my life. I was in a very very dark place when sleep was non existent. Taking Zoloft and trazodone pulled me out of the abyss. BUT, I cannot shake the feeling of unease that I am having to take medication to go to sleep. Even during the thanksgiving break in 2020, I was sleeping 8-9hrs uninterrupted every night &amp; have always been like that my whole life. So, suddenly having to rely on medication every night makes me feel out of control. My doctors (both the GP and psychiatrist) are cool about it. \n\nI want to add that I have a 7year old &amp; really really want to be the best mom possible and give her a happy childhood. But, I am so worried about the effect of these medications. Is it ok to take trazodone long term , if that means I am functioning like a normal person? It feels like a crutch that I am unwilling to let go of at this point. The few months of terrible insomnia has traumatized me so much.

Encouragement? This week has been the week from hell. My depression has been flaring up over the last few months, pretty badly. So this week my doctor decided that I had been on Zoloft for 2+ years so maybe I was too use to it? So started me on, Prozac? Lower dose, and just nah bro.\n\nChanged medicine on Wednesday, I think I cried 4 times yesterday, and I'm usually really good at keeping myself together in front of people. Also being irrationally angry about stuff. Whoo, that's fun. I'm also anxious cause I work for my city, in the utilities so I have to take a phone every so many weeks to answer after hours calls. Angry customers/Panicked/emergencies etc. And it's been ringing way too much for my anxiety.\n\nThen at the beginning of this week my husband hurt himself, took him to the doctor Tuesday and turns out he has a stress fracture in his foot. His job is 90% standing so we figured he would end up not working, but nah, his bosses first question was \"You're still coming in tomorrow right?\" so I have to help him emotionally, physically, even when I feel like I have nothing else to give.\n\nOH not to mention I got tested for COVID for the THIRD TIME. Negative, but only because I had a headache and my body runs warm so when they tested my temperature it was 99.0. So that's great.\n\nSo we live in an apartment without laundry so we take ours to a laundromat once a week, which my husband usually does cause he works less hours than me. But now that he's hurt, and I'm on call. I asked my mom if she could help and she agreed and asked if there was anything else we needed, nope, we got it handled. I can do it next week when I don't have the possibility of being called away at any moment for any length of time. \n\nSo my husband is really bad at being the patient, he's great at helping other people out but when it comes to him, he's bad at asking for help. So when he called me Wednesday asking for help getting food, I dropped everything and went to help him with my bosses permission. And even that I was getting judged on by coworkers, and apparently my mother. Because when I dropped off our laundry I got to hear about how great her relationship with my one sister is, and how she vented to her about how I was babying my husband and he was an adult. And I literally cried when I got to my car, because ya know, anxiety and feeling like you make the wrong choices all the time.\n\nAnd to TOP IT ALL OFF, today I drive around for work this morning, got myself some breakfast when I was done to bring back to my office before my meeting in a few hours, and while I'm parking my work car in the garage and balancing crap heading inside. The on call phone rings, and while I'm negotiating everything I end up dumping my food on the ground, and my drink on top of it. I'm surprised I didn't have a break down right then and there. On the bright side a coworker came up and helped me, and after I got myself cleaned up (did I mention I got it all over myself too) and replaced my food and drink went out to clean up the garage to find the puddle was 1/4th the size and all the ice was gone. So he must have cleaned it up which was nice of him.\n\nSo yeah, just a hell of a week to change medications, I'm overwhelmed, my anxiety is 112 out of 10, and I am nauseous and hurting all over.

Six months ago, my family and I were on the edge of death, hospitalized with severe consequences of COVID. I'd like to share what helped me to overcome the depression, physical and emotional pain, and to deal with the anxiety of losing the beloved ones and my own life.\n\nEverything started 4 years ago when two of my friends and I were tired of playing online games like World of Warcraft. At some point, we started reading books on philosophy and psychology, just for fun and natural curiosity. We discussed Plato, Seneca, Kant, and occasionally some modern thinkers like Taleb or Peterson. As our interest grew, we invited a few more friends and started a philosophy club, where we are still meeting every week for the discussions.\n\nFrom that time, we had more than 260 meetings, and every time we would write a short summary with the most practical mental exercises and frameworks found in the books.\n\nI personally thought that it's so abstract, and I actually rarely used those exercises in my everyday life.\n\nBut then suddenly I was diagnosed with covid. And all the theoretical hardships described in Stoic preachings became real.\n\nAfter a week the things went so bad that my father, mother, and grandmother were all hospitalized with severe consequences. I remember the moment when my father came from FMRI. We were told that 90% of his lungs to be damaged. He had a forced smile on his face trying to hide despair and terror from my mother and me. He was so depressed with the situation, and so was I.\n\nDoctors had to put him in intensive care to connect him to an artificial lungs ventilation machine. After he was released from intensive care, he was constantly out of breath, experiencing severe coughing pain.\n\nHe was too weak to move. I felt hopeless and desperate; I searched for guidance to alleviate his suffering. Then I suddenly recalled that I have saved exercises. So I started to introduce him to specific practices and thought experiments on coping with pain that we gathered in our philosophy club.\n\nWhen my father first started his rehabilitation, he couldn't bear to finish the daily walk prescribed by the doctors. He experienced severe pain from the intensified breathing and was out of breath all the time.\n\nThe prescriptions of doctors were so harsh and painful, that he lost faith that he could recover. He got what is called learned helplessness - when a person has experienced a stressful situation repeatedly.  And he came to believe that he was unable to control or change the situation, so he thought he should not even try at all.\n\nBut then, we practiced Stoic exercises for 10-15 minutes together every morning before breakfast.\n\nAfter just a few weeks of following this practice, my father started regaining faith in himself. He managed to finish more and more walks, as he learned to cope with his pain and discomfort better.\n\nAfter this (quite dramatic) first-hand experience of the impact of practical philosophy, I decided to share the actual exercise I used with the community on Reddit.\n\nI understand that most of you might not have time for 1000+ pages of philosophical tractates, as they are both enormous in size and hard to read.\n\nSo below is a version of the exercise I used in the time of my hardships. I put it in a straightforward and concise form of guidance as if you were talking with the stoic thinker Seneca.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!Exercise!&lt;\n\n&gt;*Hi, my name is Seneca. I am a statesman and Stoic. I lived during the reign of Emperor Nero, a pretty tough time, to be honest.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*And as you know, tough times bring a lot of pain, both physical and emotional. Given that we all experience tough times and pain throughout our lifetime, we must learn how to deal with them in the right way.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So our goal for this lesson is to explore how to cope with physical pain in a stoic way.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*When you feel physical pain, the mind's role in forming your reaction is harder to see. Pain seems like an immovable fact that owes nothing and has no relation to our thinking.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Yes, pain is pain: a sensation that exists no matter what we think about it.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*But even then, we, Stoics, insist that our judgments about those feelings produce our experience of them.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So how much our pain bothers us, how much attention we pay to it, and what it means to us is determined by our judgments.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Because of the natural connection between the mind and the body, those judgments infiltrate the self-talk we engage while being in pain.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***What kind of pain bothers you now or bothered you recently?***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***How do you talk to yourself while in pain? In what words you describe your pain to yourself and other people with whom you share it?***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*When we feel such kind of pain, we usually say to ourselves: \"My day is ruined. Why always me? Why do I have this headache again.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*When you describe pain in such emotionally triggering and negative language, you make a big deal out of it - amplifying your distress.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Instead, you should try to remember that pain is neither unendurable nor everlasting. You can keep its limits in mind and not escalate the pain through your own imagination and self-talk.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*There is a technique that Stoics call 'Phantasia kataleptike' or viewing bodily sensations objectively.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*That means that we try to describe external events and bodily sensations as natural processes.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Instead of saying, \"My head is going to explode. My day is ruined.\" it's better to say, \"There's a feeling of pressure around my forehead.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*It's as if we were describing another person's problems: with greater objectivity and detachment, like a doctor documenting illness symptoms in a patient.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Now, describe your pain as if it is perceived by another person. What is this person (you) experiencing? By doing this you transform negative self-talk into the objective description.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*By depersonalizing yourself talking about pain, it is possible to change your emotional reaction towards the pain and reduce the intensity of the pain itself.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*This prevents us from focusing too much on the worst-case scenario, catastrophizing our pain to the point where we feel overwhelmed and entirely consumed by it.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*In addition to this form of cognitive distancing, it is also helpful to think of pain as confined to a particular body part rather than allowing it to spread.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*For example, if you have aching teeth, try to imagine a line around your mind, marking its boundaries, with all bodily sensations, including your teeth pain, on the other side.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Next time you experience pain, try to draw a line around the mind, marking its boundaries, with bodily sensations on the other side, as if viewed from a distance.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Don't make your ills worse for yourself and burden yourself with complaints. Pain is slight if opinion adds nothing to it. If, on the contrary, you start to encourage yourself and say, \"It's nothing, or certainly very little; let's hold out, it will soon leave off\" \u2013 then in thinking it slight, you will make it so.*\n\nGlad you read till this point:) Hope you still have the energy for some closing remarks.\n\nI encourage you to share this exercise with the people you care about and who experience any kind of pain right now. All of us have friends or family members who need that.\n\nIf it helps them to endure the pain and make it even 10% lighter, that's already a huge help.\n\nP.S.

They are overwhelming, and they have physical as well as emotional symptoms.\n\nMany people with panic attacks may have difficulty breathing, sweat profusely, tremble, and feel their hearts pounding.\n\nSome people will also experience chest pain and a feeling of detachment from reality or themselves during a panic attack, so they may think they\u2019re having a heart attack. Others have reported feeling like they are having a stroke.\n\nPanic attacks\u00a0can be scary and may hit you quickly. Here are 11 strategies you can use to try to stop a panic attack when you\u2019re having one or when you feel one coming on:\n\n1. Use deep breathing\n\nWhile hyperventilating is a symptom of panic attacks that can increase fear, deep breathing can reduce symptoms of panic during an attack.\n\nIf you\u2019re able to control your breathing, you\u2019re less likely to experience the hyperventilating that can make other symptoms \u2014 and the panic attack itself \u2014 worse.\n\nFocus on taking deep breaths in and out through your mouth, feeling the air slowly fill your chest and belly and then slowly leave them again. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a second, and then breathe out for a count of four:\n\n\ufffcShare on Pinterest\n\n2. Recognize that you\u2019re having a panic attack\n\nBy recognizing that you\u2019re having a panic attack instead of a heart attack, you can remind yourself that this is temporary, it will pass, and that you\u2019re OK.\n\nTake away the fear that you may be dying or that impending doom is looming, both symptoms of panic attacks. This can allow you to focus on other techniques to reduce your symptoms.\n\n3. Close your eyes\n\nSome panic attacks come from triggers that overwhelm you. If you\u2019re in a fast-paced environment with a lot of stimuli, this can feed your panic attack.\n\nTo reduce the stimuli, close your eyes during your panic attack. This can block out any extra stimuli and make it easier to focus on your breathing.\n\n4. Practice mindfulness\n\nMindfulness can help ground you in the reality of what\u2019s around you. Since panic attacks can cause a feeling of detachment or separation from reality, this can combat your panic attack as it\u2019s approaching or actually happening.\n\nFocus on the physical sensations you are familiar with, like digging your feet into the ground, or feeling the texture of your jeans on your hands. These specific sensations ground you firmly in reality and give you something objective to focus on.", "title": "4 ways to handle an immediate panic attack."}, {"created_utc": 1614705281, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lw7739/would_love_to_know_about_our_personal_methods_we/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Would love to know about our personal methods we use to manage high scale panic attacks ?"}, {"created_utc": 1614704787, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lw6zm2/my_family_is_what_has_caused_the_majority_of_my/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "i wouldn\u2019t have the constant judging eyes, i wouldn\u2019t have to feel guilty ab how i spend my money &amp; time, i wouldn\u2019t have the pressure of my parents wanting me to buy a house, get married, be a mom. \n\nwhat if i wanted to live w my bf secluded w our pets forever?? so what??? why can\u2019t i do what i want without feeling shitty.", "title": "my family is what has caused the majority of my anxiety &amp; sometimes i wish i could move away &amp; leave everyone behind"}, {"created_utc": 1614704248, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lw6r6w/i_need_help_getting_help/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Over the past couple of months I\u2019ve finally decided that I want to seek professional psychiatric help with my anxiety.

I was often made fun of &amp; left out of activities and get-togethers.

I meet a lot of people (my bf is a social butterfly) but I know my awkwardness makes boring and forgettable.

Never decided to get therapy or medication, and honestly, I probably should have. However during the peak of my anxious years of highschool, I remember abusing stimulants heavily. I was a gym rat, and would take a heavily dosed high stim preworkout every afternoon just to get an edge. These preworkout usually contained 300mg of caffeine along with a myriad of synthetic stimulants and aggressive chemicals. Along with my preworkout, I was drinking coffee in the mornings to get through the day. This later turned into Bang energy drinks. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for me to drink two or three bangs a day. I recall watching old videos of me cracked out on caffeine, tweakin and fidgeting in the back of the class and being absolutely awestruck at how crazy I was at that time. At this point in my life, my anxiety was sky high. I was afraid to leave my house, afraid to look people in the eye, afraid to drive my car, afraid to breath to hard near others, and even afraid to make too much noise opening and closing the bathroom stall door. Ridiculous.  Now, you\u2019re probably thinking.. why would I continue to do this if my anxiety was so bad? The truth is, I was addicted to caffeine not for the stimulant effects, but because of how confident and happy it made me feel. If I was super stimmed out, it was coin toss where I would either feel like Superman and have an amazingly fun and productive day, or feel strung out, twitch, and sweat like a pig.

When we were doing the project, I did everything to provide them with the materials and instructions, I also gave them my previous works for the project so that they can have an idea on how to do it (since this was the first time that they were gonna do it), however, not only did they blatantly refused to follow the instructions, they have also rejected the fact to paraphrase the words, in which if they don't, we can and will be accused of plagiarism. Aside from that, most of their works were actually far from our topic, and so, I was forced to correct their work, as well as replace those that are incorrect.\n\nRight now, I am currently in a new group. And my members are not cooperating. I have already reminded them so many times to do their parts, and last night, I have private messaged them, but guess what. They said that they still haven't talked about their parts, and thus, they still have no work done.\n\nI just can't handle this anymore.

First and foremost my life in the form of papers and important documents have been organised into folders, sentimental stuff that I'm not yet ready to get rid off has been organised in bags according to context, like my military service, friends etc. and has been put in a plastic box in the attic. My main source of unorganised clutter now is in the shape of stuff on my computer. My philosophy is that I don't necessarily need to get rid of it right away, I start with organising it, and then I declutter when time permits. What I do for now is I've for example made a bookmark-folder called \"organised bookmarks\" with a bunch of subfolders. So even if I've got tens of thousands of unorganised bookmarks from the past, whatever new ones will be organised (I hope).\n\nAnyway, so I was gonna mention a few ideas, but I think I might forget some of them, but here are some:\n\n1. I want to create a full inventory list of everything I own. I'm not sure how specific, maybe not the number of pictures I have in my friends-bag in my sentimentality-box, but definitely the number of t-shirts I have etc, so somewhere in between.\n2. I want a shopping-list for each room, so when I go to the store once a week I can go through every rooms list and make the full list. I also have 2 extra of everything, so when I throw one toothpaste away, I take one out from the cupboard, got one in reserve and I write it on the list.\n3. I've been for the last few weeks had an hour every sunday where I go through my phone, delete or transfer pictures, messages, bookmarks etc, but I seem to always realise I can add more to that list, like suddenly I remembered I had saved 37 vids on youtube to watch later, and opened 57 tabs in chrome that I haven't dealt with.\n4. I've been trying to run my day through a thoroughly thought out schedule. Up at 0500AM, in the gym by 0530AM, practice guitar then and then, etc, at some point I wish to implement a very thorough nutrition plan as well.\n\nNow, the reason I'm writing this post is... I'm not sure. I'm wondering if it makes sense I guess, or if I sound like a massive case of OCD. Maybe anyone has been where I am now and progressed. I don't know if this process will give me the peace I long for. Currently I notice how much stress I feel by chasing after this organisational nirvana, and I'm not sure if I'm overdoing this or if it's just because I need to give myself time to get used to these high standards.\n\nAll replies appreciated, including the ones suggesting I might have some issues (I do) :)\"", "title": "The search and longing for order and organisation in ones life in an effort to minimise the power anxiety holds"}, {"created_utc": 1633909707, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/q5jnto/trigger_warning_anciety_over_job_interview/", "num_comments": 16, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a job interview tomorrow and I been freaking out over it.

In fact, a few days ago, speaking on the phone triggered shortness of breath and I went to the ER. Of course, everything they ran there (EKG, Chest X-Ray) came back clear, with 98% o2 levels. Of course, they convinced me it was anxiety and sent me home with Xanax (which I haven't touched). \n\nI came home feeling hopeless.

I'm on steroid inhalers, a biologic, and 2 antihistamines a day. He said the next course of action is to check my sinuses (bc I've had severe nasal congestion) and then if that's fine, to see a heart specalist to see if it's my heart. If that's clear too, he said I should be content with knowing it's anxiety.\n\nAny time that I think about being short of breath, it's almost like I start gasping for air and taking deep breaths which sometimes don't go through. But I've noticed if I'm working on something deeply (like an assignment that's due soon), I don't even notice I'm short of breath until I stop and realized I haven't thought about it, which elicits a deep breath or so.

However, I do have a lot of stress in my life right now because my medical problems in the last several months with asthma have caused me to fall behind a lot in school work, become socially isolated and stop seeing friends (in fear of an attack happening in public or not being able to talk a lot due to my asthma), gone back to working from home and avoiding the delta variant, and my parents constantly being upset about my downhill pattern. I used to exercise all the time and run 6-7 miles a day before, only to now be barely taking walks once in a while or going out for groceries or something because of the constant shortness of breath.

I just like providing context. \n\nSo I'm (24M) and I'm getting real serious feelings for this girl (20F) at work. We work at our school's dining hall and we work together sometimes. I really started to noticed her last fall, and at the beginning of this year I started to talk to her. It's been a slow process because I'm very introverted, shy and socially anxious. Plus just general anxiety. But now after a few months, and me continually and actively trying to talk to her and know her, I'd say we're definitely more friendly and we talk regularly during work now. She's really nice and kind, she has a warm presence to her and, I like her. I like her a lot. I kinda didn't want to admit that because I'm self-conscious towards myself a lot of the time, and I didn't want to develop strong feelings for someone and have to deal with interacting with them. I could make things easily awkward or uncomfortable. \n\nBut getting to know her has been really nice. However, our interactions are all still within a work context and most of our conversations are regarding school or work, relatively surface level stuff. Although recently, we've gotten to reveal a bit more personal information, so I think that's a good sign. And the more I learn about her, the more I like her. I'm also more invested in the stuff she's got going on outside of work and I hope that she's not stressing too much over the things that are bothering her. I'm afraid though that I'm getting too caught up with my feelings. I think about her a lot know, she's popped up randomly in a few dreams where the only thing that happens is that we're hanging out and talking. When I see her at work now I can't help but smile. So I've developed these feelings and they've progressed more than I thought they would, and now I actually am very much considering asking her out.\n\nThere are a few things that make me apprehensive and are currently preventing me from making the next leap. The first and most obvious is that I'm afraid that she doesn't like me like that. I know she likes me as a person to work with and sometimes talk to, but romantically I don't know. I haven't really tried to do things to figure out if she likes me, mainly cause we're at work, and also cause I can't flirt. I've always had a hard time figuring out if someone likes me. I blame my poor social skills and lack of dating experience. And if she doesn't like me like that, then that's okay. I can't really change how a person feels. That actually goes to my second point which is that I do like her as a person, as a possible friend, so I don't want that to go away. And lastly, my anxiety is making this all so difficult. This is really an issue with easy solutions (do it or don't do it) but my anxiety is making it seem like a daunting task, and it's making me overthink. \n\nIn general it takes a lot for me to like someone romantically, and in the context of work I never even entertain the idea of asking someone out because I never want to create a situation where I make someone uncomfortable and it just seems risky. So I really did consider not doing anything for a while. But I really need to resolve my own feelings and asking her out and finding out if she does or doesn't like me will obviously help with that. Part of me really does want to see where this goes. It's just that my anxiety is really stopping me from doing anything right now, I just freeze up.

I just broke up with my girlfriend the other day and I feel so terrible about it. Deep down I know I didn\u2019t feel right in the relationship, but I still really care for her and the last thing I want is to hurt her.\nBased on my experience with her, I\u2019d say she she is emotionally immature. She\u2019s never had a boyfriend before me. \nOver the last month, I felt more and more brushed off by her for a few different reasons. This is going to sound ironic, because it\u2019s usually the other way around, but she became super into video games (I built her a PC) while I only like to PC game on occasion, and I have other hobbies that I\u2019ve taken up, such as music and playing the guitar. I was definitely more into video games in high school but I don\u2019t mind it from time to time nowadays. Anyway, she would invite me to play often and I would, mainly because I enjoyed her company and enjoyed talking to her, even though I didn\u2019t take our games too seriously. After a while, she stopped inviting me more and more and she would make plans with her other friends online (who I\u2019ve met). We had plans one thursday, but she cancelled a few days prior because she was stressed about a final project she had and she got an extension on it until Thursday, meaning she couldn\u2019t fulfill our plans because she had to finish her assignment. Which I was totally okay with, school comes first. But it really didn\u2019t seem like this assignment was her main reason for cancelling... she was spending a lot of time with her friends online, and spent all of Thursday night online with her friends. I started making comments that we should hop online and play something, and she said \u201csoon\u201d or \u201ceventually\u201d or something to that effect. When she continued to not ask or invite me, and she continued making other plans, I brought it up in a respectful way. I asked her if everything is okay between us , since she seemed to be making other plans even though I had been trying to initiate. She said that the only times she can interact with her friends are online, and I\u2019m the only person she sees right now (because of COVID-19, we formed a \u201csocial bubble\u201d) so she\u2019s trying to spend some time with her friends. She also said she really values the time we have together. And I was totally okay with that, I told her it\u2019s super important to make time for your friends and hobbies. Anyway, we had plans the following Thursday, which I was really looking forward to. I tried to make it really special for her (bought her and her mum flowers and got her her favourite ice cream the night before). Thursday comes, and hours before she comes over, she tells me she wants to be home earlier than usual because she wants to hop on a game with a friend she met met online, because her friend has been going through a tough time or something. I said okay. When she came over, she was super tired, and ended up falling asleep on me twice while we were watching our show together, which was shitty. She ended up leaving even earlier than she asked (she said she was tired and had a headache) and got home and played her games late into the night. I think the reason she was so tired in the first place is because she was up late doing the same thing the night before.   The next day (Friday), we had a virtual game night planned (about a week in advance) but she cancelled a few days prior because she didn\u2019t \u201cfeel like being social in a big group\u201d. I said sure, I understand, no problem. Friday comes, and she breaks off into a smaller group to play a game (that I could have very well been invited to). I asked her to go on a drive because there was something I wanted to talk about, and she didn\u2019t want to because, I guess she doesn\u2019t like confrontation. She wanted to have this conversation over text. I said sure, and I basically explained to her that I have no problem with you making time for your hobbies and friends, but if it\u2019s at the expense of me and my time, I don\u2019t appreciate that. I also told her that she told me she really valued our time (as mentioned previously), and these instances were making me question that. \nIt felt like I was met with a bunch of excuses.. her being overwhelmed, and she also said she feels pressure to be open with me and have a deep connection with me and she doesn\u2019t really care about what her friends think, so she\u2019s been spending a lot of time with them as sort of an escape. I asked if there was anything I did on my end to make her feel overwhelmed or pressured, and she said no. I was just confused. I asked her if she needed some space, and she said yes, because she didn\u2019t want to feel any more overwhelmed with school coming up (which, so do I).\nA day later, I break up with her. I just felt like I became less and less of a priority. But I can\u2019t help this feeling of guilt. Feeling like I didn\u2019t try hard enough to make it work. Feeling like I didn\u2019t try to stick through the bad times. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life and these kinds of things have a bad impact on my mental health. I\u2019ve been struggling so much over the last few days. Thankfully my parents are super supportive, and I\u2019ve reached out to a social worker to talk about how I\u2019ve been feeling. I could just use more opinions from people who are objective to the situation. \nI really think I was a reasonable guy and I didn\u2019t ask for too much, but I felt brushed off.

It wasn't that I didn't know the material well enough, I'd memorised it and given it confidently to myself about 20 times (the fact I had to do this for a 2 slide 1 minute presentation should paint a picture). It's just the moment I started speaking in front of the 7 or so other people on the call I just crashed - voice very shaky, could hardly control my breath (I know sometimes the audience doesn't notice but trust me this wasn't one of those times).

So, on Wednesday, I start taking my meds again, but I'm still feeling *off*.\n\nThursday passes, I cry over at my boyfriends place that night and he helps me out, and then Friday I go in to work. I'm just feeling awful. All these thoughts I haven't had in a long time start coming up. \"I'm awful, no one loves me, everyone hates me, no one wants me here, I would just be better off dead.\" I'm literally sobbing in the back room by this point. I keep trying to go work the floor, but I have to keep running to the back to collect myself. \n\nMy coworker, I'll call her Abby, comes and talks to me and says she will ask my boss if I can leave. I keep trying to work, running to the back periodically, and Abby eventually says \"boss says you can't leave because she's training and we would be under on hours.\" Just *knowing* that I'm stuck, caged, at a place I can't leave just freaks me out even more. I lock myself in the bathroom and I keep trying to calm down but its not working. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, Abby messages me and says \"boss says you can leave.\" I collect myself, and I try to get back to work, but im still having to run to the back every 10 minutes or so. This entire time, in a small little store where only FOUR people work, my boss has ignored me. Hasn't said a word to me. Walked past me crying multiple times. \n\nBy this time, I've been at work for around 4 or 5 hours and I can't take it anymore. My boss won't talk to me, she keeps walking away when I try to get her attention, so I decide to just leave. I clock out (by now Abby has left), tell the woman my boss is training that im leaving, and I leave. \n\n40 minutes later, my boss messages me asking if I'm coming back. I tell her that Abby said I could leave. She freaks out on me in text and gets mad. I ask her if I should come back and she just says \"no.\" I'm still freaking out at this point, but by now I'm over at my best friends house and he's helping calm me down. I was halfway out the door and to my car when my boss first messaged me and he was like \"you don't need to go back whatever she says,\" but I didn't want to lose my job. Whatever, the day passes, my panic and hysteria subside, and im able to calm down enough to play some cards with my friend. He does a really good job cheering me up and keeping me calm. \n\nThe next day I go into work, I work with my boss, and she completely ignores me her entire shift. Doesn't say a word to me. I've calmed down mostly by now, I can feel that my meds are back in my system, but by now I'm seething. Shes acting cold towards me, won't talk to me when I try to get her attention, and goes out of her way even to avoid communicating with me. \n\nHonestly, im at a loss what to do. She is working at a different store this week, but she has still yet to talk to me about what happened. She called me Tuesday to get some paperwork and she was very pleasant, like she didn't just ignore me while I was having a breakdown, but im kind of just astounded.

I can't really report her, the district manager would tell her and she would immediately know it was me and should would go back to being rude and cold to me.

It was one of the most terrifying, claustrophobic things I\u2019ve ever been through, even without health anxiety. At one point it was so hard to breathe I didn\u2019t sleep for five days straight, and barely slept for at least a month.

Finally started to stop being so on edge about that, then last week a plank of wood fell and hit me on the head and left a massive bump (rang doctor and said it was probably fine just to keep an eye on it).\n\n\nI started experiencing derealisation for the first time in my life near the end of that chest infection (not sure why it happened as I was starting to calm down, it scared me again and put me back in crisis mode).

I was not and never attracted to kids. Never ever. I hated cp, child abuse, any of it. It infuriated me. But since my POCD started I\u2019ve been scanning my past for anything that could prove I\u2019m a pedophile and:\n\n\nJust Today I remembered that when I was 12-14 I used to read stories/fanfictions where a traumatic thing would happen to one of the characters so The other character would comfort them and help them heal and save them I guess. I think it was cuz I was going through some things at the time and just really wanted to be comforted so I guess that\u2019s why I read them, but some of the traumatic things that happened were incredibly disturbing, though I never liked or read for those scenes, I read for the comfort and the person getting saved. And before u say I\u2019m super weird for Just the trauma comfort thing,  there was recently a tiktok that went viral about this exact thing where people imagined traumatic situations for the comfort afterwards, and thousands of others did the same thing. Idk why I liked the hurt/comfort genre. I guess I just wished someone had saved me. Idk.\n\nBasically these traumatic  things could range from the character losing a loved one, being abused physically/sexually, getting an almost deadly injury like a car accident, having depression or an eating disorder, or even something as simple as having a nightmare and being comforted after etc. it didn\u2019t really matter because I wasn\u2019t reading for those things, I was reading because I liked the comfort of the character saving/helping them heal and loving them and stuff I guess.\n\nWhat I\u2019m feeling particularly horrified about is that some of these contained like child sexual abuse. They were not meant to be erotica or anything it was always described as painful and traumatic and was meant to disturb the reader and make them mad at the abuser, which it defintey did and I usually skimmed or skipped those parts because I didn\u2019t wanna see that. I wanted to see the comfort and healing. I NEVER got off to these topics, they disturbed me. I read these fanfictions for the emotional aspect I gues. Never ever for sexual gratification. I specifically expressed even when I was 14 that I didn\u2019t like those scenes anyway so I guess feel a bit better about that. But I just feel tremendous tremendous guilt that I ever read that. It\u2019s so fucked up. Some were so fucking disturbing I just skipped right over it and I expressed to a friend who also read it that I couldn\u2019t believe the author could write those flashback scenes, but I kept reading the story because the present day comfort after the bad stuff was so heartwarming, and I just skipped the disturbing parts.\n\nI remember if the story was all hurt/trauma and no comfort, I would drop it cuz it made me sad and I wasn\u2019t there for the hurt I needed the comfort. I was literally only there for the comfort and if it was just hurt I hated it. So I know I was reading it for that and not the bad stuff.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel like a monster that I ever read those stories. Like the ones with child abuse. Now I\u2019m scared I\u2019m a pedophile or just a horrible human being because I\u2019ve seen such horrid scenes in stories when I was up to 14. I\u2019m so disgusted that I ever read it. I DO NOT like or support child abuse. When I found out about the hollywood sex trafficking ring and the child abuse going on there I was so ANGRY and wanted to save all those children and I HATED it. I am not attracted to kids at all and I in no way like any of the traumatic topics I listed above. But I just had to get this off my chest. I want to end it because of the guilt and fear that I\u2019m a monster, that I read such horrific scenes even tho I skipped a lot of them, some I read. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to forgive myself for this. And now I\u2019m getting compulsions to find those stories again and read them to see if they weren\u2019t that bad or something (I get internet compulsions where I have to search up the things that scares me. Or sucks.) but I\u2019ll resist the compulsion, it\u2019ll only make it worse.", "title": "Feeling extreme guilt and anxiety about how when I was 13-14 I read fanfictions with disturbing topics becuase of the comfort afterwards.

I've struggled with OCD a good majority of my early childhood to later teens. I never been diagnosed but it was severe enough that the traits were easily noticeable and my Father has had many of the same issues.  Today my OCD is almost completely dormant in my mind. I have learned that exposing myself to impulsive thoughts and neglecting to act on them has retrained my mind immensely. Neglecting these thoughts at first were troublesome since they would send me into full panic and I had to take a break from whatever I was doing. As of now though I rarely have impulsive thoughts, and If I do they are easily neglected with no anxiety following afterwards.\n\n**ISSUES NOW:**\n\nSo what I'm currently battling while not severe is definitely an annoyance. I have an issue that can be closely related to social anxiety. Im normally pretty outgoing and have no issues striking up conversation. Every once in a while though when talking to someone I start to get all shaky most noticeably with my head, and I struggle with talking after it strikes me at random during conversation. I've noticed this issue to be with people I'm somewhat unfamiliar with and trying to impress. Although it can be someone I'm familiar with as long as if its an environment that I don't share with them often. (EX: Going to a coworkers house for the first time.)  Also the thoughts of not trying to get nervous often run through my mind before I do which might be a trigger. This issue of mine has gotten progressively worse. My head never used to shake when I was nervous around people. Just like most, my hands may be a little shaky and a noticeable quiver in my voice before, but it has gained momentum since then.\n\nId love to combat this with exposure but unfortunately that wouldn't be productive because I cant really replicate this with someone personal and Id rather not embarrass myself with an acquaintance.

Left to my own devices, I will sit in my room and do essentially nothing for as long as possible, and COVID made it possible to do that for a *long* time. Just recently I flew out of town to visit a friend for a week, and we went and did stuff every day. Not all of every day\u2014sometimes we didn't wake up before noon. And not necessarily big stuff\u2014we'd go for a walk in the park, or just go shopping for things to make dinner with. But after I flew back home, I felt incredible. Not \"cured\"; I still catch myself clenching my fists in response to various triggers, I'm still shocked by sudden, loud noises, and I don't have the motivation I imagine \"normal\" people having. Still, I managed to apply for several jobs, and I wound up getting one. I start early next week, and I'm a little nervous, but overall I think I'm looking forward to it. I might even end up going back to school in a year or two if things keep looking up.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, I'm worried that they won't keep looking up. This sudden windfall of energy doesn't feel earned, and I don't know whether I can count on it. I don't know where it came from. I've had no recent changes in meds (still the same high doses of antidepressants and Buspirone that I've been on for over a year now) and I still haven't managed to make an appointment with a therapist since well before COVID.

But if I can't count on myself to keep being able to live in the world and be a person, how can I convince myself it's a good idea to rent an apartment, or get a loan on a car? How do I know I won't slip back into old habits this winter and become unable to leave the house? Or, if not this winter, maybe the next, or the one after that? If I get laid off, will that be such a blow to my ego that I have to spend another year licking my wounds before I can make myself apply for another one?

I typically don\u2019t post about my anxiety problems because I have this stupid mentality that I can solve it by myself; but it gets challenging at times. Like right now (as of writing this) I\u2019ve reached a point where I\u2019ve had enough of this shit (pardon my language, but do note there might be more cuss words ahead). I have this weird fucking problem where any tiny-ass fucking pain I feel gives me a panic attack. It\u2019s driving me crazy. Especially when it comes to stomach pain. It\u2019s like, I have a phobia about my appendix; I fear that, you know, one day it\u2019s just gonna fucking explode on me and end up sending me to the pearly gates of Saint Peter. I really hate it. It\u2019s one of my biggest fears. I fear death.\n\nI know that no one can fucking tell when someone is going to die, so there\u2019s no point in living in fear. But even so there\u2019s still that tiny voice in the back of my head that\u2019s nagging me to no end. I also fear forgetting how to breath. That one especially sucks during the night. Just nagging at me, giving me trouble to sleep.\n\nThere are various reason I have this levels of anxiety (anxiety disorder). Mainly because of the time I got hit by a car (I\u2019m not joking) 2 years ago. It\u2019s like, got hit by a car and god said, \u201cboom! You have anxiety now\u201d. And yeah, that\u2019s were my problems started; with that accident. I was fine, I literally got up right after I landed and walked to the sidewalk; only thing I had to show for it were: a small gash on my forehead,  a few bruises, and a sore neck. Sadly my skateboard didn\u2019t make it; it broke in half \ud83d\ude22. But I still fell asleep that night (after a mild breakdown of wondering if I was still alive), and woke up to go to school.\n\nTalking about that accident, there\u2019s another fear that I have thanks to it. And that is the fear tha I actually died in that accident. Thankfully it\u2019s not as big as my other fears and can easily dismiss it. It\u2019s still there tho; as tiny as it may be.\n\nMy anxiety also stems from other  stuff like: sadness due to personal loss (auntie died 5 days into 2021), fear of failing at school, and fear of disappointing my parents because of it. By no means am I dumb. Not to brag or anything, but I\u2019m smarter than average in some areas (*\u00b4\ua4b3`*). And one of those areas ain\u2019t math. I\u2019m a senior this year and math and English are the two things that are in danger of making me fail highschool. The pressure is so high because I also have to deal with college classes at the same time, and problems , and taking care of me sister (both parents work full time, cause you know, lower class). It\u2019s just too dam much man.\n\nI also fear the responsibilities that come with graduation. You see, actually nvm. Too much shit to type and explain. Case and point, I\u2019m a mess.

I'm scheduled for an appointment 2 weeks from now. In the meantime, I can only make this post.\n\nBasically, I ate a bad sandwich last weekend and was terribly sick afterwards, not being able to keep food down and facing malnutrition. This meant that my heartbeat was faster than usual, which did wonders for my stress and anxiety, which caused me to have a bit of a panic attack. For the next day or so, I felt horrible, being either too hot or too cold, mind fog, all of that stuff. \n\nI know I had these specific feelings before; one time was when I made a stupid mistake and ended up spending 2 days in a psych ward where no one really cared for me that much (to be fair, my case wasn't nearly as fatal as some of the other folks in there, but still, every bit of help counts, ya know?) The other time was last year, when Covid cases were getting pretty bad and being confined to the house started to stress me out.\n\nAny previous time I felt this same sort of thing, the symptoms gradually went away, and I can feel them going away as we speak. I'm not facing any chills or hot flashes, I'm eating and drinking plenty of water, my head is hurting a little bit less. I was very worried for a second that I am facing depersonalization, because there's still this very very minuscule sense of uneasiness in me. But I'm not too sure about that. I am still present and conscious, and I know very well what world I exist in, I can feel myself getting better and having these symptoms slow down.\n\nI'm just a bit confused, I guess, and wondering if anyone has dealt with a situation that's similar to mine right now. One of the things I used to use to help my anxiety was to use THC, whether it be in wax carts or weed. At the moment, I'm using a pen. I made sure *not* to use it over the past few days when my anxiety was through the roof. Once I was calm, I tried it, and felt relaxed. The next time, I got too anxious, and had to eat something so I could lose the high and calm myself. The time after that was even more odd, because I didn't feel any buzz.\n\nCaffeine is another factor. I'm mostly choosing water throughout the day, but earlier this morning I chose an iced coffee, mostly because I woke up feeling refreshed and level-headed. You know what? It didn't cause any problems. I felt fine. But just now, I decided to take a small can of soda, and could my heartbeat getting fast again after drinking some of it. \n\nI know a lot of the stuff going on right now, and is probably just in my head. My best hope is that I just cut these things off a little more and wait until I feel that I'm actually ready to handle them again. But, there's another part of me that worries this is permanent.

My fuse is very short and I am irritated easily. I am emotionless and more like zombie. This accompanied by the fantastic slew of doom based thoughts. It is a wonderful rollercoaster of joy. I do have my fun times that are really when my mind is distracted. None of is a great time.\n\nThen comes the medical marijuana. Oh the joys of nature\u2019s fun plant.

I told myself, \u201cI should hydrate properly in preparation,\u201d because I\u2019ve read that may help reduce a strong immune response, and then, in the days following that choice, I proceeded to become TERRIBLE at drinking water. I mostly drink tea nowadays. Haven\u2019t gotten my second dose since there\u2019s no pop-up clinic being set up in my (tiny) hometown), but I know that once a date is set for it, drinking water will go from being Difficult to Downright Impossible. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a mental block in my mind preventing me from doing so\u2026\n\nAnother example: work. I\u2019m a casual worker in my hometown\u2019s grocery store, and I took a short break after I got an anxiety attack a few hours into my shift. Once I recovered from the few days\u2019 anxiety episode, I told myself, \u201cI want to go back to work eventually so I can save money,\u201d because a friend and I have plans to take a trip to the nearby city, and I want to meet up with a close internet friend of mine who I\u2019ve known for a few years now.\n\nGuess what? I haven\u2019t gone back!!! It\u2019s so hard. With every day that passed with me not going, I got more and more morose, until I woke up one day and nothing felt *right*, like I was on the edge of something. I could not relax. I could barely eat. The morning afterwards I realized that it was going to be a horrible day if I didn\u2019t *think thoroughly* about what was stressing me out, so I did: I realized I was thinking too much about work, too much about the trip, and placing *way* too much pressure on myself to conform to my own set-upon standards. \n\nI eventually assured myself (with help from my Mom) that I didn\u2019t have to force myself to do things if I didn\u2019t feel ready. *And that helped so much*. Seriously, I cannot believe how effective it was. I felt like a tentative version of my usual anxiety-free self. Turns out repressing your worries is a pretty shitty way of coping.\n\nSo I gradually stopped putting pressure on myself, telling myself, *you don\u2019t have to if you\u2019re not ready*, and I realized - I *do* want to do things again. I want to get my second dose, so I can go to city and get fucking slutty with my friends!!! But I\u2019m still struggling with hydration, and the thought of working again exhausts me, and my anxiety hangover\u2019s clinging to me; I\u2019ve had a couple attacks this past week, which I\u2019ve dealt with varying degrees of success. \n\nI\u2019m still a bit scared, and I don\u2019t know how to take that first step.

It truly feels like, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care anymore, which is not me. I don\u2019t have any plans for after Uni, I\u2019m gonna study painting and I\u2019ll probably starve after and if I finish it. It\u2019s 2 AM and I\u2019ve spent my entire day listening to my heart and checking for all kinds of signs. I don\u2019t want to die. I don\u2019t want to\u2026but it\u2019s not in my hands and if I try to detach from this thought I just get more depressed. I\u2019ll move out soon, I\u2019m gonna be sad, my parents still treat me like a little kid and they\u2019re going to be crushed. My brother killed himself almost 7 years ago. I feel like I can\u2019t be honest with my friends anymore. I\u2019ll see a cardiologist soon. I had a brain MRI a few months ago cause I thought I was going to die, came back clear. The thought calms me but at the same time I feel like the Universe is going to turn its back at me and laugh. I feel like it\u2019s serious this time. I don\u2019t like most people and I don\u2019t have that things that makes people like me, or at least I have something that makes them not like me. Am I overthinking again? I just want concrete certainty for once. Someday I\u2019ll be old and will make films. I\u2019m watching a documentary that makes no sense. I\u2019ll probably always be alone.

She also asked if I was spiritual and suggested some spiritual podcasts and books even after I told her I wasn't. Also told me I should avoid gluten and do breathing exercises. This didn't sit too well with me but hey I'm not a doctor so I'm going to try it.  \n\n\nI've read the side effects of mirtazapine and they don't sound great.

I want to share because this is rly fucking me up\n\nIve never really had a partner. Over the course of the lockdown (and for most of my life in general) many of my depressive episodes were at least partially rooted in this fact. The idea of having an intimate and emotionally supportive relationship is super appealing, and almost seemed like it would end most of my problems. But more importantly, it seemed like it would be very validating. Being a man who is going into young adulthood and never having a relationship feels really shitty. Id be ashamed to even reveal it to others. This a a really toxic thought process; I know I shouldnt place so much of my self worth on success with girls. But its such a strong guttural feeling.\n\nAs such, throughout the lockdown I was constantly hyping myself up, swearing that as soon as school starts id be super proactive with trying to finally achieve this. I was imagining myself as this social butterfly trying to make up for all the lost time of the pandemic and living the stereotypical life of a young social person.\n\nNow that time has come. Ive been back in school for a few months now, and surprisingly, I literally have a girl pursuing me who asked me on a date. I said yes, but my feelings about everything are super weird and conflicted. i believe a lot of it stems from my social anxiety. Despite how badly I wanted something exactly like  this to happen, confronting it is super scary and overwhelming. Im not even really looking forward to it, because its such a big departure from my normal antisocial routine. When I had her texting me all day, I realized that I really might not be ready for the expectations and comittments of a relationship. I can barely muster the energy to text back. There really shouldnt be any reason for me to feel so bad about it all, theres really nothing wrong with her and like I said, my mindset during the lockdown wasnt a super picky one; I really was committed to finding someone. I would feel validated from it. This is my chance to finally get some amount of experience with dating. of course my male friends have been telling me im an idiot for not immediately trying to get laid with her.

Intense delirium. The kind you get when super sick with a fever, except much worse. \n\nIt was the very first night I was there, about 11 o\u2019 clock Ish so not very late and I had slept relatively fine the previous night. (I would like to mention a lot of my anxiety is related to my stomach and I have a very hard time eating under stress, so I had barely eaten the whole day.) I got into bed, very nauseous which wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary and that\u2019s when I began having my issue. It wasn\u2019t something sudden that noticeably happened, I more so just weened into the mindset. In short, the whole world became tinted a navy blue, smoke filled up the room and it was as if there was a filter put over my vision of cobwebs, but they weren\u2019t necessarily cobwebs. I remember interpreting them at the time as plant roots that completely filled up the room from floor to ceiling, but thinking back on it they looked much more like dense cobwebs. On top of all this, I was also convinced my cousin was a drug dealer, and that I was going to be forced into the cocaine business the very next day.\n\nThe next morning I felt like absolute shit. This isn\u2019t necessarily out of the ordinary because I do often get morning sickness, even when not anxious and in my own home. Usually it dissipates by noon and I\u2019m completely fine for the rest of the day, which is exactly how said day went. The nausea was gone by noon and the day went completely normal afterwords. However, I had one more night to spend. And once again, I experienced the exact same thing. Smoke, vines, cobwebs, whatever they were filling up the room and only inches from my face, and the horrible fear that people were in the house watching me and waiting to kill me. The next morning I visited the beach, continued to pack my stuff up and get the hell out. I\u2019ve never experienced it since and have never experienced it before, coming from someone who\u2019s had very severe anxiety since kindergarten and have been in much more stressful situations than a simple weekend vacation to visit family.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this?

It started in college,on a dating app, then got serious after he struggled with his health and I had to make a decision to get invested quickly. The first few months were wonderful, then I think we settled into a routine and started really living together, then I found him getting on my nerves more.  \n And ever since 6 months ago, I've been having doubts about our relationship. I haven't felt like having sex, it makes me uncomfortable when before I would enjoy and initiate it.  I've been keeping my distance and growing reclusive into books and games instead of communicating. When I try to go on dates or figure out something fun to do it all feels forced.  Little things he does, like yelling at video games, or asking for sex, have annoyed me and even made me angry and I don't know why, but he thinks everything is fine.  I've been thinking, probably because of all the media I've been consuming in the last few months, but I feel like, were the world ending, or if something were to happen with my partner and I, it wouldn't feel like, well, anything. It wouldn't feel like there was a risk, or I was losing someone I couldn't possibly part with. And that has started to scare me into thinking, maybe the relationship has run it's course. I had this realization in the middle of the store with him today and it made me feel like I was floating through jello. It was miserable.\n\nI am also moving for school in less than a week now. Like in two days. Its going to be far enough we won't see each other for a while. Its been weighing on me. Now when I'm in therapy for my anxiety what comes up most is just not feeling free, feeling trapped,like I'm not living up to my potential, but also feeling like if I were to uproot my life I'd have no safety net. I don't have many friends outside his friends and siblings, and my parents also love my partner so much. If things were to end, I'd have no one. Especially since I'm moving away and won't know anyone. \ni don't know what to do. It isn't as though my partner isn't kind and a good person. I've loved him but I feel completely closed off. I don't want to hurt him. But I'm worried this is a life transition we can't last through. And the worst part is he asks me about things like getting married, moving with me after he finishes school here, being together forever, and while I liked the idea at first now I'm worried I can't handle it, and I don't know how to break it to him, or when. We live together until I move, but it's such a short time period that were I to decide to end it now I'd have to stay here for two days. But am I to wait, I'm an asshole who led him on. Or this could all be the anxiety and stress of knowing everything in my life is changing all at once affecting my thinking, and everything will feel better once I move.

Every now and then, while browsing those websites, or while on Deviantart, I'll come across content that sexualizes underage characters. That content never involves photos of actual people (it's just written stories, drawings, and CGI images), and so it's unclear to me whether or not such content actually violates any laws. But it's obviously an unsettling thing to see. I'm prone to severe anxiety, and so when I see content like this, it really rattles me. In a handful of instances, I decided to anonymously report the content to law enforcement through WeTip. In each of those reports, I explicitly stated that I wasn't sure about the actual legal status of the content and was only filing the report out of an abundance of caution.\n\nI've also filed a number of WeTip reports about pornographic photos I've seen on Reddit and Pinterest, featuring women who look like they could potentially be underage. The women in those photos aren't identified, and so I don't actually know how old they are. Most likely, they're somewhere around 18 - 20, but because they look like they \\*could\\* be a few years younger than that, I get overwhelmed with anxiety and feel like I have to inform law enforcement just in case. I realize that this probably isn't the correct approach, but I just haven't known what to do in these situations. I doubt that any of the photos I've reported actually depict anyone underage, and when filing each of these reports, I've always explained that I don't know the actual age of the women in the photos.\n\nAround the beginning of the year, I reported a story on a small erotica website, and about a week after filing that report, I noticed a security alert on my laptop from my anti-virus software, informing me that a network attack had been blocked. I'm not tech savvy at all, and so anything having to do with cyber-security goes way over my head. From what I could figure out, the alert was most likely a false positive, caused by my laptop connecting to a relative's router for the first time. But I started worrying about the possibility that the person who I reported may have somehow figured out my IP address and tried to hack into my computer as a way of getting back at me.\n\nA few months later, I reported a story on Deviantart to WeTip, and one or two days after that, I got an email notification that someone had requested to reset my Deviantart password. The request had been made in the middle of the night, while I was sleeping. I had never posted anything from my Deviantart account and had actually deactivated the account months prior to this happening. So I was really startled to see that email! I had thought that by deactivating my account, the account would be deleted, but apparently, Deviantart doesn't fully delete accounts; deactivation simply means that an account can't be used anymore, but the account still exists, and it's still possible to log into a Deviantart account that's been deactivated.\n\nAlthough it's certainly possible that someone with a similar username was trying to log into their account and simply entered my username by mistake, the timing made me worry again that someone was trying to hack me in response to a report that I had filed.\n\nA month or so after that, I started getting multiple phishing emails almost every day. I'm still getting these emails, and they often make it past my spam filter into my regular inbox. They'll claim to be from reputable companies, like Costco or CVS, but are sent from addresses that clearly aren't associated with those companies.\n\nRecently, I noticed that my email's account activity page lists multiple instances of people trying to hack into my account. Each of those attempts were listed as \"unsuccessful\", but learning that people were trying to hack my email is only making me more paranoid. Also - my phone has an app called Digital Secure, which lists \"46 threats found so far\", but doesn't actually explain what those threats are. I assume that they're just a list of the public wi-fi networks my phone has connected to throughout the year, but I really have no idea. \n\nOne other weird thing happened recently :  I noticed a text message that had been sent \\*from\\* my phone saying that Google was re-verifying my phone number. I've looked this up, and it's a legitimate thing that Google does, but I haven't been able to figure out what prompted Google to do this. So it's just one more thing making me worried about cyber-security.\n\nAgain, I realize that filing a bunch of reports about things that probably aren't even illegal was almost definitely a mistake on my part. I wanted to ask a therapist about what I should do when I see stuff online that concerns me, but I wasn't in therapy when covid happened, and the pandemic has made it really hard to start seeing someone. At first, when I came across questionable stuff online, I tried to just ignore and forget about it, but I started to feel guilty about doing that and convinced myself that I had a responsibility to pass along anything that concerned me to someone more qualified to evaluate it. In each case, I assumed that law enforcement would simply glance at what I had reported, determine that it wasn't worth investigating, and move on. But I felt like I needed to pass the responsibility to make that determination on to someone else; otherwise, I would never stop worrying about it.\n\nIn addition to general anxiety disorder, I'm pretty sure that I've long had undiagnosed OCD. And I've had periods of irrational paranoia about a number of different things in the past. I realize that lots of people are targeted randomly by hackers and how unlikely it is that the any of the people I reported are actually coming after me. But I've never had serious issues with cyber-security in the past, and so the timing of everything - especially the deviantart thing - has made it easy for me to jump to conclusions. I've had so many weird cyber-security alerts accumulating over the last several months, and I don't understand any of them. So each one has just added to my anxiety. \n\nEven if I am just being paranoid about the cyber security alerts, I'm still not completely sure what I should be doing when I see questionable stuff online. I've tried to stop filing reports - I've already filed dozens, and even though they've all been anonymous, I'm worried that law enforcement will notice that they've all been coming from the same person, in which case they might wrongly assume that I've been intentionally seeking this kind of stuff out. I really wish I had found a therapist to speak to about these concerns before they got so far out of hand.  \n\nNot really sure what kind of response I'm looking for. I just needed to get this off my chest I guess. Sorry it's so long. I keep convincing myself that I'm just being paranoid, but then I keep noticing more cyber-security issues and my anxiety gets triggered again. \n\nTLDR: Filed a bunch of anonymous reports to law enforcement about stuff that probably isn't even illegal, and now every time I notice a cyber-security issue, I'm worried that any of the people I reported could be targeting me.", "title": "Paranoid after reporting online content to law enforcement (possible trigger warning)"}, {"created_utc": 1624466016, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o6gfws/carbonated_water_hr_anxiety_trigger/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "Anyone\u2019s Heart Rate anxiety tripped by drinking non-caffeinated carbonated drinks?

I am probably just venting, but all advice is appreciated.\n\nWhat in the world are nocturnal panic attacks? They're really starting to screw up my sleep!\n\nOur weather here has hit over 100F, and living on the fourth floor of a building with no A/C, fans that don't help, shit gets hot around here! Our average non-summer day rests between 60-70F. As we started to climb into the triple digits, I noticed I've started having panic attacks while I sleep. They don't wake me up, but I'm drenched by the time my alarm goes off. Mayo calls them \"Nocturnal Panic Attacks\" or \"Nocturnal Anxiety\" but that sounds like a fancy way of telling me I just need some help.\n\nI tried changing my blankets to something lighter, but now there isn't enough weight for me to sleep. Tried using one of our weighted blankets, but due to the weight, I'm having to fully wake up just to roll over, which causes its own brand of problems. So now I've got myself a loose crocheted blanket under another thin-ish blanket so I can peel off layers, but instead of getting any sleep I'm sweating my ass off and freezing.\n\nMy brain is telling me it has nothing to do with the heat. I'm waking up with my heart racing, sweaty and cold, and panicked. We have quite a lot going on in our lives here at home right now, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that I am, in fact, running a marathon in my sleep. But why is this only just now happening as it's getting hotter?\n\nI don't really care about the why's, although I'm curious. Everywhere I look tells me the solution is therapy or medication. This doesn't seem to be an option for me - my last two therapists have dumped me citing too complex of a case (so now I'm afraid to try again), and the last three doctors I spoke to said they are unwilling to prescribe me any medication to help and refer me to talk therapy. I have not been able to find an out-patient psychiatrist who is willing to look beyond their dosage and actually check in with how I'm doing or listen to me when I tell them the medication is making me suicidal. I feel stuck with these problems because doctors would rather laugh at me when I ask for medication than listen and find ways to help me. I've filed exactly two formal complaints in the last 5 years over doctors actually laughing when I ask for help. I just don't understand what it's going to take to get any relief. I don't even take Advil at home; what's there to laugh at?\n\nI had an active prescription for Xanax prior to moving to where I am now. I had to re-establish care in my new state and the new psychiatrist laughed when I asked her to continue my current prescriptions.

I asked for migraine meds to combat my 20+ days a month stuck in bed and they give me 9 pills for 60 days that don't work, and shrug when I ask to try something new. Ten doctors and five years later, I am now a massive ball of anxiety without the only things that helped me in the past.\n\nI'm desperate for some relief at this point. Why is it that therapy and medication have to be the only solutions to this? I live in a healthy environment, I'm in a healthy relationship, everyone hates their job so that's normal...

In my early 20's, I was diagnosed with moderate depression, and went on a carousel of Lexapro, Celexa, and Wellbutrin (in that order) over a few years, all on entry-level dosages (I never met with a psychiatrist during this time, just worked with my GP, and would talk to my therapist). Eventually, I landed on not wanting to be on meds due to the side effects (mostly sexual except WB), and feeling like they weren't \"helping\" (whatever I thought that was supposed to mean at the time). I decided to put a lot of emphasis on diet, exercise, and getting more sleep, which has helped some, and I just chalked the rest of my \"off-ness\" to genetics/learned behaviors that I keep trying to tackle in therapy.\n\nI'm in my late 30's now, and in April I checked myself into the hospital (per the advice of my wife and my therapist) with thoughts of suicide , and at the end of a 2-day hold, met with a psychiatrist for the first time and was diagnosed with MMD and GAD, and was prescribed 20 mg of Paxil.   I had never previously been diagnosed with anxiety, but it's always been something that has sat in the back of my mind (I've watched my mom struggle with it for years).  The psychiatrist also explained to me that one of the reasons the other meds may not have felt like they were working is because I likely wasn't on a high-enough dose (seems obvious enough, just not something I was ever told). The side effects from Paxil showed up as they did with the other meds in the past (even worse-so at the higher dose), but as we got close to 4-5 weeks, it was like everything clicked. My depression and anxiety had been subsiding along the way, but it was like my anxiety was non-existent at that moment. This is the first time in my life I've ever felt this way for this long, and was able to tap into everything that felt like healtheir behavors with ease (no obsessive thoughts, letting things roll of my shoulders, etc). Best two weeks of my brain I've ever had.\n\nAt that point, now that we knew something worked for me, my wife and I talked about the sexual side effects, and I worked with my psychiatrist to look at other options. He put me on Viibryd, and carefully tapered me off of the Paxil (which was still rough, and I wouldn't wish that on anybody). We worked up to 20mgs of Viibryd, and I've now been on that dosage for just around 4 weeks. The sexual side effects have gone away completely, and the depression is mostly non-existent. The issue, however, is with my anxiety.\n\nIt's like I'm back to where I was before I was on medication again. The obsessive thoughts are there, I get thrown off really easily, and I just start looping (or \"going up the branches\" is how I think about it sometimes). I've tried to understand Viibryd through conversations with my psychiatrist and reading online, but I'm definitely not feeling like the results are showing up much (sometimes not even a little). I recognize it may take more time before I notice any benefit, or may need to go on a higher dosage/combo it with another medication.  I also recognize Paxil can stay in your system for a while, which may be contributing to my anxiety.\n\nWhat advice do people have that could give me some perspective? I finally had peace in my brain for a short window of time, and I'm worried I may just have to live without that (or with some very frustrating side-effects), which is, in itself, a bit depressing :).", "title": "Your experience with Viibryd helping anxiety"}, {"created_utc": 1624461236, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o6etwt/the_best_calming_soothing_relaxation_sleep_music/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "THE BEST Calming soothing relaxation sleep music"}, {"created_utc": 1624461057, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o6errc/5_shifts_to_eliminate_negative_emotions_and/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "5 Shifts to Eliminate Negative Emotions and Limiting Beliefs Caused by Depression"}, {"created_utc": 1624460515, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o6el2v/ive_done_so_much_lately/", "num_comments": 7, "score": 1, "selftext": "I know this is like.. really not that special in the grand scheme of things but I'm just so glad I managed to do these.\n\nI drove a car.

Then heart palpitations, tightness of the chest, pressure in the head. And the main symptom a Lightheadedness in the head.

Never get sick and she\u2019s in shape. Eats right and takes care of her self. But throughout the eight years of us being together every six months or so she suffers from panic attacks. They come out of nowhere and they\u2019re gone. Also my wife has anxiety. She tends to worry, and stress about things that the average person wouldn\u2019t. Also she has obsessive personality traits. \nSo throughout the three months My wife has went to the ER multiple times for this feeling, our PCP, An ENT doctor. A neurologist, and a physical therapist. We received no definitive answers on what could be the cause of her symptoms.

Learned to drive in a busy city and I actually enjoy it most of the time. But I'm a cautious driver. I was taught to always expect other people to make mistakes. So I mostly stick to the speed limit, go slower when the view is obstructed, keep away from other cars and such. It's a running joke between my friends that I'm the worst driver around, but it's not true. They just drive more recklessly which I find rather stupid.\n\nIn my country, traffic is well regulated. Roads are maintained and speed limits enforced by police. We have many, often complicated rules, but most people abide by them. When I drive here, I feel secure. Not necessarily because I know the way well, but because there's an inherit trust that the roads are safe and traffic is regulated at all times. There's no need to worry too much. I do get somewhat anxious if I'm in an unfamiliar city with loads of traffic and I don't know the way, but it's not the same kind of crippling anxiety that I get when I drive across the border.\n\nNow, I love our neighboring country. They have beautiful nature, lovely people, and amazing food. What they don't have are safe roads or regulated traffic. They don't even have traffic signs in most parts. The locals somehow manage to navigate without drama, but they grew up there. I didn't. And I've gotten so scared of their roads that I now try to avoid driving there altogether. \n\nMy major issues are\n\n\\- there are no signs. You rarely know the speed limit but usually there really isn't one. Everyone can drive as fast as they want, but if you go too slow, people will rage which stresses me out a lot. You never know what's too fast or too slow. \n\n\\- the roads are not maintained. They are usually incredibly damaged so you risk breaking your car on some parts. There's flooding (and of course no signs warning you about it), giant potholes, sinkholes, fallen trees, mudslides, rocks falling. Sometimes roads just end without warning. I've nearly driven off a cliff more than once. Sometimes there's a sudden dead end after you drove 20 miles. No sign telling you so. In my country stuff like this is extremely rare. It doesn't really happen and if it does, road workers treat it as an emergency and roads will only be reopened once safe to drive. If there's a road, it's safe to drive. Across the border, this isn't the case. \n\n\\- people rarely follow traffic rules or common sense. This is great if you have the confidence to follow their example, but less great if you are a worrier. Every time I drive across the border, I get into so many near accidents. I might try to follow some sort of traffic rules, but if no one else does, well. I know the best strategy is to follow the flow and not stick to rigid rules in situations like this, but everything is happening too fast for me to \"just follow\". \n\nI feel like most of my anxiety related to driving across the border isn't actually unfounded. The roads aren't safe. That's a fact. But millions of people use them every day without shitting their pants, no? And I doubt any of the locals ever nearly drive off a cliff. So it shouldn't be so much of a problem for me. And I think another large part is that I don't speak the language well enough. I always learn more and more, but if there are signs warning of danger ahead they are usually too complicated for me to read (walls of small text).

I've always considered myself an intersectional feminist, but I feel as though I'm a bad person who has done something irrevocably bad, and has betrayed women everywhere (which I know is overreacting).\n\nI have Asperger's Syndrome, as well as clinical depression and at the time the events below happened, I was wrestling with what I later that same month realised was an aggressive form of OCD caused by extreme anxiety and stress, (with general OCD being something I Iater realised I've always had). \n\nAround this time, due to an increasingly non-existent libido, I began to suspect that I was, indeed, asexual. I can't really explain my attitude towards women in any other way than to say I've never sexualised women really; while I sincerely respect a woman's sexuality (or lack thereof), my most enriching relationships with women have always been wholly platonic, and non-sexual. \n\nAt first, in 2020, I assumed this was just an over-reaction to the stress of experiencing sex and overthinking things, but now I realise that (irrespective of whether I'm on anti-anxiety medication or not), I seriously don't desire romantic or sexual relationships. The world of sex and its cybercommunities are too confusing and boring for me (no offence), and I just don't feel drawn to them whatsoever. \n\n1.) One morning last May, I woke up in an uncharacteristically 'horny' state and didn't want to relieve myself because I knew that this fleeting, uncommon feeling would go away soon. \n\nAt the same time, I also felt I'd like to just vent the feeling somewhere, but my OCD anxiety had conditioned me by this point of 2020 to avoid doing anything 'traditionally', as it were, lest I received intrusive thoughts. \n\nAlso, I didn't want to watch pornography because I've always hated the artificiality of it, and felt (due to my perhaps too-rigidly fixed moral compass) that \"a feminist doesn't watch porn!\" (which is just my view, personally, but every time I'd watch even a second of a clip, I'd feel unreasonably guilty, thinking, \"this is somebody's daughter!\").\n\nIn the end, faced with \"no other options\" (as far as my OCD was concerned), I messaged a text to a woman who I'd been friendly with for nearly a week at this point.\n\nI didn't even do this for gratification, it was simply to get rid of a feeling. I quickly unconsciously rationalised it as, \"Well, I think this is okay because she called me cute, and generally in the past, that's meant that someone's been flirting with you, but you were too aloof to clock the behaviour, and someone would have to tell you after the fact\". \n\nAfter falling asleep and waking up some time later, the fleeting feeling of randiness had of course gone, and so I thought, \"What an impulsive thing to do, that's unlike me, and regardless of what she responds with, I'll make amends by U-turning and moving the conversation forward onto a separate topic\". \n\nShe responded, not knowing what the abbreviation I had used meant, and so I said \"nevermind\" and we carried on talking as normal and I realised that that was a silly thing to do due to the fact that I deep-down didn't want to be sexual with her or any lady, as stated prior. And so, since I didn't really mean it, to myself, I didn't worry about it. In my mind, I'd wised up way before dire repercussions would start, and had done the adult thing. \n\nAbout 12 hours later, after our conversation had all but died, due to an exhaustion of conversation points, she blocked me. I remembered this last month when reading a MeToo article, and went out of my way to apologise via a new Snapchat account, but I still feel like a bad person.\n\nAt the same time, my lady friends have counseled me on the matter, saying \"If you'd sent a dick pic, (which I've never, ever sent unsolicited, or to a young person) that'd be sexist, but this is just an awkward moment, we've all done it, you didn't mean anything by it\", and other similar sentiments. \n\nAnother friend said, \"Bab, the amount of times I've misread a situation and said something sexual and then realised that the person wasn't feeling this, is a lot. Don't worry about it\". Another friend said, \"You're amazing for having apologised, but honestly, it's all good\". \n\nAlso, this has happened to me with the roles reversed, where an acquaintance of mine messaged me, saying \"I miss being choked\", with a Snapchat video of her neck (out of the blue) and I think maybe I'm overreacting due to the moral scrupulousness of my personality, in that I'm holding myself up to a higher moral standard than everybody else.\n\nHell, my best friend once messaged me when she was drunk, asking me what ahem, \"(p-word) tasted like\". \n\nIn truth, what both of my friends here did doesn't in the slightest constitute being a 'misandrist' (to flip the loaded, judgmental language of my OCD's finger-wagging) of course, they were just doing a spontaneous thing and they don't need to feel bad. \n\nIn a similar vein, I'm not a misogynist, and don't need to feel bad, right?\n\n2.) In mid-July, while depressed and once again in an unusually 'horny' state, I re-added a woman who I'd been speaking with on-and-off as friends (mainly, despite some consensual sexting, initially) for a year and a half, and I messaged her a text message that was sexual.\n\nIn this instance, I remembered the above encounter, and double-checked in my mind that we'd been flirting recently (non-commitally), which we had, but prior to me messaging her, two weeks prior, I'd said I didn't think it was a good idea for us to talk anymore as I felt we had nothing to talk about, which she accepted and I disappeared.\n\nAfter sending the sexual message, about two weeks after we'd last spoken, I was confident this was okay, as I'd not misundertood the tone, and I thought the tone of a conversation would still be there, even after one person disappears (as usually that's how conversations have worked previously with people I've known).\n\nAfter I said this, she said \"Nice\" (which I thought of as a good, \"Nice\"), but then she said \"Why did you think that'd be the first thing I'd want to see?\", so having realised I'd messed up the timing, I awkwardly receded then after talking to myself out loud about it, I apologised to her, and she said, \"Don't worry, it's okay\". \n\nEverything was fine until I remembered this last month and felt indebted to apologise (again) and she accepted it and I was overthinking by this point, and so said, \"I didn't traumatise you, did I?\"\n\nShe responded with a shrugged emoji, and then I said, \"Well, I hope I didn't\", and she said, \"Oh well\", and I said, \"What do you mean?\" and she said, \"Never mind\". I think she was being sarcastic here, and I think she got annoyed that I didn't get it and became further annoyed at how I continually kept apologising after this point, and then she blocked me. \n\nI then felt even worse and then re-added her via my secondary Snapchat account in order to apologise, and she saw the message and saved it and that's it.\n\nMy friend pointed out to me that she more than likely meant no ill-will by blocking me, but she probably felt like I wasn't listening to her accepting my apologies, and maybe felt annoyed that I was continually apologising for something so incredibly minor.\n\nI've now realised that I am totally asexual, which is totally unsurprising. \n\nSo, that's it. I don't want to go on living if I've done something awful to these women (which is just catastrophizing, I know), but at the same time, the rational part of my brain is saying,\n\n \"BRO, IT WAS AN AWKWARD MOMENT THAT YOU CORRECTED IN BOTH CASES, BOTH AT THE TIME AND LATER, AND IT WASN'T SOMETHING YOU DID OUT OF ENTITLEMENT OR SEXISM -\n\nMISUNDERSTANDING THESE NUANCES HAPPENS TO NEUROTYPICALS AND 'ASPIES' ALIKE, AND IT'S LITERALLY A HALLMARK CHARACTERISTIC OF YOUR CONDITION. CHILL, YOU'RE NOT HARVEY WEINSTEIN OR BILL COSBY\".\n\nI've been unable to sleep peacefully for the last three weeks due to a Gordian knot of anxiety in my stomach, but I've tried to calm my myself down by saying that I did the digital equivalent of approaching a woman in a nightclub after she'd maybe been smiling at me, and then I end up making a blunder, or vice versa. \n\n\nWhat do you think?", "title": "Did I do something wrong?

Really it all chalks down to our \u201cnerves being sensitized\u201d or \u201cstress response hyperstimulation.\u201d\n\nWe all know that stress is a natural part of life. It comes from all kinds of things and our bodies are adequately equipped to handle it. Whenever our body is stressed it activates the \u201cstress response\u201d or \u201cfight or flight.\u201d When these responses are activated infrequently, our bodies bounce back quite quickly. However, for people with persistent anxiety, our body can\u2019t bounce back right away.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nThere is a first-degree stress response and a second-degree stress response that is important in understanding how our body works. Our body controls the degree of the stress response based on the perceived danger \u2013 a mild threat triggers a low degree stress response whereas a bigger threat triggers a bigger one. So, to accommodate these different degrees, our body has two stages.\n\nIf it is a mild threat it usually only triggers the first-degree response. The first-degree stress response secretes first-degree stress hormones: mainly adrenaline and noradrenaline. The purpose of this response is to be fast and get us out of harm's way immediately, sometimes even before we have time to fully process the risk. When this subsides, we go back to pre-danger homeostasis.\n\nBut then there is a second-degree stress response. If the perceived threat is grave and last more than a minute the body produces the second-degree response \u2013 primarily cortisol. Like with the first-degree, once the danger or stressor has passed our body stops secreting cortisol. So, when the stress response occurs infrequently, our body can recover from it quite quickly.\n\nHowever, when we\u2019ve been struggling with an anxiety disorder for weeks, months, or years, the more dramatic and sustained the response is and the longer it takes for the body to recover. This is because our body keeps triggering cortisol until it has determined the danger/stressor has passed. So, our body is constantly pumping cortisol and it remains in a \u201csensitized state.\u201d Remember: stress hormones are stimulants, so it impacts us greatly.\n\nCortisol is actually the main reason why many people struggle with an anxiety disorder. Adrenaline is a short-acting stimulant whereas cortisol brings about profound physiological, cognitive, and emotional changes. Adrenaline does play a role, but it is minor compared to cortisol. Therefore, it is this persistent and higher than normal levels of cortisol in our bloodstream that is causing our problem.\n\nSo, in the image I have attached the black shows what a normal cortisol rhythm looks like in our body. Our body likes a regular pattern so it can replicate them the next day as part of the homeostasis process. This is what we know as our circadian rhythm. Our cortisol levels fluctuate in the day in response to what our body thinks is a normal cortisol pattern AND in response to how we behave. When the body is not overly stressed, we have normal cortisol levels and spikes in cortisol do not cause any sensations and symptoms. For example, coffee spikes cortisol. When you weren\u2019t anxious you could enjoy it no problem because your levels were normal but since our levels are persistently elevated we feel it 10x more.\n\nIf you look at the other purple line, this is what happens when we add stress to our day. The body then learns that pattern and works to maintain it due to homeostasis. As we continue to worry and not give our bodies a break, it then goes to the blue lines. Remember the more we worry the more cortisol the body produces. So if we are doing the five F\u2019s of our anxiety symptoms (fearing, fighting, fixing, focusing, and getting frustrated) and not accepting/allowing, our body is going to keep producing cortisol. The blue line is what the cortisol patterns might look like after many months of major worry (like we typically are after dealing with anxiety for \u201cX\u201d number of months or years).\n\nSo anxious behaviour teaches our body to learn higher levels of cortisol as the new \u201cnormal\u201d cortisol pattern and then replicates it every day. The more the cortisol rises the more our symptoms do. These persistently elevated levels of cortisol will cause our bodies to become persistently stimulated or our nerves to be \u201csensitized\u201d EVEN IF we are no longer anxious or feel anxious.\n\nThat answers the question as to why we get symptoms even when we\u2019re no longer anxious. But the other question has to do with recovery time.\n\nThese cortisol levels can also explain this. Since our bodies mimic the cortisol levels to maintain homeostasis it can\u2019t just go down overnight. We have to stop activating the stress response (via acceptance) and give it plenty of time to go back to normal. Our bodies CAN do this when we stop producing the stress response. Brain plasticity science also has shown great findings around this and our brains can actually change itself and overcome challenges.\n\nSo instead of worrying about the \u201cWhat Ifs\u201d of all the anxiety symptoms that come from stress response hyperstimulation, focus on accepting and allowing to reduce our stress and give our body the ample time it needs to get back to normal.\n\nI hope that was helpful. It is a really science-y and complicated process, and it was even hard for me to try and type it out. Understanding this really helped me accept that recovery was going to take time and the importance of giving my body ample time to rest and recover via allowance and acceptance.", "title": "Answer to why does recovery take so long?

She seems to care about him, but doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019ll do anything herself. I feel really alone. Also, the last time I left him, I managed to break contact with him for a few days and planned to phone local emergency services if he sent me any messages that made me think he was in immediate danger, but my horrible anxiety makes me wonder if I could even manage that. I don\u2019t think I could ever forgive myself if he died and I did nothing.\n\nI feel a lot of guilt when he turns things I\u2019ve said to him in the past against me. Like, I told him I would love him forever and never leave him, and he asks if I was lying about all that when I try to leave. I didn\u2019t say it as a lie at the time, but my feelings have changed. He says he\u2019ll change and do whatever I want him to, and at the moment he\u2019s kept his word. He also says he needs me to live, can\u2019t live without me, etc. and it completely breaks my heart. But I still want to leave this relationship. I get anxiety thinking about having to live with him for the rest of my life too. He also doesn\u2019t want to seek help for his depression (which he had before he met me), but I think depression isn\u2019t very well treated in his country.\n\nSo please, if anyone have has any advice on what I can do to manage my anxiety in this situation I\u2019d greatly appreciate it.

I also included additional (optional) details at the end. \n\n\nI\u2019m a woman in her early 20s and have been seeing a guy pretty regularly the past 3 weeks. In total, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve spent about 17-18 hours together. I know it\u2019s still early on but he\u2019s expressed that he likes me multiple times (verbally and physically). Even during the first date, he was already asking me to let him know if I\u2019d be free a couple days from then. \n\nI recently took time to think and concluded I really do feel the same way. I told him. This was over text so I said I\u2019d elaborate the next time we we meet in person (due to other reasons we were unable to meet that day but I really had to get it off my chest). I know it sounds like middle school crush drama. I should be able to say \u201cI like you a lot too\u201d without being so nervous. But I hate saying things I don\u2019t mean, especially when it comes to emotions and feelings, which is why it took me longer to say it to him back. He is sick so he said he\u2019ll reply and express his feelings when we meet in person. \n\nMy mind is just running 10000 miles an hour. I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll tell me it was a nice thing to say, but that he doesn\u2019t see it going anywhere with me. Or that I\u2019ll be rejected in one way or another. \n\n\nAdditional details: \n\nI never really learned how to navigate relationships and my dating experience is more limited (I only started at 19). I grew up with an abusive childhood where we never said anything like that in my family and had a hard time trusting people when they constantly let me down. I\u2019m not trying to blame all my problems on my upbringing and I am working on them through therapy, but I do know it has greatly contributed to my anxiety and tendencies to withdraw when I feel threatened or think about worst case scenarios. I also grew up with barely any physical touch and thought for a long time that physical affection was uncomfortable for me, but through this, it turns out I\u2019m just highly selective. For the first time with someone, I enjoy our hugs/kisses and feel connected to him physically. \n\nEvery time we\u2019ve hung out, even if it\u2019s just on the couch, it\u2019s been at least 5 hours. Time flies and I genuinely my time with him. Our conversations are so fun, lively, and my anxiety is low around him. I also see a lot of green flags in him so far: he honors my boundaries, was there for me when I had something rough going on, reminds me that I\u2019m an amazing person who\u2019s accomplished lots for my age and has a good future, supports my ambitions, values communication, isn\u2019t afraid to talk about his own emotions/be vulnerable, and respects me as a person. He also supports himself on his own, has ambitions, and understands hard work. I guess the only thing is that he got out of a multi-year relationship in early 2020 that was toxic and bad for his mental health.

I\u2019ve been sober for a few years now because I finally realized that continuing to drink was a selfish act. But getting sober only intensified my distress over my past, since I no longer have my favorite medicine to numb my mind from the shame. I know that the more you recall an event, the less accurate your memory is of that event. I think I make myself into more of a monster every time I recall a certain memory. It\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s real anymore. \n\nI\u2019ve also been obsessing lately over something that happened in my professional life. I work for a nonprofit and was accused of trying to use funds from a coworker\u2019s program for my own \u2014something that I just straight-up did not do. The accusation had no evidence, just speculation and someone leaping jumping to extreme conclusions. I went through a whole formal process at work with my coworker and HR to resolve this. I have pretty strong evidence in my written communications that I did not do this thing (but it\u2019s so hard to prove a negative), and I offered to hand over all of my emails, slack messages, have my cell phone provider pull all my phone and text records to demonstrate that I did not do this thing, but my coworker has convinced themselves and refuses to listen. And they\u2019ve shared their accusation with others and I\u2019m worried that it will hurt my reputation and people\u2019s interest in working with me. I\u2019m also a little afraid of them. They\u2019ve harassed me and I\u2019m honestly a little worried they will show up to my house. \n\nBecause of all this, I can\u2019t stop thinking that the next bad thing is going to happen. That something bad will happen to me as karmic retribution for mistakes I\u2019ve made in the past, that maybe I deserved this false accusation at work\u2014not because I did this thing but because I\u2019ve been a bad person at other points in my life. That maybe I bring this all on myself. Things are going well for me now and I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop and for everything to be taken away from me. I intentionally trigger myself by visiting the social media pages of those I\u2019ve hurt or those who have hurt me, or just by replaying these past events in my head, thinking about how awful I am, and imagining how these things may come back to hurt me or my family in my present-day life. I do this almost as a ritual because there\u2019s a part of me that thinks as soon as I move on, that\u2019s when something will come back to bite me, or some new disaster will happen, and everything will crumble. Almost like I\u2019m protecting myself by replaying everything, going through every scenario and thinking it through from every angle. \n\nThere are some days when I feel right at the edge of suicide. I\u2019ve shared this with others but I\u2019m sick of feeling crazy or like a burden. Some days I convince myself that my child is better off without me, that I\u2019m a burden on my friends and my partner and my family. On these days, it feels like I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s real anymore.

The pain, the anxiety, the shortness of breath, the heart beating so hard it feels like its gonna come out of your chest. Ever since I was 15 I've had anxiety due to a traumatic up bringing,  alcohol father and sick bed ridden mother that was physically and emotionally abused by my father . My whole life I witnessed disfunction. I turned to drugs mostly opiates and pills and alcohol .. I think over time I made my anxiety worse . I finally got a hold on my drug use and got sober and got put on a antidepressant and it worked wonders for me as long as I stayed sober. I stayed sober off and on for years and until finally I decided I was at a point in my life where I was so happy and content I didn't need medication no more , I was exercising and holding a great job just got engaged and was as happy as I ever had been in a long time. I stayed away from negative friends and situations and concentrated on my health..until one day I decided to go off my medication , worst mistake of my life..I went into a deep depression and anxiety was worse then ever. I tried going back on it didn't work anymore. I tried several other medications nothing would fix my anxiety and triggered it more.. slowly the doctor decided to put me on a benzodiazapine it worked for a while and then it started making things worse. Now im withdrawling from it , my anxiety is so bad , I cant work, enjoy going places, spending time with my family or even think straight 24 7 its pure agony . I lost my mother in 2016 and now my father a few weeks ago and that devastated me even more..even though he was a alcoholic he was always there for me and improved over the years. Now I feel alone going through this total darkness, I just had a son at 36 a son I always prayed for and finally my fiance was able to give me one but now im too sick to enjoy him..my anxiety is so bad I couldn't even enjoy taking him to the zoo or park. And what hurts the most my fiance won't marry me like this , or doesn't even love me the same. All because of what medication and anxiety has done to my mind. I think about ending it everyday but I think of my son. But then I think what good am I to him like this..im scared to go places , I cant work like this I feel crippled from anxiety. Its so bad i see eye floaters and can't breath 24 7 . Alot of this is from the klotapin withdrawl. Im currently taking Celexa again , seroquel, suboxone was prescribed to help with the benzo withdrawls go figure and librium .. Nothing is really helping but the suboxone..I dont want to take anything anymore but I know im stuck on this shit probably forever until God takes me off and heals me. I dont know what to do I wish I could go off everything !!!! I hear stories of people recovering after years of healing but it being pure agony and i dont know how to function be a dad, work, and provide and I dont want to go disability!! My fiance isn't very supportive anymore because I been struggling for so long it has damaged us!! And that hurts alone!! I have no one to talk to that can relate hardly and im tired of suffering. I feel like taking my life. Because everyday is pure misery. I have everything and can't enjoy any of it because of my anxiety and depression!! My fiance is the total opposite and so happy going and I cant compete anymore with her. Im scared of loosing her , having to leave home and not have a place to live! Because I moved in with her..I just want her to understand and be supportive but its not in her. I have lost my self esteem and just dont care anymore. Nobody understands my story they tell me to man up get over it and I truly have a physical and mental illness now. I shake , have tremors, Agoraphobia,  and am so weak I can't do anything I use to be able to do.im constantly in a bad mood because my mind won't let me enjoy a moment of peace..I just dont know what to do anymore. I dont wanna be like this no more!!! Im tired of suffering. Im scare to wean off the drugs and scared to start new ones. I have two weeks to return back to work or I loose my job and then I know things will only get worse from there. But im scared I won't be able to do my job anymore because of my anxiety and withdrawls.im so lost. I just need someone to tell me i will get through this. But how? How do I stop meds while having to work? How do I provide to stop meds and heal? How do I function in society when im scared of my own shadow anymore. I just feel like giving up. I've tried rehabs , hospitals and even been trying to find a new doctor and everytime I explain my situation they think I want drugs but my doctor is the one who prescribed me them I never abused my medication and i was the one who checked myself in to get off. I should of tapered I guess but I was scared of doing it on the outside and having to function everyday . Now my brain is so messed up worse because of the benzos.

Because of this, my friendships have been a little wonky and my anxiety and insecurity around friendships has gotten a little worse. \n\nNoticed my roommate was getting closer to 2 other people from our group of 6 (which I have absolutely no problem with and completely understand-- I mean, I was out of the country for so long, it's only natural that they spend more time together and get closer). \n\nI asked her about it, \"hey, why don't you ever spend time with me like that, you don't really talk to me anymore.\" She tells me the most painful thing I've ever heard in my life (to sum up): \"our friendship is anxiety-ridden for me, in the last year I've noticed that I feel much better, before I'd feel anxious in groups and around you, now I realized that you are the one that makes me feel anxious since you haven't been around; for my own mental health I need to keep my distance from you.\" \n\nOf course, this hurt me a lot, the fact that I have made her suffer for this long and that my friendship was taking a toll on her, even though I haven't had any major depressive episodes after and have kept my healing process mostly to myself, she herself has said that I'm a much better person than I was 4 years ago.  She now wants to distance herself from me, she has reiterated that none of this is my fault and she does not know if she can change or it will change. I asked her if she could speak to somebody professionally about it, maybe it could help her, she says that she knows the problem and she knows how to deal with it so it's not necessary.\n\nI also asked if she'd be more comfortable if I moved out and she said she never thought about it that way but yes, it would make a difference. I don't want to move out though but if I feel like this environment is hostile for me I will have no choice. After this conversation she just smiled and acted like nothing happened.\n\nOf course she said more but it's too painful to bring up again. What should I do? How do I move on from this pain? None of this is anybody's fault but it hurts.\n\nHonestly, it felt like a breakup and I don't know what to do. Spent the night bawling in my room.

But um. Yea. My dads on my ass about money. My mom kicked me out for her boyfriend. My friends want to get high or drunk all the time i feel like i have nobody. And i dont wanna go into a job this depressed. Ive seeked help. Ive took meds for anxiety and my bipolar 1. Its just hard for me and most don\u2019t understand it. I know getting this money i can buy new things. I can afford to take my girl out. I can finally do shit. But im scared. I dony like to go outside anymore. I feel so small in groups of people i keep my hands in my pockets i dont make eye contact i feel like a wimp. And if i dont get this job my dad is gonna kick me out. My mom wont talk to me.

The idea behind exposure being exposing yourself to what causes you anxiety, riding it out, seeing it isn't so bad, and learning that there's no reason to be anxious and ultimately recover.  \n\n\nThe problem is that I can't just ride it out. For example, I somewhat recently went to a little going away party for some family that way going to be moving out of state, and during that I had severe and long lasting anxiety. My heart rate, which is usually in the low 60s, was over 100 for about 5 hours straight, even though I was sitting the whole time. Combined with this I was also usually pretty aggressively bouncing my legs, fidgeting, and shaking, sweating, and occasionally messed up breathing. The only reason I started to not be as anxious was because towards the end of the night, where I genuinely starting to become to physically exhausted to keep it going. Of course, when I left it went away pretty much almost instantly. This is only one example, but the majority of the times I'm anxious it usually lasts for hours upon hours of end.  \n\n\nBut overall, the problem remains that the usual advice of \"You can't  be anxious forever, you'll have to calm down eventually\" is that I absolutely can be, ending only when I finally leave (which is essentially avoidance and running away. which doesn't help towards getting better).   \n\n\n  \nFurthermore, probably the biggest source of my anxiety, is anxiety. I largely get anxious because I believe going and doing this thing will provoke crippling and hellish anxiety. And when I go do that thing, it provokes the anxiety. It's hard to try and analyze cognitive distortions, or do the negative thought worksheets because it feels like it amounts to:  \n\n\nI'm afraid to touch the stove because it will burn me. I touched the stove and I got burned. My fear, despite essentially being some paradoxical loop reinforcing itself and originating from nothing, has been completely confirmed, and my anxieties even further reinforced. Even worse is knowing that the answer is apparently \"keep touching the stove and eventually it'll stop burning\", but I've been touching the stove for years and years now and it still burns.  \n\n\nAnyone have any experience or advice for very long lasting anxiety attacks or anxiety caused by anxiety?", "title": "Can't Ride Anxiety Out"}, {"created_utc": 1622862351, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/nsm8ll/anyone_have_a_problem_going_out_to_dinner_with/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Idk, I genuinely feel as though when I go out, I\u2019m getting judged by them.

To be quick, during that conflict, I did understand the instructions of the assignment well, and I did a little mistake during my shift. The colleague that was there during the shift, which was acting as team lead, told me at the end of the shift that I was never doing anything correct and that I was the only team member that needed to be constantly repeated what to do. She was very condescending and mean, and it made me very upset and sad. I asked her if we could talk about it. She said : honestly, no I don't want to talk about it. I was on the verge of depression, just lost another job I really liked, it was a very bad time. Being hyper sensitive, I reacted strongly, was crying and pushed a pencil case on the floor.

However lately I've been experiencing these random episodes where I begin to feel slightly nauseous, my breathing increases, and overall just feel very weird. It feels very similar to how I feel when I'm actually anxious but the only difference is that during these episodes I'm most likely not even worrying about anything. Like for example 2 days ago I was at work and I was feeling great and then all of a sudden it happened. Basically I'm only feeling the physiological effects of anxiety minus the mental part of it. Although when I'm in this state I've noticed that if I start worrying about something like I normally do, I'll actually become even more worried than if I was feeling normal (which makes me think it is anxiety).

deteriorating and idk what to do. the past few months weren\u2019t that bad but ive had some bad moments that have eventually led up to now. it just feels like my mind is consumed by so much negativity and im having so much issues with a various things that i feel so overwhelmed.\n\ni feel like my physical health is a big part of this. earlier in 2021 i had so much ambition to become healthy, and fit. fyi im a very skinny and underweight person so it was a pretty big goal for me. that was until i decided to \u201cdirty bulk\u201d as it felt hard for me to gain weight. even still, it did not last long and i probably wont do it again. it felt like i just kept giving myself excuses to not eat healthy. that happened until mid last year, when started my job and i stopped working out and dieting completely.\n\ni would completely like to start getting into fitness again, but right now im deep in a hole of laziness and junk/fast food addiction and its harder to get out than it seems. i feel like it impacts my mental health tremendously. one big part is advice that ive heard, to eat what i enjoy if im going to do a bulk but i found it hard to enjoy many of the healthier options and my mind just went to junk food. i also feel like i dont drink enough water as i should.\n\nanother big part is my job which i just kinda mentioned. ever since i started (mid 2021), my lack of motivation started increasing as i was becoming more lazier because of my job. it felt very hard to accustom gym life into work life because i have full availability. something my therapist told me was to just go even if i felt lazy and essentially force myself to do things but it feels so hard. i requested for pto in a couple weeks so i would have a small break to try to adjust myself thankfully\n\none thing that\u2019s affecting my mental health that i feel a bit more embarrassed to talk about is my romantic life. i tend to still maintain a few obsessions when it comes to relationships and its a trait i feel i need to let go of. it does not benefit me and i am afraid of becoming too obsessive. i also feel like my friend who dont get me wrong, i enjoy the company of, but he is kinda a bad influence on my view of relationships because ive never had any urgency to get a girlfriend. ive always felt like it\u2019ll come along the way but he is the opposite, coming out of a relationship and having such an urgency and desperation to get back into one. somehow it feels like this tendency is latching onto me which i dont want to happen.\n\none last thing i should mention is sleep and gaming. sleep has always been a big issue for me and it is not getting any better. staying up late at night doesnt even feel fun anymore. i feel like this is why i wasnt able to really progress when i used to work out. now about my gaming, i feel like video games are the only thing that make me happy right now. i love video games but they are detrimental to my sleep since i stay up late playing them and i lose time during the day. i cant let go of video games but i need to fix my entire schedule. my internal clock is so messed up and i find it hard to sleep at a reasonable time\n\nanyways i hope someone read this because i seriously need the help rn. i want to cry but its so hard. i was just trying to sleep but my head is just overwhelmed by all these thoughts. my head feels like such a dark place right now. i feel so hateful and pessimistic towards a lot of things which is not a pleasing feeling and it doesnt make things any better. any advice

I am now 23, and for the last year or so my anxiety has been gaining traction, I\u2019m struggling to do a lot of the basics again and depression is getting worse. My doctor has been encouraging me to increase my medicine from 20mg daily to 30mg. Again I will do this very slowly. A huge trigger for my panic attacks is taking medications, so I\u2019m just so so terrified of raising my meds or changing them in anyway. But I also want to because I am struggling so much and in theory they should help. I worry about ruining the slight quality of life increase they have given me.

I used to go to school with only a glass of milk and survive the whole day. Until I believe I hit puberty and things changed where my stomach growls EVEN after I have ate enough. Whenever I would be out, with people I couldnt remove the thought of it growling any second. Even after a gap of 1-2 hours it would start again. I realized when Im at home and occupied, it never growls as much as it does outside. Is this because Im nervous when Im outside? I would never have brought this topic up here but it has been causing me to avoid taking in person classes with long hours just because of this, I dont want to embarrass myself. My commute is around a hour, I have labs for 3 hours and I feel like throwing up thinking about this. I dont want to stuff my body with food just to stop my stomach noises. Its been 2 years since I went to school because of COVID and I dont even remember how to sit down around people like Im just so freaking frantic about it. I hate studying at home yet feel anxious to go to the library to study, or go on walks cause Im just like... what are people going to think, that Im a loner or that I dont have a life. It has caused me to just not do well in university too.

I've never smoked in my life, never done drugs, no alcohol consumption. No known history of diseases in my family \n\nSince July my life has deteriorated a lot. It all started at the end of July. I woke up at the middle of the night (5AM) with a very strong chest pain. It lasted for around 30 minutes and I felt like I was dying. I told my mom and we went straight up to the ER. I had an EKG, Echo, and a blood test. Everything came back clear. The doctor told me that it could be the vaccine (I'm not even joking, I had the J&amp;J jab 2 weeks before the incident), but then he ruled out any pericarditis, myocarditis etc.\n\nThey told me to check my thyroid just in case and I left. Fast forward 10 days after I caught covid. I was vaccinated so the symptoms were mild. However I lost my sense of smell and taste that didn't even come back until like a month after.\n\nSo after covid, I was supposed to start an Accutane treatment for my acne. So I had to take CBC again. Everything comes back normal except my wbc that were around 10.1 and lymphocytes 48. (back in July my wbc were perfectly normal). They doctor told me it could be covid, so she said we should repeat in a month or so, to see if they're back normal. Meanwhile I was getting again sharp chest pains. The pain just comes and goes, but it's so sharp that I feel like I'm gonna faint. So I decided that I should see another cardiologist.\n\nI also developed some pain at my upper left abdomen which is also sharp that comes and goes. And I feel ramblings coming from all over my belly especially when I lay down. After a few days I get another CBC done and an ultrasound in my upper abdomen.\n\nThe ultrasound was fine, spleen, liver everything OK. My thyroid results too. They only thing that was off was my Vitamin D, ALP, and my WBC(which had now elevated again at 10.9 and my lymphocytes were sitting at 48). The internist prescribed me some vitamin D supplements and told me to retake the CBC again in a month. The sharp chest pains and the abdominal pains never went away.\n\nI also developed another thing, which feels like pulsations coming all over my body. Like I lay down and I can feel my left thigh having a rapid pulse, I can even touch it and feel the beat. This thing happens all over my body in my chest also! It's not painful. But extremely frustrating and worrisome. I haven't found a cause for it yet. I also went to visit another cardiologist, he looked at my heart and he said that I have a bicuspid aortic valve, and that I also have some arrythmias. So he prescribed me some magnesium.\n\nI was so shocked, because no doctor had ever told that I had a heart disease. This is a condition you're born with. And it can be found on an echo so I should have known about it. He said that the sharp daily heart pains are not heart related, and it's probably a nerve or something. The thing is the pain hasn't still left and it's December (it started in July).\n\nI was confused so I decided to get another opinion from a third a cardiologist, who said that my aortic valve was tricupsid and not bicuspid. He also gave me some photos from the echo to look at it.\n\nNow in November I get a CBC again (everything normal again except my wbc 12.5 this time and lymphocytes 48 (the absolute count is 5.9% when it should be like 2.0-4.0% so I'm a lot off). Now 3 months have passed since covid and my wbc are only getting raised and raised. My internist seemed worried this time so he said that I should see a hematologist/oncologist. I was so scared. Leukemia was the first thing that came in my mind.\n\nI set an appointment with the oncologist 2 weeks after the results. In the meantime, I got gastroenteritis. I had a high fever 39C for like a day. Constant diarrhea and some vomit. I set an appointment with a gastroenterologist and I told her about my abdominal pains since October. And the constant ramblings I have but she brushed it off. She said I'm too young to have something. And she just prescribed me some omeprazole for 30 days.\n\nThe gastroenteritis passed, but I still have the ramblings and the abdominal pain every day.\n\nI met with the oncologist and I told him about my situation. He told me that it could probably be a reactive lymphocytocis. And he's sure it's not blood cancer. Because I have zero of it's symptoms. (night sweats, constant fevers, swollen lymph nodes etc). He said I should retake the CBC again in December. But he also said that I should check my Igg, Iga, igm, CRP, HDL some things like that. But he emphasized on electrophoresis. He said that if electrophoresis comes back normal there's no chance I have blood cancer. He also said if I had cancer, covid would have killed me, but it was even mild for me\n\nI had the CBC 2 days ago. The results will be given to me on Tuesday. Im still waiting. I have lost my sleep from it, I suffer from insomnia. I usually don't sleep at all at night. And get my sleep from 5pm to 10pm, I feel constant ramblings in my belly, constant abdominal pain at the upper left.\n\nSharp chest pains where my heart Is that makes me faint. (I also had a 48hour Holter monitor which showed a few benign ectopic beats). I get that it could be a nerve pain, but can it be stopped? I was a great student, my grades have dropped drastically. From 90% to 30%. I can't even concentrate anymore. I'm in pain, the only thing I think about is my health. I can't live like that. I'm an 18 year old with no previous illnesses. I was totally healthy in June. What the hell is going on. It's been 4 months. I haven't had a normal day since then. My parents think I'm faking it or that it's only anxiety and stress but I don't think so. \n\nI'm sure that it could be something like cancer, like a a stomach tumor or something. If it was something simple it wouldn't be so persistent. It should probably pass, but it hasn't. I don't want to die yet, I'm young. I want my life back. Why can't I be normal again. The doctors just set me another appointments everytime I see them, 4 months have passed. I haven't even received a diagnosis yet. I just keep getting new appointments every 2 weeks.

Btw am taking medication, I was doing CBT for a while and just when they started taking it seriously they sent me off to someone else because they said I'm doing better. CBT in my opinion has made me aware that they aren't actually trying to \"fix\" the problem. They just explain to you why you're feeling that way and explain it's totally normal. But when faced with family or in this case work situations provide no actually skills to help you. My new councilor is providing me with skills and resources now.. years later.. And I'm noticing people around me don't want me to improve my mental health or become better because it's the pandemic now. Everyone is so petty they just say they are under stress too but have no inkling of a clue of what I've been going through for the past 5 years. I have the counseling profession at a stand still.. They said.. Have you tried telling them? Well.. Maybe it's just my age 30's or my work environment but most people don't relate/care.

I think I am someone who has always struggled with some degree of anxiety- as long as I can remember I have really struggled with presentations, reading aloud, speeches etc. However, apart from this, I have always been a confident, outgoing person who likes to be around people.\n\nI think for a little while I've known that my feelings have been really building up in the background and in some ways I am under a reasonable amount of stress from school and thinking about university and my future. About 7 weeks ago I went to a party and smoked a very small amount of weed (my first time properly doing that) and that caused me my first ever panic attack that was like the worst form of mental torture that exists, heart out of control, completely pale, trembling, nothing I could do to help myself. I think I also suffered from a degree of disassociation and at one point I could barely feel any pain.\n\nIn the days after that experience, I continued to struggle in many ways, mainly to do with my perception of my surroundings and I felt like I wasn't focussing my attention on things very well. These symptoms were noticeably improved when I was able to lie down and just distract myself by playing games on my phone. I went to school after the weekend, however, and I managed okay. Still feeling a bit funny about my surroundings and my focus, but it was getting better. Then I had two weeks half term holiday. For the first week, I did very little. However, I cannot remember really thinking to myself that I was still having problems or felt funny. It was only in the later part of the 2nd week that I was aware that my prior symptoms seemed to return a bit. This got me increasingly distressed, I was now really thinking that smoking had somehow changed my brain chemistry and ruined me forever. I was then told by my uncle who was with us at the time and is an ex GP that I was most likely suffering with anxiety. This was hard for me to accept, as I knew I often got anxious but never would I have considered myself to be someone with 'anxiety'. \n\nThat was probably 4-5 weeks ago, and for much of the time since then I have been in school and still struggling a bit but managing it. However, it was getting worse and worse and internally I was losing control and becoming more overwhelmed, even though there has not been a particularly obvious external cause. Since Saturday (that is the 27th nov) I have been really really really struggling and its only been getting worse. I was in school Monday and Wednesday but struggled quite a lot on both those days. When I am at home, I have been experiencing nothing short of mental torture, hell on Earth. I lie in bed or watching TV but virtually nothing can distract me from my thoughts. I am completely overwhelmed/ terrified/ scared. I just lie down and my heart is often pumping quite heard and my palms are sweating and I constantly feel sick. I have barely eaten over the past week and I can't imagine that helps. There have been moments over the last week where I have had some degree of a break and calmed down enough to eat or sleep okay, but apart from that it is non stop torture. I seem to think about the past very negatively and memories appear very sad- thinking about times I was on holiday for example and just associating them with sadness and feeling terrible. All my memories seem sad even though I have been happy for most my childhood. The future, be that of an hour away, a year away or 3 decades away seems scary, overwhelming, unachievable, distant. And the present is just me being unable to eat, sweating, trembling, crying, questioning whether I am in a dream and nothing really exists. I cannot stop thinking about my situation and anxiety and all the possibilities for treatment and whether this will ever end.\n\nIt has brought me to be borderline suicidal, as I can't see how my pain will end. My life has been completely destroyed and I have lost control. All for no obvious reasons. I am stuck in such a horrible, terrorising feedback cycle with no way out. My dreams are vivid and are just an extension of my waking hours- anxious, terrifying etc.\n\nI saw a counsellor yesterday (Friday morning) and felt a bit calmer after our appointment, but throughout the day I gradually unwound and feel utterly despairing again. Last night, I was trembling, confused, scared and just wanted it to stop. I also spoke with my GP yesterday and we talked about applying to CAMS (UK mental health service) and about taking some over the counter calming products like Kalms. However, I do not think this will significantly ease my pain. I just can't manage my feelings and the breathing/calming techniques I have been taught help a little temporarily but do not really ease my pain. Often I just want to be sedated and for this to stop. I think I may need something immediately like lexopram or another SSRI. Writing this has distracted my enough to calm me down a bit but I know it won't be long before the complete terror returns.\n\nHas anyone been here before, how did you cope, are you doing better now, can I make an almost full recovery?

It was great and then covid happened. Everything switched to online. I don't want to train online and I ended up losing my passion for it. It wasn't great money anyway. \n\nI considered graphic design, ux design, marketing, copywriting, but it takes so much hard work and I'm scared of going to college and falling into debt. It takes a portfolio and so much effort and time to get together. The more I looked into each of these, the more I decided I wouldn't be happy simply trying to gain a business revenue as a career. That doesn't make me happy. It's not actually making a difference. These businesses are corrupt anyway.\n\nI looked into becoming a yoga teacher, except they don't get paid well. But I love the holistic aspect (I was very holistic in my PT job) I want my life to be more spiritual and based on actually helping people. That gives me and my life meaning. Simply gaining a business revenue sounds awful and draining. Anyway, the more I looked into teaching yoga, the more I learned that yoga teachers are struggling and generally unhappy. \n\nSo recently, I've been looking into becoming a therapist. I'd really focus on helping people that way and can be as holistic as I please. That career isn't about simply gaining a business revenue, and you don't necessarily have to go out and score clients (I hate this) but generally your clients come to you and you can even work from home doing therapy nowadays. It looks overwhelming to get into though. 100k into debt to get a doctorate and then deal with the state licensure and everything else. That seems very stressful. \n\nI keep finding things in these potential careers that hold me back. I'm 22 and having zero clue on what I want to do with my life is stressing me out to the max. Mainly because the cost of living keeps rising and rising and I feel like I can't keep up.  The thought of going to college and going into massive debt terrifies me because I don't understand how people deal with or can afford student loans, rent, and a car. It makes no sense to me.

I study something that is not my cup of tea but due to pressure from parents to do sth I went along with it. Went there totally unprepared with zero knowledge. Ofc, everyone else was just a bunch of experts. No, like literally. 35-40yo ppl with tons of experience and academic background are my classmates in this bachelor's degree. I struggled like crazy due to being in my first year and drowning into the ocean alone. It all started during the 1st lockdown. Barely passing, barely any recognition of my work, just pure hectic life.\n\nOn top of that, I had just broken up from my 1,5 year long distance relationship with a guy I really wanted it to work.

We had common interests, always something there to discuss. It felt so comforting knowing that someone is there to listen. I had 2-3 friends my age too at the time whom we'd vibe with. Kid u not guys, fast forward to lockdown everybody vanished for no reason, without any closure. Nothing. Just never spoke to me again. It was almost literally like a domino effect, one after the other. There was never a fight or a misunderstanding causing this. Still I have no closure. I was alone all summer. And im the introverted type of person, so this was not something new that made me sad or I couldn't stand it. I been a loner all my life. But at some point...It really did start becoming lonely... I'm not blaming anyone, I'm wishing well for all, and then I think to myself...Nobody owes me nothing...not even a closure. They felt like cutting me off cuz they simply felt like it, cool, so be it. It hurt me but I didn't dwell on it obsessively.\n\nI haven't had intercourse with anyone yet. Virgin at 20. And this is something that was messing up my confidence. Everybody around me started fucking, sleeping around cuz it was \"fun\"or even started a family and here I am, not being able to say I know what any of this feels. I just never felt the need to rush it unless I could trust and vibe with the other person. So many people I had met never really clicked with me to say \"yes now I feel ready to take it a step further with you... It just never felt right to me giving something so intimate of mine to someone who after me is gonna do it with anyone else regardless lol.. So I wait... The events that took place with my friends and my exes in the past have made me incredibly closed off. Yes,I would enjoy my own company and stuff, but now it has become too much. I do not have a single friend, im in my shell and I find it impossible to trust. Deleted majority of my insta followers cuz in reality I didn't have a single true friend to go out for a coffee with...\n\nAnd I know things have gotten worse when I can barely get out of bed and attend lectures in person, or present a project or walk on the massive hallways full of people without crying or getting massive anxiety.

Sometimes it feels like everything is unreal around me or like I\u2019m tripping/too high on something (I\u2019m sober, don\u2019t even drink anymore.)\n\nI recently started a lower dose of my meds (diazepam) and was thinking maybe it was brought on by benzo withdrawal, however I\u2019ve been back to taking the normal dose since and my symptoms have not eased up. I\u2019m also on an extremely low dose (1mg\u2026.switched to taking .5mg last month) and I don\u2019t know if this would warrant the extreme symptoms I\u2019ve been having.\n\nThis is affecting my quality of life. I had to call out of work all weekend. I stayed at my parents\u2019 and one night my mom stayed over here with me. I can\u2019t relax. I would never, ever harm myself (I\u2019m scared to die so I would call the paramedics/go to the ER above all else) but after living like this for a week I understand why people do. \n\nMy doctor wants me to go back to a psychiatrist to get on medicine again. This doesn\u2019t help me in the short term.\n\nI don\u2019t know why this is happening. My guess is PTSD (*TW* suicide) from finding my sister\u2019s body 4 years ago, stress from work (I am a bartender), stress from my relationship (my bf and I have been fighting a lot recently), the \u201cnormal\u201d amount of anxiety/depression I deal with\u2026etc.\n\nThe physical symtoms that are still happening are inability to stay asleep, nausea when/after eating, low &amp; dull cramps in my lower abdomen/lower back\nache (my period started on 2/5 and lasted 5 days), random chest pain that radiates above my heart, dizziness/room spinning. Everyone is telling me it's \"just anxiety\" but I'm so scared that something else is wrong.\n\nI did contract COVID on 12/25 (double vaxxed and boosted, thank goodness) - tested positive on 12/28 and had symptoms for about 5-7 days.

More and more as I try to navigate my newly realized trauma-based anxiety I realize, you will never, ever, convince your brain that it's safe and okay to do something with thinking and logic alone. Anxiety is not something that can be fought with words.\n\nFor example, I worry I'm playing my computer too loud and the people outside my window can hear me (even though it's a very reasonable volume, I'm talking 20) so I turn it down or put in headphones, I feel better, I move on. What my brain learned from that experience is that it's safe to wear headphones and listen quietly, and unsafe and uncomfortable to listen normally. Another day passes, and I'm faced with the same anxiety again and again. Now, the good part of being faced again and again is that every time I am I have the opportunity to break the cycle. What if one day I didn't turn down the volume, what if I sat there biting my nails and rocking in my office chair nervously for a while, waiting for something bad to happen that I don't even know myself what it could be, and what if I got through it? Well, in that case, my brain has just learned that actually, it is safe for me to listen at a normal volume. Eureka! I wasn't yelled at or emotionally harmed, in fact, nothing happened at all. I didn't like having to sit in my fear, but my brain learned a very important lesson: *this is safe.* \n\nI think the hardest part of it all is fighting that initial urge to go back to what my brain already knows is safe, it's one of the most primal desires we have. I'm not going to come here and say this fixed my anxiety, In fact, I rarely challenge it at all, but knowing this information I think is really important for us as people with anxiety. Our brains are scared children that we need to teach what is safe and what isn't, which seems easy when you say it but when it's your own brain, that's what makes it so hard. I don't know if I came here and wrote all this for no reason because its obvious, but for some reason, I always thought the day will come where I feel like I can do it, the day will come when I can eventually convince myself it's not that big a deal, but the day will never come, not as long as my brain doesn't know it's safe, I have to teach it through experience, not words.

My friend are the most important people in my life; they are my found family. Over the years, I have lost connections with those that I have been closest to, and I have never really ever had a good explanation as to why. I understand that sometimes life just pulls people apart, but these instances are different because life events haven't happened to cause the separation.\n\nOver the last year and a half, I have made the closest friends I have ever had (they are husbands, we will call them J and T). We share a connection that I've never had with friends before; the level of mutual trust, respect, support, and appreciation had been unquestionable. They helped me as I got it of a 6 year toxic relationship, the death of a close friend, and left a dead end job that I was miserable at. I also have been there to support them with a stressful sudden move, encourage them when they lost their jobs sure to the pandemic, and losing two close friends of their own, as well as supported them through marital issues from time to time, etc. There is a deep mutual love there, yet I have always had this underlying fear that they would cut me out at a moment's notice like I have experienced multiple times in the past.\n\nA couple months ago, one of these friends (T) and I had a dispute over a misunderstanding about how I felt he was treating my boyfriend. While it was an emotional dispute, there were no insults exchanged, no yelling or raised voices, and apologies were exchanged at the end of it. I felt an intense amount of guilt surrounding this, and still do to this day. Things have not been entirely the same between he and I since then, and his husband was extremely supportive of me. He even went as far as to promise me that he would never just cut me out of his life.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I went on vacation with J. While we had a lot of good times, there were a couple of moments that caused problems. Leading up to it, I was questioning his interest in going at all because he wasn't involved in planning it the itinerary with me even though we had planned to. One night I went to visit an old friend from high school that lived there, and J was convinced that I was lying to him and instead had gone to hook up with some random person. On one of the last nights, J got very drunk and spent a lot of money on dancers at the bar, private dances, and got me kicked out of the bar for trying to pay one of the dancers to come back to the hotel with me to have sex with me (which I was obviously not okay with). In the 3 hours we were there, I was in his presence for a total of maybe 10 minutes cumulatively. The rest of the time he was spending time in the private room and back bar, unbeknownst to me while I say alone at the front of the bar. Despite this behavior, I made sure he got back to the hotel with me at the end of the night and waited for him outside the bar for an hour until it closed. The next day he called me a terrible vacation mate and went as far as to say that he needed time to determine what value this friendship was providing him and how much he is willing to commit to it. He said that my behavior had been problematic for months and that he wasn't convinced that I was committed to personal growth, and until he was convinced that I was, he wasn't sure that he could trust me.\n\nThis all sent my abandonment anxiety into overdrive in a way that was all too familiar. My therapist recently diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder, something that he had been assessing for months. After learning more about it, I see how the issues I've had with my friends may have been in relation to behaviors that had manifested from my disorder and until now I couldn't identify them until there was a problem.\n\nIs there anything I can do to mend these relationships? These are very important people to me, and I want to salvage or repair these relationships if I can. On a larger note, does anyone else have these same anxieties with abandonment from friends? If so, what helps you, and what do you recommend?\n\nP.S.- Sorry for the long story.

Her period has always been so very irregular, like I'm talking it could be the middle, end or beginning of the month, or even straight up skip it. Typically it would be near the end of each month (which it currently is) and she has almost no symptoms of pregnancy or her period, so now I am left to wonder if she skipped her period and thus she's pregnant, or is it just not going to come for another few days or something. I only work two minimum wage jobs and I'm 17 years old, I tried to do everything right and be safe, I refused to have un-protected sex yet still the condom broke. I am so unbelievably scared about even having the chance of her being pregnant. two lines on a fucking stick could change my life forever and it makes me sick just thinking about it. The weirdest thing was that she had period symptoms a few days ago then they suddenly vanished, she feels 100% normal. It's been about a week or so since the condom broke. I keep asking her questions like; do you feel sick? Are you getting any pain in your stomach? Do you feel your period coming? And it's a no from almost every question I ask, still I do understand most pregnancy symptoms don't start until about a month or so. I am not sure if it's even likely she could have gotten pregnant given the time it happened, I can't quite remember, is ovulation before or after the period?

My ideas and views on things have changed, are changing, and are constantly being challenged by myself and the world around me. As a people, we came so far in technology, science, infrastructure, and the organization, complexity, and appearance of functionality of our different societies. We have all of this knowledge, and increasing and growing knowledge, on all sorts of topics such has health, biology, medicine, AI, architecture, electronics, agriculture, food, and just about anything you can name. Despite this, the most \u201cwell off\u201d countries can\u2019t even take care of their sick, homeless, hungry, and so on. \n\nI don\u2019t want this to be political in nature, as I don\u2019t think politics and the American political system can solve these issues. I think there has to be some sort of societal change in how we view the world at the most foundational levels. I think people as a whole and as individuals will have to take compassion, kindness, and love over greed and self-interest. That\u2019s really general and vague, but I think if there\u2019s a fundamental shift in society in our attitudes and values, everything will follow. \n\nWhile I was never one of those weird anti-climate change people, years ago, I feel like I was indifferent towards it. Being pretty young still, the future of our physical planet has been increasingly contributing to my anxiety as much as my hypochondria and the future of people and society. \n\nIt\u2019s sad to see what people have done to the world, but anything we can do on an individual level seems usuales. I know it\u2019s not useless, at least completely, but that\u2019s how it feels. Corporations and governments that have the ability to significantly help fix climate change have never seem to care. They paraded the Greta girl around to say \u201cHey look, we care about climate change, or at least we want to look like we do, but we don\u2019t really want to do anything about it.\u201d\n\nI have a weird, somewhat illogical fear contributing to it all as well. I\u2019m afraid of getting diagnosed with something like diabetes or another \u201cserious but very treatable with modern medicine disease\u201d, and society collapsing and treatment options along with it.

I'm still processing everything that's happened. It's been quite a whirlwind to say the least.\n\nI was 24 years old when I had my daughter Sophia (She's turning 6 this year). She wasn't planned, and by this point, I had been with my ex for 5 years. He was my first...everything. I was young when I fell in love with him.\n\nI did grow up in a rather conservative household. I felt ashamed that I was sleeping around with him, engaging in pre-marital sex.\n\nHe comes from old money. They are blue bloods. His father is a renowned businessman in our town (its actually an international multi-industry company). My ex and his older brother are due to inherit the family business. He's never had to work for anything his entire life. He's never been close to any of his family, and his parents divorced when he was young (and of course, he was deeply shaken by that).\n\nWe did break up after 5 long years together. He moved abroad to deal with his company's bankruptcy and other politics going on after his dad passed away. Even a bit before, he started to grow distant and that did worry me. He said leaving to clean up the mess was his only option. He broke it off with me and said he had no time to play romance. I didn't want to let him go that easily. I couldn't believe that he would just leave like that. I even showed up at his front doorstep at 6 am (on the day he was set to travel abroad). He kept saying he didn't love me and even gave me a blank check to fill out. He told me, \"However much you want, just fill it out and take it. Whatever it takes for you to leave.\" I was so upset. I couldn't control my tears and anger. I slapped his face and walked out. He really broke my heart.\n\nI found out I was pregnant not long after. I was nervous about telling him. My friends were supportive of me, so I called his office and asked to speak with him. I heard his voice it the background as I spoke to his secretary. I heard him tell her, \"Tell her to fuck off.\" I had to beg the secretary to let me speak with him, who said that she was given strict orders not to let me through. I called for days afterwards but he didn't want to speak with me. It hurt. A lot. So I decided that I would never bother him again. That was the last straw.\n\nHonestly, I never thought I'd see him again. I had my close group of friends who I've known since middle school. My ex and I share a mutual friend (he's actually my best friend), Nathan. I never told Nathan about how my ex treated me (by not letting me through to tell him about my pregnancy) because I didn't want to jeopardize their friendship. Nathan postponed his wedding to his long-term girlfriend to this year (summer 2021).\n\nOf course, I found out that my ex would be in attendance and Nathan asked me if I'd be okay with it (and the fact that my daughter would also be there). I assured him that my ex was officially a closed chapter in my life. I wasn't bothered at all, I wasn't afraid of him, I had nothing to hide. The truth is, that was all a lie. Wasn't able to get any sleep that night. I tried to put on a brave face for my friends, and more importantly, didn't want to burden Nathan on his wedding day. I thought somehow I'd be able to avoid him through the entirety of the event. That really was wishful thinking on my part.\n\nHere's when all the drama went down.\n\nI had a lot of fun initially at the event. Then the ceremony started. I was the maid of honor and walked down the aisle, joined the bridal party on stage...and then noticed him. He was sitting in the front row, STARING right at me. I was half angry and a part of me still loved him, I'm ashamed to say. I felt so tense and uncomfortable. I just pretended that I didn't see him. My thoughts immediately flew to my daughter. I wanted to keep her out of his sight.\n\nWhen the ceremony ended, I went to go find Sophia. I started to grow pretty frantic in my search. My friend Isabella said she'd watch her for me.\n\nTo my utter dismay (and terrible luck), she happened to stumble upon my ex, making friendly conversation with him (he never likes kids usually which was strange). I overheard her say, \"Mister, can you please help me find my mama?\" She noticed me and ran to my side, saying that she had gotten lost, while I stood frozen taking this all in. It was the first time we had seen each other in years. I'm not sure if he was able to put the pieces together right there and then. He gave me a strange look, looking back and forth between my and my daughter. I didn't have the courage to say anything to him, so I grabbed my daughter's hand and ran as fast as I could.\n\nI heard him scream my name and continued on my way to the parking lot, started my car, and left without a word. My daughter was visibly upset, but, I just couldn't explain what just happened to her. When I got him, I received so many missed calls from my friends. I just ignored them. Didn't even have the energy to deal with anyone.\n\nMy friend Isabella called me the next day and she told me that my ex punched Nathan square in the face and a fight broke out at the wedding. (My ex was angry that everyone else knew I was pregnant around the time we broke up and that no one had the decency to tell him).\n\nAfter a long day at work, my ex showed up at my place. He must have gotten my address from one of our friends. He was beyond angry. I was angry that he just showed up here, and, we argued. He of course confronted me about our daughter. He threatened to take her back with him. I was horrified. He asked why I didn't tell him and I reminded him of the times I tried to get through to his office but he refused to speak with me. Supposedly he said he never received my phone call. He made up an excuse that the men who worked with his father didn't want anything distracting him (my ex) from becoming the CEO of their family company. The voice that I heard telling me to \"fuck off\" apparently was a hoax. Supposedly, I was a distraction and a threat to him moving up in the company. I'm still not sure how to make sense of that.\n\nSo after things simmered down, my ex said he really wanted to be a part of his daughter's life. So then we arranged some time during the week for him to come and get to know her. I was reluctant, but, knew she needed a father.\n\nIt's been a couple weeks since then, and, she really seems to have taken a liking to him. She asks him a lot of questions. He has grown fond of her as well. My ex decided that he will move back to our area so he can spend time with her.\n\nThis has become routine now, he visits her everyday afterschool and they have dedicated time with each other. Things have changed so much. It was definitely hard being a single parent, and now with him back in our lives, I don't really know what this means for our relationship.\n\nThings got a bit complicated when I was recently introduced to this new guy by another friend. He asked me out over the weekend and we had an amazing time together. (and during that time, my daughter had spent the day with her dad). I'm not sure why...I felt like I was being an irresponsible mom and I certainly didn't want to tell my ex about this new guy. It wasn't his business.\n\nThe date was over and I made it home in time before my ex and my daughter arrived. She was telling me all about their day at the park and how much fun she had. My ex was very quiet when he came in. I eventually put my daughter to bed and had hoped that my ex would leave soon. I don't know how, but, he found out about the new guy. My ex asked who he was. So I told my ex a bit about him. He then goes on to tell me that I don't have to lie to him and that I can date whoever I want. I told him I wasn't sure how he'd react. My ex blatantly said, \"We are not together.\" Those words did sting, but yes, that was true.\n\nI don't know...I just felt upset so I excused myself and walked into the kitchen trying to distract myself with the dishes. One of the plates had fallen, and, a shard pierced my skin. So I tried to take care of the wound. My ex walked in and saw me in pain and cleaned it up for me. Then, things moved so fast. He kissed me and I didn't know how to react. I couldn't control myself. I loved him so much. We ended up having sex that night. And to my surprise, he still had my initials tatooed on his back.\n\nThat was really long, I know. I really don't know what to do. I'm still in love with my ex...does he still feel the same way? Now we have a daughter that we share...and I started seeing this new guy. I will probably get a lot of downvotes here. I feel like I'm a terrible example for my young daughter.

It seems like a mole that once you knocked it on it's noggin it just pops it's head up somewhere else. Regardless, this technique has really helped me in all of the situations and has become a staple.\n\nThe thing that really helped me was the worry pad technique. When you have thoughts that are based in anxiety write them down on a worry pad (or a piece of paper) and once a day at a time of your choosing (like 5pm) you look at the list and think on those things or worry about them then. If the anxious thoughts/anxiety pops up in a time that's not your set time then tell yourself that it's written down in the worry pad and you'll worry about it at your set time and just continue on with your day. If you forget to look at the list at your set time then just worry about it at that time next day, again tell yourself that it's on the pad and you will worry about it at your set time. Only worry about it at the time you have set. Don't set any alarms to remind yourself but if you happen to remember at the time you have set, then look at your list and go through your listed anxieties and dwell/think/worry about them then. Only do this for about 15 minutes or so max. The goal is to get to the point where you don't write them down on the pad but instead set the time in your head and rely on remembering the worries. So a pad-less worry pad.\n\nThis had really good results for me and helped tremendously (still does if it pops it's head up) so I hope it alleviates some of your problems too. Obviously if you haven't tried therapy then you should try and schedule an appoint both to get professional help for the condition and to see if you have depression because anxiety and depression both cause each other.\n\nAlso as an aside if you happen to be drinking it, try to reduce your caffeine intake (not all at once!).

But in the past 2 months I seemed to have developed a few new tones, especially on the left ear. It\u2019s causes some unease and lots of anxiety about the cause. And spending way, WAY too much time on the internet looking for reassurance. Some sound sensitivity, distortion and annoyance is mixed in with the tinnitus too. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve noticed a couple variations of a low pitch tone. One sounds like an electrical hum and the other sounds like a very low pitch bass that vibrates the ear drum and internal brain. Like an idle truck left running in the distance. I researched these low pitched sensations, and one of the things I came across was this noise phenomenon known as \u201cthe hum\u201d. Beginning in England around 1970, people began reporting low frequency disturbances in their homes around the world with often times the cause being unknown. Likely attributed to modern life with all the frequencies and electricity and other noise in modern society. It apparently effects 2-4% of the population. I had never heard of it prior to the last 2 months doing god knows how many google searches. \n\nAnyway, on top of health anxiety about tinnitus, I\u2019m now panicked about being in this small % of the population affected by \u201cthe hum\u201d and that the noise and vibrating sensation in my ears and head is gonna drive me insane and I will never enjoy peace or a normal life again and this will only get worse.

I was being overbearing to folks around me and it was a source of stress for others.\n\nAmong the reasons for my behavior were wanting to ensure the trip went well (as it was loosely planned and disorganized), wanting to make a good first impression, and admittedly (to my embarrassment and guilt) having a mild crush on one of the attendees.\n\nThere was also an incident towards the end when preparing to head back home. I was intended to be one of the main drivers, but due to understandable circumstances, others wanted to ask if I would mind sitting in another car (it was due to space, comfort of an elderly, and worry of an individual driving back by themselves).

So I'll start off by saying that I am 14 (almost 15) and that I am a very shy, anxious and insecure guy. I've been dealing with really hard times recently but I want to talk about something else. So for the last I am pretty sure 2 years I've been dealing with really really challenging OCD (self diagnosed) never really checked on it because a year before it really started I have been going through anxiety attacks (mostly at night) and didn't know what it was. I got very scared when I had those attacks and most of the time it happened at my dad's house (my parents are divorced) most likely because of emotional reasons. but when I had those attacks I would panic, shake, cry. and didn't know how to deal with it. most of the times I just took something to eat or drank tea or something similar. but after a while I figured it was anxiety attacks and I was learning how to deal with it. never actually \"dealt\" with it but it sorta went away after the age of 12. So back on topic, I started having these weird things I was \"forcing\" myself to do, that really made certain things difficult. but it wasn't something really big of difficult at the time. After quite some time it sort of evolved into (I don't know what to call it) OCD+Anxiety mixed together (and it started off with not that hard of OCD) and I will elaborate; I would have to do a certain thing (or not do) and if I wouldn't than I would \"convince\" myself that something bad will happen. And I don't know what was the first one but one of the hardest OCD's I had (and still have some \"leftover\" of it) is saying \"nvm\" or in my language after almost every sentence. the reasoning behind this was that I was scared people would take what I said to a different direction, I am pretty sure it started off on online chats etc. I personally don't like being rude, toxic to people online because I don't know what they are going through. so I try keeping it nice (unless I know them and can joke around) But I would usually just say Nvm after most things I said because I was scared that someone would think something else and take it personally or whatever. After a while it kind of evolved to doing it in actual conversations in school, my home, basically anywhere. It was a very hard time. but after a bit I sort of stopped doing so after I went to a Psychologist and talked to her about that OCD and other ones I had at the time. I still sometimes say \"nvm\" after things but its better now. but that's just one of the OCD's I had. Nowadays it's very challenging. to the point of actually making me suffer from certain things. As I mentioned before I am very introverted, anxious, shy etc so going outside (school, party, ever to eat) isn't really my go to thing. But one of the hardest OCD's I have currently is very hard to explain but I'll try (and I am sorry if I don't explain myself well its really challenging to share this stuff with others) So I wont explain every single OCD I have but this one in particular is very challenging. So basically I will look at someone (even if its a video from my computer/phone) and if I breathe in I also have to breathe out what I breathed in while looking at them. Let me explain the logic to this OCD because I probably didn't explain it well. I am scared that if I breathe in while looking at someone it would 'harm' them. (I don't want to make it obvious to what I mean. it sort of another OCD I have) So what I do is when I go to school or outside if I look at someone and breathe I have to breathe out while looking at them (which results in really awkward stares, really hard to keep up with a mask on so I sometimes panic, and also just making it hard for me to breathe.) I also have a 'good' OCD which I don't know how to explain but it helps relieve this one. but still its very hard to deal with. I know what I have to do to deal with the OCD but I am scared of doing so. its to the point where I stopped watching non cartoon movies because its really hard to keep up with the OCD. I know there aren't many options besides just ignoring the OCD but I am scared of the consequences of doing so. I have many more OCD's and stuff like that which I didn't mention. and many more things that aren't going well for me but this subreddit isn't about venting and I am sure no one cares about what I have to say about my personal life.\n\nAnyways thank you for reading this.

I've lurked for a while on this subreddit and I'm kind of at my wit's end.\n\nSome background:\n\nPrior to moving to Washington State and just starting my new job, I lived in New Jersey with my parents for more than a decade. I went to school there and had my first relationship there but it was incredibly abusive. My first boyfriend was emotionally abusive, racist (I'm a POC), sexually abusive, misogynistic, and incredibly rude and arrogant to his family. We went out for four years. During this time, I was in and out of mental hospitals for severe anxiety, depression, and suicide attempts. I was hospitalized three times over the course of our relationship, each attempt got worse, and the abuse also intensified.\n\nWe eventually ended it and I soon after went to therapy to treat my anxiety and depression but it worsened. My parents were and aren't understanding of mental health at all. My mom didn't believe I suffered any trauma due to the abuse and blamed me for what I went through. My stepdad had no understanding of what I went through. My friends eventually abandoned me as my relationship with my abusive ex went on.\n\nIt affected me immensely. I went from having a high GPA as a twenty something year old college student to leaving college, moving in with him, and the abuse worsening. After it ended, I was emotionally exhausted and I had horrible panic attacks. \n\n But then, my grandfather, who lived with us, got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I was incredibly close to him. My mom made the incredibly difficult decision of having him go on hospice and we watched him, day by day, gradually worsen, until he eventually passed. He didn't go through chemotherapy due to his age. \n\nI fell into an incredibly deep depression and I became emotionally numb. It was hard for me to sleep. I didn't want to leave the house. I was in shock. It took going to multiple inpatient groups, outpatient groups, and obtaining a case manager to finally breakthrough to me. \n\n\n With the case manager's help, I was able to get a job, I stayed in it for a few years, and I was able to work on my general anxiety and depression and hang out with some new friends. Eventually, I also met my now current fiance.  I don't want this to meander or get too confusing but basically, my grandmother also passed after a few years of dating my fiance. She also had terminal cancer. Her diagnosis was sudden and it shook my whole family to the core.\n\nEveryone in my house was emotional. My mom and I were incredibly grief stricken. We got into heated arguments. First, it was because I took off work due to being overcome with grief over my grandmother dying. I called ahead to request bereavement and my manager approved. I went back to work immediately after my time off was up. I attended my grandmother's funeral and my mom pointedly ignored me.\n\nThis tension lasted for weeks between my mom, my stepdad, and myself. My stepdad and I never had a close relationship and this only worsened it. Eventually the tension erupted into fighting and my fiance and I decided that it was best for me to leave. We drove all the way from NJ to Washington State.\n\nWe just secured a new place and I finally landed a new job. Everything was fine until I started to experience the anxiety and depression symptoms again. I've become incredibly reclusive, I only leave my apartment to go to work and accompany him somewhere because I don't know anyone. I've tried using Bumble to meet girl friends to hang out with, but haven't been able to arrange a meeting with anyone yet. I still have to acclimate to my new job since I just started but I am wracked with anxiety. \n\nI'm irrationally terrified to leave my apartment, to drive even (I've done it a few times and I've been totally fine), and sleeping has been impossible. There's been a few days where I thought of overdosing on pain pills just to alleviate my fiance of the burden of having me around. I've always struggled on and off with these mental health issues, ever since I was a little girl. I'm tired of feeling this way. I've been diagnosed formally by psychiatrists and have been medicated multiple times. I've been to different therapists. This is the longest (about 4.5 years) I've been unmedicated, but now with all of these changes and various other happenings (there's more personal things that have happened that I didn't delve into because this is already so long, I'm sorry \ud83d\ude1e), I feel helpless.\n\nMy fiance feels that my anxiety was exacerbated by PTSD due to the abuse I went through with my ex. My fiance also went through an abusive relationship and he's a former army vet so he's versed in the signs. He knows a lot of people from his company that had or have PTSD.\n\nI'm convinced I need to be on a sleep aid and antianxiety and antidepressants again. I don't know if this is just PTSD or anxiety, but I'm so scared that I'm going to relapse and have a breakdown. I'm scared that my fiance will leave me and get sick of me because of my issues. I'm terrified that I'll fuck up and lose my job. And I'm incredibly scared that all of this will just worsen my mental health. I've looked at various psychiatrists and therapists in my area. But I'm torn...\n\nMy dilemma is that I'm scared to go on medication, on the one hand, but afraid of how much this will affect me if I don't. I haven't had a panic attack at this job yet but I don't want to wait until it happens to do something. The insomnia is so bad that I barely sleep three or four hours a night. Sometimes I do have recurring flashbacks of my ex boyfriend. Sometimes it's graphic. I'm on the fence if I should go back on meds because I'm afraid of the side effects, but I'm also afraid therapy alone won't help anymore. I don't know what to do. I can't mentally do this anymore. \n\nTl;Dr: I have a history of  complex mental health and recently moved to Washington State due to personal issues with my parents; currently struggling with influx of anxiety, possible PTSD, depression, and insomnia.

The reason I'm undiagnosed though is because I don't feel like my doctor is taking me seriously. \n\nI've been struggling with this since my senior year of high school. I'd get random attacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, my chest feeling like someone is tightening screws all over it, shaking, and this terrifying feeling of adrenaline (I described it to my partner as being able to hear and see everything around me all at the same time). It got so bad in college that I was terrified of stepping out of my dorm room, even if it was to get food from the dining hall. It eventually got to a point where my partner and I were chilling in my room one day and I went to go to the bathroom and as I reached for the door knob I had this crippling panic attack that made me collapse and I was pretty much done for the rest of the day (I can't even describe the feeling). She forced me to go see my doctor after that. \n\nMy doctor ran a bunch of tests and scans and told me I was fine and sent me home, but I was still having the panic attacks. I went back after another incident, the doc ran more tests, and told me it sounds like anxiety but that I was \"a big athletic guy\" so he was doubtful. He was pretty dismissive of my concerns, prescribed me xanax and sent me home. I repeatedly told him I was uncomfortable taking it because a bunch of my friends at the time had abused it, but again he brushed off my concerns and sent me home anyway. I ended up not using taking it and just smoking herb instead and looking up with my partner some CBT techniques to help me through everything, which really helped. In my follow up check up months later I told the doctor I didn't take the pills, and his response was \"see sometimes you just need to hear that your ok and you'll be ok.\"  and sent me home. I haven't been back to see him since. \n\nYears later, I've definitely made improvements using the CBT techniques we looked up and don't get panic attacks nearly as often as I used to. My family supports me, I'm outside more and seeing friends and repairing relationships (social distanced of course) and I'm in a really good spot with everything. But I'm also getting ready to start law school in a few months and I'm really really concerned that the stress of law school is gonna trigger me like crazy. I'm also worried that because of the doctor I have, i won't have any institutional or medical support to help me work through it. I also don't have an official diagnosis from any doctor or anything yet, so I'm not sure how I would even go about getting help for it. All of this is really new for my family and me, and we don't really know what to do next. Do i see a new doctor or a therapist (money is tight)? Are there resources I should seek out?

I have always been curious if he would jump on the idea if we ever did break up just because of his sexual tendencies and now i see that I was right.

But in the last year, for obvious reasons, it's gotten REALLY bad, to the point where I always feel I am in a life or death situation.\n\nBefore, I used to worry if I felt really unwell that I had something really serious. But only if I really felt unwell. When the pandemic struck, my mother drummed it into my head that she was going to die if she got covid. Over time, I became extremely worried that I had covid. I started constantly checking my temperature and making sure I could still taste and smell. This was for fear that I was going to get it and give it to my mother and kill her with it.\n\nIt got to the point where most DAYS, I was panicking that I had covid. The SLIGHTEST thing I felt, I assumed it was covid. I frequently got tested - all of them were negative. I started not seeing anyone or doing anything, and started living in the house 24/7 and never leaving, in case I caught covid and gave it to my mother.\n\nThen my dad had a sudden heart attack and died. No warning. He died right in front of us.\n\nSince then, my mental health has done a complete nosedive. I am completely alone and isolated from anyone my age, living with my mother. I feel I can't tell her about my health anxiety because it just stresses her out, so I'm always trying to hide it from her.\n\nNow it's gotten so bad that I am constantly worrying about my health all the time. At least once a week I am calling the doctor. It's been this endless cycle. I feel the SLIGHTEST pain or thing not right. I panic. That makes it worse. I call the doctor and get checked. It's nothing. And then I feel something else, rinse and repeat.\n\nI've had MANY over-the-phone doctor's appointments for things that turned out not to be serious. I even had an ECG and a blood test after I had a bad pain in my chest which turned out to be indigestion.\n\nA lot of people do not take health anxiety seriously. \"Har har har, he thought he was having a heart attack when he had indigestion!\" \"He thought he was having a brain aneurysm but it was just a tension headache, LOL!\" But when it completely consumes your life to the point you can't get excited for anything anymore because you always assume you're possibly having a medical emergency, it is absolutely NOTHING to joke about.\n\nI know that this is a huge problem and change needs to happen, and I am trying to organize therapy, but it's hard to do so during the pandemic. It's affecting my relationship with mom as she is constantly worrying about me now and that's consuming her life.\n\nMy goal is to try to rationalize things and try to tell the difference between \"nothing\" and a genuine emergency.

She has also slept through lessons, completely ignored teachers asking her questions, but all the teachers still have more respect for her,  and she still has a ton of missing assignments. but thats not even because she is depressed or something. she just chooses not to do them. she sees a different set of friends every single day while im at home for the safety of those around me. the only thing i go outside for is work and school (sometimes we have one in person class). idk if i sound pathetic but my grades have always equaled my worth. i dont even feel like trying anymore because my teachers are always going to dislike me no matter what. i dont feel appreciated at all. its really bringing me down and idk what to do. i just want people to see how hard i work and that i really am trying. i feel like nobody understands how hard i am struggling right now mostly due to my anxiety. i just want to feel appreciated. sorry for the rant.", "title": "i feel so unappreciated"}, {"created_utc": 1615298967, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/m174ye/happy/", "num_comments": 8, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I have posted a couple of times.

I just don\u2019t know where else to turn. \n\nTW: anxiety, depression, suicide \n\nI feel like lockdown gave me anxiety and now I\u2019m really struggling to handle it. I\u2019m 18, based in the UK. This time last year, I was preparing for exams, looking forward to starting uni in September 2020. Then lockdown hit. Honestly, I don\u2019t mean to sound shitty, but I never understood anxiety. I never experienced it. It always seemed so distant. Then, a few weeks into lockdown, I just started feeling anxious about everything. Interacting with people, friends, other students, uni people - just gave me anxiety. I\u2019d just put these things off. This started a bad habit of not replying to emails/text messages just because I get anxious about it. I\u2019d felt depression before, I kind of got over it and told myself it was a phase and that I was too young to know what depression was. Besides, I just buried myself in school work and was doing well and felt quite happy for the 2/3 years prior to being 18. \n\nPre lockdown, I was super motivated, sociable and just happy to be a live. Now, I just feel shitty and like I\u2019m on a crazy emotional rollercoaster. It\u2019s like in a 14 week span, I\u2019ll spend 4 days feeling happy, being productive etc.  Then I just took crash and feel shitty for 10 days. And it repeats. \n\nI don\u2019t know why this is. I achieved all the goals I had pre lockdown. I got into my dream uni, got some amazing funding opportunities. I really don\u2019t mean to sound ungrateful, I\u2019m sorry if I do. I just don\u2019t feel happy with it. Idk why. Idk where else to find happiness apart from thinking up wild, elaborate fantasises which just make me feel depressed because they\u2019ll never be reality. \n\nI feel like my friendships and relationships are breaking down. I\u2019ve always been bad at letting people in and expressing my emotions. I always hold something back. Or everything. More of a shoulder to cry on for other people tbh. I always expected to grow apart from my friends I went to school with as everyone went their different ways. My new found habit of not replying to messages doesn\u2019t help much either. But damn I\u2019m lonely. It doesn\u2019t phase me too much right now though, I like my own space. I just feel like I\u2019ll regret it in the future. Not building up more lifetime friendships during uni. I\u2019ve met one person at uni (Platonically), they\u2019re super. I don\u2019t share much with them, but they\u2019re always good company and put a smile on my face. \n\nA lot of my anxiety comes from uni tbh. Lockdown started in March. I went from studying 24/7 to playing video games 24/7. Literally overnight. Until around July/August where I started being a bit more productive, but nowhere near as academically vigorous. Started uni in September and struggled but it\u2019s a tough course so I\u2019m not too fussed. Next term starts, I\u2019m stuck at home, I catch covid and fall behind on work. Now I\u2019m just anxious. It hurts my head. I dont want to be in my head anymore. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to be alive anymore. I just want to give up. I feel like I would\u2019ve already if not for my younger sibling. I love them to bits and the idea of them suffering at the expense of my freedom isn\u2019t one I can justify to myself. \n\nThis has been a long and rambling post. Sorry and thank you for reading. Idk what I want from this post tbh. Just wanted to tell someone how I\u2019m feeling. Maybe talk to someone. I want to hear it\u2019ll all be okay, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll believe it.", "title": "Send help &lt;/3"}, {"created_utc": 1615293035, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/m15f7n/i_went_to_a_specialist_appointment_art_store_and/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I went to a specialist appointment, art store and sushi shop alone today.

This is what happened to me in short version:\n\n2008 - smoked weed and bad tripped. Had a terrible experience, felt like I was dying.\nTwo weeks later, I\u2019m in class in grade 8 and I start noticing things around me are super weird, dreamlike. I start feeling detached from myself and feel like I\u2019m heavily drugged. I leave class and go into a full block panic attack. Feeling dizzy, faint, dissociated, terrified. It was the worst feeling of all time. I thought death was imminent. \nThese episodes began arising frequently. I saw many doctors and counsellors who said this was anxiety and panic disorder. I suffered from this nevertheless.\nWas prescribed SSRI\u2019s eventually. Was terrified of medication and side effects so only took a quarter of my prescribed dosage. Felt horrible at first but eventually helped maybe? Panic and anxiety seemed to dissipate for a year until I stopped cold turkey. \n^ this whole recap was about 3-4 years worth of time.\n\nI started getting good at dealing with my panic and anxiety. However, I was always a hypochondriac and this got worse in 2014. For a few years I was constantly convinced I had cancers or HIV.

Otherwise, my panic attacks were uncommon and I just dealt with them.\n\nThey seemed to go away from 2016-2018.\n\nIn the last few years I have become anxious again.

I\u2019m good at dealing with that, but it seems they can happen without my panic attacks. Can be very disruptive to my life. \n\nI also sometimes get brain zaps or shivers.

I don't have a degree because I dropped out of college when my mental state declined from the stress. I was only doing 2-3 classes at a time, but apparently, even that was too much for me at the time. It's been two years since I dropped out and I still haven't gotten a job. I've NEVER had a job. This is because of how terrible my normal anxiety, social anxiety, and depression have affected me. I've been doing well this past year or so because my family got me a second dog around last November. I love animals more than anything and they have helped me significantly with easing my anxiety. Therefore, I've always known that, in order for me to work efficiently and without having an anxiety attack, it HAS TO be with animals.\n\nI want to work in Animal Care. I'm referring to pet sitting, dog daycares, kennel attendants, etc. The other issue is that I don't have a driver's license (also due to my anxiety) and oftentimes these jobs require a license. I've only found a few that don't.\n\nNow to my actual point, the rest was background info.\n\nSo, I failed miserably...\n\nI finally applied for a job for the first time in my life at 21!! This alone was a huge accomplishment in itself and I'm proud of myself for at least that much. However, it didn't go well. NOTHING EVER HAPPENED THOUGH, IT WAS ALL ME, AGAIN.\n\nI applied to a dog daycare that I met the requirements of, it was close by, they didn't care about a license as long as I had a reliable form of transportation. I'd have been alone with 10-15 dogs. This is literally PERFECT for someone like me in my circumstances so I can't believe what I did, and I'm still beating myself up over it, as I should.\n\nTHEY GOT BACK TO ME THE NEXT MORNING. I had poured my heart out in my cover letter expressing how much I love animals and how I've taken care of my own. They said that they loved my enthusiasm and were surprised by the amount of knowledge I had despite no job experience. IT WAS A MIRACLE. BUT GUESS WHAT? I never replied... fml. My anxiety got to me and suddenly I was extremely convinced that taking an 11 hour night shift was definitely too much for me. Yes, that kind of shift would sound awful to anyone but I'm still beating myself up anyway. I don't think I'm going to be able to find another job that suits me and my situation as well as this one. \n\nAt this time, I keep telling myself and those around me that I'm just looking for another job like this that is during a normal day shift. However, I have this fear inside of me that it isn't just the fact that it was an inconvenient shift. I'm afraid that even when I do find the same position with a better shift, I'm going to spiral again and ghost them like I did the first time...\n\nI'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or comfort, honestly, it's probably both.

I\u2019m new to the salon not cutting hair so this sucks when people act this way knowing nothing about you. \nAnyways, I bring her and the boy back. She immediately is complaining that she\u2019s been at work all day snd she\u2019s tired.. okay cool me too lady. I try to be nice I\u2019m smiling I\u2019m being bubbly. She\u2019s not having it at all she\u2019s glaring at me. She pulls out a picture of the cut she wants. It\u2019s a mullet/Mohawk.. then she shows me another one that\u2019s just a mullet. I try asking her which picture she prefers and what she likes about each one. She immediately is saying \u201cI don\u2019t care I don\u2019t care\u201d and is yelling at her son asking him what he wants. This sucks. I\u2019m a little unsure and she picked up on it and at that point I was done before I knew it. She starts complaining again saying \u201cwell I had HER last time..\u201d and I knew exactly what she was trying to say. She didn\u2019t want ME she didn\u2019t trust me and it was clear. I tried again to figure out what it was that she wanted and then she flat out says \u201cwell can you do this?\u201d Glaring at me like a bug. I respond: \u201cyeah I can totally do that I\u2019m just trying to be sure we\u2019re doing the right haircut that you guys want\u201d she says she doesn\u2019t care again. I get it you don\u2019t like me and you don\u2019t care. At this point I\u2019m sweating I just want to cut the hair and get her out of my way. She wouldn\u2019t let up. She was trying to get me to give the haircut away to my coworker. And guess what. I folded. I was done. I was like \u201cyou know what yeah.. my coworker can probably do this a lot quicker she\u2019s done it before many times\u201d I\u2019m not going to lie that haircut is something I haven\u2019t done a lot. I was willing to do it and work it out because that\u2019s what hairdressers do but she clearly didn\u2019t want me doing it. I folded.. I switched and grabbed her other kid who had a simple fade. She immediately is happy walks over to my coworker and is being super nice and helpful with the haircut. My coworker does it. It takes a long time cause it\u2019s a freakin mullet Mohawk disaster and that takes a long time to get right even for a more experienced stylist. I did the \u201ceasier\u201d haircut and they left... but I let her get her way because I literally could not handle it anymore. I burst into tears after we closed the shop. I\u2019m sick of people coming in and treating me like this. They can see that I\u2019m a little timid and they just walk all over me.

I know going to a doctor is always the most important thing to do. I just really wanted to talk through a really bothersome symptom that has been really upsetting me for the last month and see if anyone relates. I need to talk about this with someone and know that I'm not alone or that it really is anxiety. It is so hard to tell the difference between what is real or imagined or even just exaggerated by anxiety.\nBasically some background information, I have a severe phobia of choking and lots of anxiety due to severe chronic stress. My phobia is so bad that I have to drink shakes, smoothies and soups to get my 2,000 cals in. I recently started seeing a therapist and it has been going very well so far. \nWithin the last month my anxiety got really bad because I got called back to work for the first time since the pandemic began and I am also beginning a master's program. All of this is scary for me because I'm hoping I will be able to cope with the severe anxiety and all. So because I've been really anxious, I've been having lots of extra dairy like milkshakes with whole fat milk to provide extra calories to get me through this hard time. Since I started doing this, I have been getting so much mucus dripping from my nose into my throat. I notice that it happens more when I am anxious. What happens is, I try to swallow but it feels really thick and sticky, which makes swallowing feel forced and difficult. Immediately, because of my fear of choking, I start to get a panic attack. I run to get water or I start coughing/clearing my throat a lot. Sometimes, when I try to slowly breathe in, I can actually feel the sensation of something there, which deeply upsets and scares me. I can feel the mucus slowly starting to go in my airway or it feels like my chest is tight and that I can't get a deep enough breath. I honestly cannot tell whether I actually can't breathe because of the mucus or whether anxiety is just exaggerating the sensation I feel and making it feel as though I can't breathe. This problem began exactly when I started having extra dairy and when I started getting extra anxious so I'm thinking this is some kind of anxiety response. All I want to know is whether or not anyone with anxiety has experienced this mucus issue and whether or not it is actually dangerous or not. I can deal with this discomfort just as long as I can reassure myself each time that it's just anxiety and that I can actually breathe. Can a healthy person honestly choke on mucus? Like choke to the point where it's dangerous? I tried to google this and I read that post nasal drip can make breathing difficult but that only freaked me out more. I can't trust my own judgement right now because my ability to take in information is so distorted by my anxiety fears.\nI know this isn't a substitute for medical advise, but I just thought it would be helpful to hear of others experiences.", "title": "Excess Mucus and Difficulty Swallowing/Breathing Anxiety"}, {"created_utc": 1630709744, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/phfsmt/some_advice/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "My partner has severe anxiety and depression.

(keep in mind everyone makes mistakes) \n\nIn college, I was getting to know this girl and eventually we hooked up one night. The next day or so, 2 of my buddies asked me if we had sex, which I revealed that we did and told them it was good but there was kind of an odd fishy smell.... which is what I regret and feel so bad about. I remember I told them that it wasn't a big deal though and I really like her so don't say anything or something along those lines and tried to just make it positive. ( I was in a strange time in my life where I was very secure in myself being alone and I think I had a vulnerable moment where I just spewed stuff off the top of my head with no filter and wasn't very smart with social skills because I spent the last 2 years with only engaging in mild partying or friends, I think I just had a douchebag moment with some fellow bros and thought it was cool or something). My only excuse really is that we weren't dating at the time, but we ended up falling madly in love and dating for 2 years and this whole situation was never a problem. I really loved the girl, I didn't know how much I would feel for her at the time and don't think I would ever do such a shitty thing like that if I knew. I helped her solve the issue with her OB/GYN and many appointments and frustrating long crying nights and what not. \n\nWe broke up for other reasons, mainly because it was becoming one of the most toxic things ever had in life and lots of things happened (she did some pretty messed up things tbh, I know it's probably a good thing I have moved on and don't have her in my life anymore due to some of the stuff had to go through) \n\nBut this one thing from years ago and before we even dated still sits with me in my mind and beats myself up in my self conscious. I think it is because I told her absolutely everything, but this is the one thing she doesn't really know about and I think it is because I randomly overthink that the 2 friends I told about this are thinking about it like I am or something, which is probably completely false and the least of their worries. \n\nI don't know why I let this get to me as I take it very seriously to treat it as a learning lesson to not disrespect someone's secrets like that again and know that isn't who I am. Also, she caused a lot of pain and hurt to myself as well so idk why I give it the time of day when she doesn't deserve me either from the betrayal's I caught her doing to me, manipulation, control, leading on, hitting me, and acting like I wasn't good enough for her or her friends a lot of the time.", "title": "I have been dealing with this ever since we broke up"}, {"created_utc": 1630709211, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/phfn3g/scared_of_tonsilectomy_so_much/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Im 17 and im so scared of tonsilectomy.Please help me.Scared from anesthesia and scared from pain after and all of that.They are ginormous and i have chronic tonsilitis.", "title": "Scared of tonsilectomy so much"}, {"created_utc": 1641801567, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/s0eqw3/i_am_broken_again_please_help/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, so few days ago, I wrote in another sub, how much I am free after my break up.\n\nBut guess what, as I was finding myself, Mr.ex came back again and shattered all my pieces again, crying and asking to come back.\n\nI could feel my anxiety crawling back in, I couldn't sleep two nights, my only stand was that this time I chose myself, you had the option earlier you walked away leaving everything behind.

Marta told me to come with her. I wasn't going to let her walk by herself at nine at night, so I went with her. Also, I was tired myself and eager to go home.\n\nI texted my cousin Juan to see if anyone was at my grandma's house. He was at a friend's house and wasn't sure. I texted my Uncle James and Aunt Isabel. I called them. Neither of them answered. We got to my Aunt Reyna's house. She was home, but she didn't let us come in because she was going to run some errands. I asked her if she knew if there was anyone at my grandma's house. Last I saw my aunts and uncles, Aunt Reyna was with them, so I figured if anyone knew, it was her. She said yes, that some of them were home.\n\nAt that moment, Alma pulled up, and she drove me home. When I got to the house, no one was there. My phone rang, and then my Uncle James called and said that he was at the plaza but walking back to the house right now. After five minutes, everyone came back. My two aunts and grandma included. While they were walking back, I asked them if they wanted to go back to the plaza. Uncle James told me that I wanted to come back early, so everyone's coming back early.

My aunt was grilling me, saying \"I told you we were going to be in the plaza!\" (She didn't), but beside the point. She then started to look for any mistakes she could \"why didn't you just stay in the plaza?\" \"why didn't you stay at Aunt Reyna's house?\" \"why didn't you contact us?\" I told her that I called both her and Uncle James.

So I\u2019d get dirty looks often and I\u2019d always wave to the neighbors driving thru or taking trash out etc. regardless of how much love I showed my new neighbors I\u2019d always get shit on. And I have a major fault in myself where I try to be friends with everyone and if someone doesn\u2019t like me it eats me alive. I\u2019ve had the cops called on me for parking against the flow of traffic in a culdesac (for those who do know, a culdesac is basically a dead end in a neighborhood street that comes to a big round paved spot and will have 2-4 houses on it typically, like the ed, edd, and eddy neighborhood) anyway it\u2019s getting to the point where I\u2019m hated and trashy for having less than normal cars around. It\u2019s really taking it\u2019s toll on me and today was the lowest I\u2019ve been in a very very long time. I\u2019m struggling. You never know when someone\u2019s going to yell out their window at us for parking on public parking (in front of no one\u2019s house) we\u2019re still leaving room for basketball/ football and whatever else they decide to play. I was cursed out today and I\u2019ve never said one negative word to anyone here. I get watched 24/7, pictures taken of me for working on my car in my driveway and sent to the city for code violations and the cops called so far in early December, on Christmas Day, and today. Struggling is an understatement. I have one neighbor that\u2019s very kind but the other 4 or so seem to want me dead. We don\u2019t make any noise after 7/8 pm and we don\u2019t rip around in our cars. We\u2019re very mindful of the kids and don\u2019t complain when our cars get smoked by basketballs.

This might be a long post but I just need to vent.\n\nAround a month ago I was walking around my house early in the morning when I got hit with this tight/heavy feeling in my chest.  Sat down and it went away, continued walking and it didn't go away.  Went to the ER.  They did ECG, chest x-ray, blood work and nothing was wrong with me.  Went home and slept, got up in the morning and the felt the same way when walking.  In the evening I hit a point where my HR jumped to 100+ and stayed there for 6 hours as I laid on my couch and felt fatigued and breathless.\n\nWent back to the ER the next day and they did the same things + an echocardiogram which showed nothing.\n\nDeveloped diarrhea and a cough for a week but since then, the cough is mostly gone and the diarrhea is on and off but less in the past week.\n\nChest and back tightness and heaviness has been persistent.  It is all over the place, sometimes being throughout and other times localized.  Usually tends to the right side but varies.  Flares up randomly but usually at least a dull, low-intensity feeling at pretty much all times.  When it flares up I feel the need to grab my chest and tense up my muscles.  If I don't or if I try to sit in a relaxed position.  The tightness gets worse and worse until I can't handle it anymore and I'm forced to tense up.\n\nA few panic attacks in the last month, usually stemming from a flare up of other physical symptoms, or the emergence of new ones (as I'll explain later).\n\nFelt dizzy/lightheaded for a week straight at one point but that passed.\n\nLater developed pain/tightness in my right calf that was worse when walking.  Was bad for around 2 weeks but now mostly gone other than the occasional tightness.\n\nRandomly feel pain/numbness in the upper/lower right quadrants of my abdomen.  Very infrequent but there nonetheless.  Some episodes of feeling pain in the side/in my back at the abdominal area when breathing deeply.\n\nI'm pretty embarrassed to say I was in the ER 7 times between early and mid December (thankfully I don't have to pay in my country).  I have wanted to go a couple times since but have forced myself to stop after my family doctor told me to stop.  Was told it was stress/anxiety every single time.  Never had any CT/MRIs done which added to my fears that the doctors might've missed something.\n\nDeveloped some health anxiety where when my physical symptoms would flare up, I'd be frantically googling to see what was wrong with me.  Was fixated on Pulmonary Embolism for a while, then DVT when the calf pain hit.  Angina with the chest pain.  Have gotten this fear a little more under control as I've rationalized to myself that based on my age, there's probably nothing wrong.\n\nMy anxiety now mostly hits when the physical symptoms flare up out of nowhere.  More recently I'm not even really mentally anxious when this happens, more just annoyed that it is happening and that I can't live my life out like I used to.\n\nLast week Wednesday started getting these weird headaches.  Chalked it up as nothing but then I sneezed once and felt a shock like pain on the right side of my head.  Since then that same area has been tender and I sometimes feel this discomfort there when I chew or open my mouth wide.  Had a few episodes since then where along with the headaches (which aren't really painful more just pressure and dizziness), I felt trouble opening the right side of my jaw, difficulty swallowing, and trouble getting my words out.  I thought I was having a stroke but it passed fairly quickly (usually within half an hour) and my headaches are moving around my head and are gradual (I would assume a stroke would stay one-sided and would be sudden).  Last night I had this weird headache that wasn't with pain but after touching that tender area of my scalp I mentioned earlier I felt like the discomfort was coming in waves and there was liquid moving in my head.  Today it's mostly just a dull and heavy feeling on the right side of my head.\n\nStill walk everyday and get 10k steps.  Used to ride my exercise bike around an hour a week but stopped since the last time I did (a few weeks ago), it sent me into a panic attack.  My heart rate felt higher in general the past few weeks (would be 80-100 even when sitting, and then jump to 120+ when standing up and walking), but seems more normal the past few days.\n\nUsually I feel fine in bed and get a good night's sleep but today I'm sitting in bed writing this as I feel chest pain/tightness, abdominal pain with each breath, and that tight/heavy feeling on the right side of my head.\n\nHad my first therapy session last week with more on the way.  Felt like it helped for a few hours.  Hope more sessions will help me with longer term coping.  Have a cardiologist appointment this week (referred from my first ER visit last month) to officially rule out all heart related issues.  Supposed to see a psychiatrist at some point (don't know when the appointment will be set for).\n\nI guess my worries have now shifted mostly towards my future.  I'm in the middle of applying to med school, had some interviews and feel a decent shot of getting in but don't even know if I'll be able to do it with how stressful it's supposed to be and how my physical symptoms are making it hard to function.\n\nLooking for a job since I haven't been out of the house much with COVID and my parents thought it would help.  I agree it's a good idea and I'm looking for one right now.  But I can't help but think how I would go on at a job while randomly having to clutch my chest due to a pain flare-up or having up lie down due to feeling dizzy.  I push through it for the most part during my regular days right now.  But at a job with any sort of responsibility I won't have the luxury of taking a breather or deciding to go home.\n\nMy post has been all over the place and I don't even know where I'm going with this.  It's still sometimes hard to believe that what has been labeled anxiety has made me go from perfectly healthy to feeling all these new symptoms in just one month.  It feels like I never have a break.  I can't even walk the same way I used to or even swing my arms around carefree because I'm always feeling something.\n\nAnybody have any similar experiences?  Ideas on what else I can do?  Does it ever get better or do you get used to it?\n\nAlthough I still have my dream of pursuing higher education, at this point I'd be content if I could just feel well enough to work a minimum wage job.", "title": "Physical symptoms of anxiety making me feel hopeless."}, {"created_utc": 1641790484, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/s0bj9u/the_only_time_im_free_is_when_i_leave_every/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "Peace", "title": "The only time I'm free is when i leave every social media platform , don't look at the news and just dance to my favorite songs"}, {"created_utc": 1641789883, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/s0bcr3/im_nearly_vomiting_at_how_fucked_my_life_is/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "So here is where I at:\n\n- 48M bald\n- ear and head hurting and thought was getting better but flaring up again killing me\n- live alone and it\u2019s killing me\n- drifted away from everyone\n- feel like I can barely function currently\n- anxiety is feeling severe\n\nI just feel totally fucked.

I don't think anything in particular triggered my anxiety, but I've known I've had it my whole life. I vividly remember my first panic attack at 3 or 4 years old. I asked my parents for help one time at around 12 years old. They ignored and dismissed me, and I was too afraid to ask again. I set a goal for myself in college to start over and be honest and open about how I was feeling. By sophomore year, I felt comfortable enough that when mental health came up organically when talking with my best friend, I mentioned how I have been dealing with anxiety all my life. He didn't believe me. It was devastating. He straight up was surprised and was just like, \"what? there's no way you have anxiety.\" Except because I've been dismissed my whole life I've gotten really, really, really good at hiding it. And coping with it, actually. I realized when researching it online that the coping mechanisms I developed were actually things recommended by doctors to do. But those coping mechanisms aren't working anymore and the panic attacks are more frequent and last way longer, and I know I need to seek help. But I'm afraid because:\n\n* I'm 30 and just bringing it up now. What if they don't believe it's as bad as it is considering I've lived this long without help?\n* I feel like at every physical I've never said anything, so they will think I've been lying all this time.\n* I might get put on some intense regime or therapy that I just can't afford. (I am hoping to get medication that I can take if my other coping mechanisms fail.)\n* I don't know if I should tell them I have taken lorazepam before. I was prescribed two doses because I had a panic attack about getting a certain medical procedure done, and I realized that it helped with more than just the procedure-related anxiety. My friend also once gave me one of her lorazepam pills (I know you shouldn't do this, but I was desperate at the time and it was the same kind and dose as what I had been prescribed earlier) when I had a particularly bad panic attack and it helped. I don't want anyone to think I am drug seeking.\n\nIf you have made it this far, thanks for reading.

Unfortunately my anxiety surrounding her still hasn\u2019t gone away. Her presence in the house (I work from home) makes me stressed rather than relaxed. I constantly worry that she is sick or getting sick and am constantly watching her and worrying she will do something destructive or eat something she shouldn\u2019t. \n\nWorse still, I have recently been diagnosed with a degenerative genetic condition that affects my skin, joints and blood vessels and causes chronic pain. I only found out about the condition after we got her, but the huge amounts of daily exercise and her leash pulling has done serious damage to my joints. She doesn\u2019t mean to but she  cuts and bruises me during play.\n\nIt not her fault, but I feel resentment that she triggers my anxiety so badly and has such a negative effect on my physical health. While I do love her, I don\u2019t feel a strong connection to her and never really have. \n\nI feel like the worst person on the planet, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if she\u2019d be better off with another family.

I am a 21 year old female. I am diagnosed with bipolar 1 and anxiety has been a struggle of mine for as long as I can remember. Specifically, since third grade, illness anxiety. My friend once told me a mushroom I had touched was poison and they sent me home early because I was inconsolable. \nFifth grade it only got worse as my hands cracked and bled from constant sanitization. I would sanitize my desk the instant someone touched it, and had touched weed killer at one point and believed for weeks it was going to kill me.\n\nWhen I was 13, I watched my beloved great grandmother struggle with lung cancer. She eventually passed away from brain cancer (she was a smoker). \nWhen I was fifteen, my healthy aunt passed away from a genetic cancer that runs on my step Dad\u2019s side. This made me grow existential beyond help as I realized how easy it was to get a sickness, not know, and then die from it. \n\nI am now 21, and have been facing what I haven\u2019t been paranoid about for a few years. I had my phase where I\u2019d just lay in bed after my aunt passed convinced I had cancer or some terminal illness. That was years ago, now I am back on the same thing. I have gained weight rapidly. 45 pounds in less than a year and ten pounds last month alone. I have always been slim and on the lower end of healthy weight, but now I am overweight and unhappy (though my boyfriend likes the curves haha)\nI am scheduling an appointment to get my thyroid checked out. \nI asked my aunt on my mother\u2019s side about any illnesses and I learned for the first time about factor five that runs in my great grandmothers side. Essentially, a blood clotting disorder that claimed the lives of members in my family. My great grandfathers side was very prone to heart attacks and strokes. My aunt has thyroid and cholesterol issues.\n\nNeedless to say, I was shocked and now I\u2019m living in feel fear there going to find something unrepairable with me.

So I have had a very hard life to say the least, My childhood was far from sweet and I experienced a new very traumatizing experience probably once a month from the moment I was born and that followed me all the way too my teenage years. \n\nMy parents were very bad drug addicts, So we're my siblings and I was the youngest I suffered very bad anger spells and would rage out for attention also had some suicide attempts very young I think first one was when I was 9 years old than more 11, 12, 13, 15, 18 and 20 but besides the point. \n\nFast forward too let's say 12 years old I started smoking alot of weed and drinking pretty heavy until I was 15. When I was 15 I got into a really bad car accident which left me doa, I woke up in the hospital strapped too a bed which made me very angry, Around this time I had been experimenting with Hallusagenic drugs also and had somewhat of an \"enlightenment\" I wasn't angry anymore or have uncomfortable anger fits where I would destroy everything, That part of me died when I was 15 but when I tried something called SAS which is pretty much MDMA I had a bad reaction,\n\n\nI Was panicking very bad all night after that one dose of MDMA first time I had ever experienced anxiety. I woke up the next day, Rolled a blunt lit it and all of a sudden I was panicking not knowing what was going on with my body I went home crying to my mom telling her I was dying that feeling lasted an entire year, I never got on any meds for it. \n\n\nI used hydroxyzine as needed but it just made me sleep and I felt really disconnected from reality in that time, I wouldn't even sit on my porch I was terrified of the sky,, My ears rang and I had huge pressure in my ears made me feel like I was on an airplane. I was completely agrophobic at 15 years old and I had no idea what agrophobia even was until I was 23, When I turned 16 and I just... snapped out of it out of nowhere it lasted one year. I never talked to a therapist, I was diagnosed one time by a CPS worker who came to my house and that was it.. I dropped completely out of school at 15 so my 8th grade year and never went back. The judge granted it due to my mental illness. \n\n\n\nI lived totally normal, No anxiety.. no panic no medications of any kinds. I wouldn't travel or go on vacation, Because it scared me and made me think I was going to panic so I avoided it all the way up till I was 23 years old., I tried last July 21 and nope got all the way too the boarding and refused to take another step.. But in all\u00a0 I went 8 years, No anxiety No panic. Just.. normal. Ive always struggled with not feeling good enough or ruining my relationships by being the one too \"end it first\" because I was so scared someone would break my heart and I had enough of that in my life. \n\n\nWell I recently went through long periods of stress and I'm talking very bad stress not your everyday \"wtf\" like.. the worst case senerio every day for a year of my life. There is a brightside, I had my daughter but for some reason.. and I think it was due too the stress I was under 9 months into her life I woke up one morning in panic high anxiety.. and having panic attacks I found out i had covid late September 21 and it sent me through a spiral. I was panicking every moment of the day, I was given 1mg lorazpam and took vitamins d &amp; c for the covid twice a day for 2 weeks and 1mg lorazpam twice a day for that time also. \n\n\nI woke up 2 weeks later and I was fine for a month no anxiety No panic no fear than boom 1.5 months later I woke up having a total normal conversation with my bestfriend and I panicked... that panic spiraled out of control I think because I was so scared for my daughter I'm a stay at home mom and all she has so I wasn't sleeping I wasnt eating it was really bad. I was at the hospital 4x a week, I refused to be alone I couldn't go in public or drive my car my vision was very sharpened my hearing was very fragile like loud noises hurt so bad Than one time I went they gave me haldol injection and OMG that made my anxiety SO much worse for 3 weeks I couldn't sit still I paced non stop crying panic mode for well... 2 months than I decided I would start zoloft 25mg. That lasted 2 weeks, Sleep or eating was not improved. I went up to 50mg\u00a0 for 3 weeks and sleep got a little better and I was eating fine but still very panicky and anxious 24/7.\u00a0 \n\n\nI am now on 75mg zoloft for 4 weeks and I'm sleeping way better eating way better and can relax just still very anxious..

It's very obvious to the person I'm talking to and only gets worse when they ask me if I'm ok. I have no control over it. I go full on panic attack internally, heart pounding like crazy, I start visibly sweating and all I want to do is make an excuse and run out of the situation. Most of the time I just try to suck it up. In my head I know I've no reason to react like this but my body doesn't agree with that for some reason. Anyone else deal with something similar?\n\nThis has basically led to me choosing to work from home every day to avoid having to talk to people. I also moved to a new state/city about a year and a half ago but haven't made a single friend here (just spend my time with my boyfriend who is the loner type). I basically avoid interacting with others out of fear that once I start talking to someone new I will look like I'm about to cry for no reason and they'll think there's something wrong with me.\u00a0\n\nI wasn't always like this. Most of my friends, who I haven't seen since I moved to my new city, would describe me as funny, confident and easygoing. I've only opened up to my boyfriend (who I met in my new city) and one close friend and they were so surprised to hear I was going through this.\n\nJust some background to how this all started:\nAbout 3/4 years ago I was in a bad relationship with a guy who would stress about everything and would make arguments over the smallest of things. It could be something stupid like asking me what I thought was a good tv show and then him going going into great detail about how I was wrong in thinking that. I would ask him to drop it but he would just keep pressing on even when I'd tell him he was stressing me out. He would always challenge me about anything I told him and without fail google it check if I was right. That probably sounds dumb but imagine someone constantly questioning every word that came out of your mouth.\u00a0He made me feel like an idiot even when I was right most of the time. On top of this he was really jealous and always wanted to know who I was with and what I was doing.\n\nBasically I found myself to be in a constant state of stress around him, just waiting on the next argument. He drank a lot as well so this amplied things and often ended up in him just yelling at me over nothing even though I always kept my calm. Occasionally he'd break down into tears over other issues he had. For some stupid reason I decided to move in with him. This is when the panic attacks first started. They would come on with no warning. In the beginning I would have one every few weeks but before I knew it it was several times a day. My heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest, I had tunnel vision, I'd break out in a cold sweat and I was always convinced I was going to faint event though I never did. It was exhausting! I did go to the doctor who just prescribed benzos and diagnosed me with panic disorder.\u00a0\n\nThe benzos did take the edge off the panic attacks but I did end up having to quit my job and not long after that I broke up with my then boyfriend(after putting up with him for a year and a half) and moved to another city. The panic attacks stopped about a week after, I eventually met my current boyfriend (he's awesome) and things were pretty good for me for about a year.\n\nI'm not sure at what point I started to associate anxiety with just talking to people but it happened so gradually I wasn't even aware it had been keeping me from making friends the last 1.5 years. It's been maybe 6 months since I actually started physically showing anxiety symptoms when I talk to people. In my head it doesn't make sense to me to react like this but that doesn't stop it happening.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar before?

We went on to date others and have \"Covid relationships.\"\n\nAfter our previous breakups (his in September and mine in October), we reconnected through Bumble and went on a second first date. The connection felt so natural, so right. It was like we'd known each other for years. \n\nWe were upfront with our intentions. I was not looking to jump into anything quickly after and neither was he. I wanted a natural progression, to do my own thing and work on myself. He was upfront about how he was suffering from mental illness and did not have the capacity to get into anything serious but did not want to give up on our time together. \n\nWe continued the relationship and it turned accidentally exclusive. I was falling for him and we were spending what seemed like every moment together. He was the first man to fully let me open up and be myself. There was no judgement or fear of being authentically myself. I loved this feeling and was excited for what would possibly come next.\n\nFast forward, there was much mis communication because he would tell his friends/family that I was his girlfriend. He was so open with integrating me into his life. I am very private with my friends/family about my relationships because I've never been fully ready to commit to them. I also addressed to him that I was uncomfortable with labels because it can set expectations that I was not ready for. At the same time, I didn't want to lose him so I caved and put the label of girlfriend on myself. \n\nWith the title of girlfriend, lead me to think about our future. He speaks alot about what is next for us. I decided for the very first time that I would introduce him to my friends and then later on family.. \n\nTo note during all this, he had many mental breakdowns due to his panic and anxiety disorders.  This would leave him non-functional for days. I was mindful when helping because I wanted to create healthy boundaries and be there for him without being over bearing. He expressed he needs to deal with things alone to recharge.\n\nIn the last couple days, I could sense his panic and anxiety disorder was getting worst. Then two days ago, one trigger lead a domino affect and breaking up with me. He expressed he needed space and time alone because his panic attack was coming. That we jumped into things too quickly but wants to still see me after he had time to be alone.\n\nWhat should I do? Do I continue to leave him alone? I am not ready to give up on this relationship but I do agree we jumped into things too quickly. I think we both didn't give enough time from our last relationship to now and lead with our hearts.

Not like this anyways.\n\nIt started about two weeks ago. I was home alone and had just ordered food. I made sure to lock the door after collecting whatever I had ordered with delivery.\n\nI went to my room, closed the door to prevent my cats from entering. I played loud music for a bit and then went to sleep. I woke up the next day and the door was unlocked. I got a bit scared because I'm the only one with a copy of the key, but I thought that I just forgot to lock it- shit happens. I didn't really think much about it so I just brushed it off with relative ease.\n\nSame day, at around 6-7 pm, I decided to go to the grocery store. I locked the door, pulled the door to make sure it was locked. The grocery store is about a 5 minute walk, so I just walked there. Now, I'm really indecisive so it still took a good hour to get home again.\n\nI came home and the door was unlocked. I'm so absolutely sure I locked it.\n\nSomeone must have been inside my house. I started shivering, I no longer felt safe in my house. I grabbed a knife and thoroughly searched everywhere and found nobody or nothing missing. The only 'trace' of someone else was some unusual footsteps outside.\n\nSince then I've been so fucking anxious. I look around everywhere in rooms before I enter them, I hallucinate hearing someone walk inside and see stuff that is not there. I've had multiple sleep paralysis and I cannot sleep well at all.\n\nBut... little did I know this was only the beginning.\n\nThese two instances can both be argued to be the fault of me. That nobody was actually inside and I just have bad memory.\n\nSo, about a week later, I had somewhat cooled down. I wasn't as anxious anymore but I was still looking around everywhere whenever I woke up and before I went to bed. \n\nSo I wake up, I roll up the curtains and I see someone on the terrace. They stare at me from the second I saw them, with a really creepy smile. After about 10-15 seconds, they quickly run away to a car nearby and drive off. I was so shocked and confused. I was now, not only anxious; but full out scared for my life. I have no words to describe that feeling.\n\nI'm scared. I don't know what to do.

Sure you feel good after a restful night\u2019s sleep, but its importance goes beyond boosting your mood. Getting enough sleep has direct and positive effects on your weight, heart, mind, and overall well-being.\u00a0\n\nAlthough we all understand the benefits of sleep, the CDC estimates that 1 in every 3 Americans does not get enough sleep. Many factors can be attributed to this epidemic, but one, in particular, stands out.\n\nMany people have low melatonin levels. Nor do they have the know-how to naturally boost melatonin production on their own.\n\nDuring a 24-hour period, each of us produces melatonin, which controls when we go to sleep and when we wake up. This cycle is called the circadian rhythm and it is very sensitive to outside factors. There\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s nearly impossible to get out of bed on a rainy day. Or why many people experience seasonal depression during the winter months. Those who work in front of a computer all day have a hard time falling asleep, as well as those suffering from anxiety.\n\n# How to Increase Your Melatonin, Naturally\n\nWhen melatonin levels are high, you start to feel sleepy. But when levels are low, it can be almost impossible to fall asleep. Thankfully, there are ways to boost your melatonin levels and regain control of your sleep cycle. Let\u2019s take a look at our list of the top 12 natural ways to boost your melatonin levels.\n\n# 1.\u00a0Increase Natural Sunlight Exposure\n\nMost of us wake up in the morning while it\u2019s still dark. We commute to work, park in the parking garage, and sit in an office all day. By the time we make it home, it\u2019s already dark again. By limiting your exposure to natural sunlight, you are confusing your body\u2019s natural clock. Your body thinks it\u2019s supposed to be awake throughout the night and therefore does not know when to produce melatonin.\n\nTry taking time out of your day for a ten-minute walk outside. Aim for the morning hours, but if you are pressed for time, get outside during your lunch break. This will let your body know that it is daytime and will help in resetting your circadian rhythm.\n\n# 2. Go to Bed at A Reasonable Time\n\nMake sure you\u2019re going to bed early enough to get at least 8 hours of sleep. When you stay up late, your body doesn\u2019t produce enough melatonin at the right time. This makes you sleepy in the morning and awake in the evening. This feeling can be very similar to jetlag and can take sometimes days to overcome. Just this slight change in routine can naturally raise your melatonin levels.\n\n# 3. No Artificial Lights at Night\n\nComputer screens, cell phones, light bulbs, and televisions give off what is called blue light. Blue light blocks the production of melatonin. Watching TV or checking your emails in the morning help wake you up, but doing this at night will prevent you from falling asleep.\n\nTry reducing your exposure to artificial lights 2-3 hours before you go to sleep. This will ensure a high melatonin production by the time you go to bed.\n\n# 4. Eat More Melatonin-Rich Foods\n\nEating foods with high amounts of tryptophan will naturally increase melatonin production. Tryptophan is an amino acid that your body does not produce naturally, but it is needed in the production of melatonin. Tryptophan can be found in most foods that contain protein, including almonds, oats, turkey, chicken, and cottage cheese.\n\n# 5. Invest in a Weighted Blanket\n\nAnother great way to naturally boost your melatonin levels is with a weighted blanket. For years, occupational therapists have been using weighted blankets as a therapeutic tool. Weighted blankets put pressure on the body\u2019s sensory receptors, soothing the nervous system and regulating hormone production.\n\nResearchers found that after using a weighted blanket, serotonin levels increased by 28%, and dopamine by 31%. Not only do these \u201chappy hormones\u201d have a positive effect on your mood, but serotonin is directly linked to melatonin production. When serotonin levels are high, melatonin production increases.\n\n# 6. Keep Your Bedroom Dark\n\nThose who work night shifts can appreciate the connection between sunlight and sleep. Trying to go to sleep in the early hours of the morning is a daunting task. Only when their bedroom is dark enough to naturally increase melatonin production, can they fall asleep.\n\nKeep all blinds closed and do not use night lights. When there is too much light in the room, your body thinks it\u2019s daytime and will not produce melatonin.\n\n# 7. Deal with Stress\n\nMelatonin isn\u2019t the only hormone that fluctuates with our sleep and wake schedules. Cortisol, the body\u2019s natural stress hormone, also plays a role in our internal clock. However, cortisol levels fluctuate on an opposite cycle. Production naturally increases during the day and decreases at before bed.\n\nHowever, if you are stressed, cortisol levels remain high and melatonin production cannot start until those levels begin to decrease again. These two hormones become misaligned and your sleep schedule gets thrown off.\n\nTry incorporating meditation, yoga, exercise, or journaling into your daily routine. This will help keep your stress levels under control, which will decrease cortisol levels.\n\n# 8. Cut Down On Caffeine Intake\n\nAlthough we all love a warm cup of coffee in the morning, drinking coffee late in the day actually block melatonin production. Caffeine triggers the body\u2019s \u201cfight or flight\u201d response and increases the stress hormone, cortisol. Drinking too much caffeine can make you irritable, nervous, and unable to fall asleep. These symptoms mimic anxiety symptoms, even in a healthy person.\n\nIf you still want to sip on something warm in the evening, try making the switch to caffeine-free drinks. Chamomile, chai tea, and even lemon water contain natural antioxidants that won\u2019t give you the jitters.\n\n# 9. Eat More Magnesium\n\nMagnesium also naturally boosts your melatonin levels. You can find magnesium in spinach, pumpkin seeds, yogurt, black beans, avocados, and dark chocolate.\n\n# 10.\u00a0Take a Hot Bath or Shower\n\nAnother great way to naturally boost your melatonin levels is to take a hot bath or shower. If you have access to a steam or sauna room, even better! Heat naturally reduces tension in your muscles and boosts neuron activity in your brain. Sweating during a workout, or even laying out in the sun will reduce cortisol levels, allowing your melatonin production to increase.\n\n# 11. Reduce Wi-Fi Exposure at Night\n\nElectromagnetic Fields (EMFs) can be dangerous when exposed for long periods of time. As of today, there is not much research on the effects of Wi-Fi and cell phone radiation. But we do know that exposure to EMFs reduces melatonin production.\n\nAvoid sleeping with your phone next to your head, and if possible, turn off your Wi-Fi at night. This will give your body the chance to produce enough melatonin before you go to sleep.\n\n# 12. Quit Smoking\n\nSmoking cigarettes at night actually reduces the amount of melatonin in your body. If you smoke, try to limit your cigarettes to the morning, or better yet, kick the habit completely. If you need help quitting, consult your doctor.\n\n# Increase Your Melatonin Levels with a Weighted Blanket\n\nDuring a 24-hour period, each of us produces hormones that control when we go to sleep and when we wake up. This cycle is called the circadian rhythm and it is controlled by a hormone called melatonin. Produced in the pineal gland in the brain, this hormone is responsible for your body\u2019s internal clock. When melatonin levels are high, you start to feel sleepy. But when levels are low, it can be almost impossible to fall asleep.\n\nA great way to adjust your sleep schedule is to naturally increase your melatonin levels.\n\n# Why Can\u2019t I Fall Asleep?\n\nThe circadian rhythm it is very sensitive to outside factors. There\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s nearly impossible to get out of bed on a rainy day. Or why many people experience seasonal depression during the winter months. And those who work in front of a computer all day have a hard time falling asleep.\n\nWe know that two major factors naturally affect melatonin production: sunlight and stress. In the evening when the sun starts to set, melatonin production naturally rises. It continues to rise throughout the night and slowly drops when the sun comes up again.\n\nThose who work night shifts can appreciate the connection between sunlight and sleep. Trying to go to sleep in the early hours of the morning is a daunting task. Only when their bedroom is dark enough to naturally increase melatonin production, can they fall asleep.\n\nMelatonin isn\u2019t the only hormone that fluctuates with our sleep and wake schedules. Cortisol, the body\u2019s natural stress hormone, also plays a role in our internal clock. However, cortisol levels fluctuate on an opposite cycle. Production increases during the day and decreases at before bed.\n\nHowever, if you have anxiety symptoms, cortisol levels remain high. This means that melatonin production cannot start until those levels begin to decrease again. These two hormones become misaligned and your sleep schedule gets thrown off.\n\n# What Helps in Increasing Melatonin?\n\nIf left untreated, a thrown-off sleep schedule can greatly affect your quality of life. You\u2019ll find it hard to concentrate. Your production levels at work and school will greatly decrease. A lack of sleep fuels depression and anxiety, making your current situation even worse. Insomnia also has a direct link to weight gain and other serious health issues.\n\nMany people with low melatonin levels take melatonin supplements. Although effective, you should take these supplements in small doses for only a short period of time. They also have side effects such as daytime sleepiness, dizziness, and short-lived depression.\n\nLuckily there are natural ways to increase your melatonin production.\n\nFor years, occupational therapists have been using weighted blankets as a therapeutic tool. Weighted blankets put pressure on the body\u2019s sensory receptors. This added weight soothes the nervous system and regulates hormone production.\n\n# Weighted Blankets &amp; Melatonin\n\nBut how does Deep Pressure Therapy increase your melatonin production? Researchers found that Deep Pressure Therapy increases serotonin levels by 28%, and dopamine by 31%. These \u201chappy hormones\u201d have a positive effect on your mood and are directly linked to melatonin production.\n\nThe brain uses serotonin to make melatonin. This means that when serotonin levels are high, melatonin levels are elevated as well. Researchers also found that deep pressure significantly decreases cortisol levels. After applying deep pressure, cortisol levels dropped by 31%.\n\nThe effects of this natural realignment are huge. Not only will this positively affect your quality of sleep, but your quality of life as well. Investing in a weighted blanket is a great way to naturally increase your melatonin levels.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBy making these small adjustments and investing in a weighted blanket, you can naturally boost your melatonin production and get a better night's sleep. You can regain control of your sleep schedule, without the side effects of other sleeping aids. You deserve to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning.\n\nIf you have any questions or other ideas on how to naturally increase melatonin production, please comment below!", "title": "Top 12 Natural Ways to Boost Your Melatonin Production"}, {"created_utc": 1617953189, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mnbzld/can_i_take_my_anxiety_medication_whenever/", "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place to post this but just looking for some advice! \n\nI have struggled with anxiety for 13 years and started having panic attacks about 2 years ago. \nI\u2019ve been on medication for over a year but stopped taking it for a while because of pregnancy. \n\nI\u2019ve just been put back on the medication yesterday, more so to help me sleep, but I\u2019m having a bad day today. \n\nI\u2019ve been really anxious all day and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m able to take my medication now so as to prevent it getting worse or should I wait until my normal time of taking it? \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!", "title": "Can I take my anxiety medication whenever?"}, {"created_utc": 1617952909, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mnbxa9/driving_road_test_tomorrow/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have pretty bad anxiety and tmrw I have my road test I know I\u2019m a good driver and can do it but I\u2019m just scared of having a panic attack mid test or something any tips on how to calm down?

I decided to make this little project on reddit in which I'll share with you my experience with CBT on detail hoping that it could help some of you, as I've been feeling a lot better since I started therapy. If this post gets some interest from you, I'm going to continue posting my experiences session by session. I'll be sharing with you everything that my therapist tells me, and I'll be answering doubts too. Sorry, but these are going to be long posts. Hope you guys enjoy.\n\n\nWell, first, I'll start by telling you a little bit about myself. I've been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder since I was 19 y.o. but I'm pretty sure I had this since I was 7. I grew up in a very competitive family. My father is a civil engineer with master's degree and a Ph. D. So he's pretty smart and also he has a good job and we live well. He was so hard on me when I was a kid. I was never able to make him proud. He was never surprised by my accomplishments, never told me kind words. He was an absent father, always working and never caring. I'm the older brother of 3 so pressure was hard on me. I had to be the mature one, the leader, the protector. My cousins are older than me, and back in the day they always made fun of me, they treated me badly and they bullied me hard. I was never able to have any real friends. I got bullied to a point where I felt like sh*t and had to be aggressive in order to feel safe, so I became a bully myself. Long story short: I was always anxious and without friends, I mean... I had friends, and close friends, but our relationships were always chaotic, and I escaped from my life through videogames since I was 7. I used to play videogames for hours and hours. Now I'm 27 and haven't finished college. Depression and anxiety crippled me and made me unable to focus on college, even though my gpa is high, and I'm considered to be an excellent student. I feel like a failure because of my age and because I'm still in college... My life was supposed to be so different.\n\nNow let's talk about the first therapy session. My therapist is a young woman, almost a girl. She's about my age, let's call her Monica. Now I'm taking one session of 1 hour a week with her. One of the things that I like about her is that she has the same disorder than me, General Anxiety Disorder, so she understands very well what an anxious person goes through. She focuses mainly on treating anxiety disorders.\n\nIn the first session, she started by asking me why did I decided to take therapy. I told her that I was diagnosed with GAD and that it got worse in the last 2 years, that I was unable even to get out of bed, that I got very overweight and that my life was practically a mess. She asked me what I expect to accomplish and I told her that I wanted to manage my anxiety, to improve my social life and to live happier. She said that it was completely possible so we started the first session.\n\n This first session was all about her asking me about my environment, my family, my friends and how was my relationship with them. I told her that I have 2 brothers and I also live with my parents. I told her that I don't get along very well with my brothers, we barely see each other at dining time and, because we 3 are males, we're kind of manly and we tease each other very much, to a point that it's unhealthy. I also said that I think my brothers hate me because I bullied them when we were kids. I also told her that I kind of despise my parents, because my mother is so damn obsessed about cleaning (she cleans all day and she also expects that we all clean) to a point that I think it's sick. She comes from a family in which they were all women and they used to leave their house spotless. Women with small jobs that clean all day, so she expect us to be the same; our house needs to be spotless everyday and it's frustrating how desperate my mom gets about cleaning. My father got stomach cancer about 3 years ago and was close to dying, but he survived and now there's no trace of cancer in his body, but doctors had to remove his stomach, so now his live is completely different, he eats so little and gets tired very much through all the day. He's a very tough guy, he never shares his feelings and he speaks badly about other people. He's egocentric and treats people like sh*t because he's successful and others aren't. I kinda despise my parents because they allowed this to happen to me, because they didn't take proper care of me when I was a kid and they had no interest in my mental health, even though there were clear signs that I was not ok. \n\nShe then she asked me about my daily routine. I told her that I play videogames from 10 pm till 5 am and I sleep from 5 am till 1 or 2 pm. I eat, I don't shower or brush my teeth, I'm on my smartphone almost all day  inside my room. I feel anxious all the time, I don't know the day I live in and I don't remember who I was before... I feel like I'm becoming crazy. Nevertheless, I workout for about 1 hour a day with some dumbbells, because I'm trying to lose some weight. Also I stopped drinking fizzy drinks and eating junk food. But I used to eat them regularly. She told me \"Ok, first thing's first, we need to separate what's anxiety and what's not. Even though you sleep a lot, you don't sleep in the night and that's physically incorrect. We humans are programmed to sleep at night and if we sleep in the day we don't recover energy properly. So... Let's think like A+B+C= D. We're experiencing a pandemic crisis, you don't sleep well, plus you're anxious. You see? You're not becoming crazy, what you're experiencing is normal given your routine\". I told her that I was planning to change my sleeping and gaming habits and that I was going to make it right away. \n\nThis was the first session. It was really more a consult than a therapy session. She was only starting to get to know me. She told me that my next appointment would be next week and she sent me some quesitionaries through WhatsApp for me to fill. Questionaries included some questions about my health, about who I was in touch with and if I took therapy before. She also made me sign a document that stated things like \"there's no warranty on therapy working\", very standard.\n\nFor the next days I quitted gaming cold turkey and I also started to sleep at 12 pm, and woke up at 8 am. It worked. I felt a lot better. My mind wasn't as foggy as it used to be and the sensation of me becoming crazy got better. I was still anxious all the time, and I still felt like sh*t but I felt kind of better.\n\nSpoiler alert: what really helped me was session 2! I learned so much and felt a lot better afterwards... I'll tell you about it in my next post, if you guys want to.\n\nWell, now all I want to say is, I'm conscious that we're all different and therapy is customized, so I know maybe these posts won't be helpful to some of you.

What if it just all comes out wrong and suddenly I sound like an ass. What if I am an ass? Maybe I am an ass and thats why it's better to stay quiet. Its making me miserable though. I love people, I love going out and I love my friends and it hurts because I've lost connections because I'm too afraid to try to talk anymore and am afraid of being adventurous enough anymore. I'm also terrified. I'm old enough to consider kids and thats insanely terrifying. I think the fact that I want a fuller life makes me more terrified of being restricted to another life. Just taking care of pets are overwhelming. I don't think I want anymore obligations I just want to live but how do I live when I am constantly quivering in fear, from speaking, living and bearly breathing. With these thoughts sometimes I feel so compressed I can bearly move and because of it I don't think I am moving and I'm just existing for the sake of it.", "title": "Overloaded"}, {"created_utc": 1617942689, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mn9l0e/at_what_point_is_your_anxiety_likely/", "num_comments": 8, "score": 1, "selftext": "Title says it all", "title": "At what point is your anxiety likely schizophrenia?

My parents became pretty big smokers around this time and would smoke carts to help them sleep. (This account is actually my dads that I am just borrowing) I began to do the same before I would go to sleep every so often and it would just make me sleep like a baby. A little paranoia here and there but nothing crazy.\n\n4 nights ago I was smoking on a cart (Butterscotch was the strain) before I went to sleep and took about 4-5 hits (I usually take about 1-2 hits and that\u2019ll knock me out) because I felt like it wasn\u2019t hitting hard and I wasn\u2019t feeling anything. I plugged it up to the charger for about 5 minutes and then took 2 more hits that felt better and then closed my eyes to fall asleep. I started to feel pretty paranoid and just brushed it off but it quickly began to ramp up harder than it ever had before so I just jumped into the shower to try to cool down. The shower helped at first and I began to calm down but as quickly as it ramped up before it started again. Thoughts of \u201cWhat did I do to myself?\u201d \u201cWhat if this lasts for forever?\u201d Washed over me. Full blown panic attack ensued. I couldn\u2019t breathe, everything felt doomed, easily the scariest moment of my life. I jumped out of the shower and had to wake up my parents. I couldn\u2019t get the words out so I just googled weed-induced panic attack and just handed them the phone. I told them I knew it was a panic attack and I knew it would pass but it\u2019s terrifying for the moment I feel so hopeless, all while sobbing. They calmed me down and I was able to fall asleep about 2 hours later. \n\nFast forward 3 days to now and I just feel so strange. I\u2019ve looked up countless articles, Reddit posts, success stories, YouTube videos, etc and I know that several people have experienced something similar. I just figured it would help outlining my own experience to vent and receive replies specific to me. I understand that depersonalization and derealization are 2 of the most common forms of anxiety following a panic attack. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2019 and was prescribed Adderall that helped but the side effects were kind of annoying and I could function decently without it anyways so I just didn\u2019t take it and moved on with life aside from a few times here and there if I really needed to focus on something. Waking up the day after the attack I felt ok but as the day progressed I realized everything still just felt so strange. Not near the same degree as the actual panic attack but everything just felt so bleak and I couldn\u2019t really sleep as I would begin to just overthink it. I took my Adderall and it felt better I was even able to get a little bit of sleep which I can\u2019t usually do while the Adderall is active. I woke up and felt much better with a little trouble falling asleep that night but otherwise an improvement. I woke up the next day and immediately took my Adderall and was fine most of that day as well. I was still thinking about it throughout the day but it wasn\u2019t effecting me near as much.  Day 3 I woke up and wanted to try the day without the Adderall as a dependency on a drug to function is something I\u2019m a little apprehensive of. This day was noticeably worse which I figured it would be but it really ramped up when nighttime came, my friends had hopped offline, and I laid down to go to sleep. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about if this would ever stop. My thoughts were just racing. Thoughts of how I felt before the attack versus how I felt now. Just the worst anxiety I\u2019ve ever had, it just made my head hurt. I tried breathing exercises, grounding techniques, nothing was working so I went back to parents and just had them help me again. \n\nI\u2019m writing this the day after that night while on my Adderall. I want to note that during all three of these days I vigorously researched it. I understand symptoms like these are expected/normal after a severe panic attack as I said previously. I do not think I am experiencing depersonalization at-least how I see it described (birds-eye view of my own body). However, derealization and just awful anxiety are what I think I\u2019m dealing with. Most of the posts I saw of people experiencing something similar said that it would go away in time and I trust it will, it is just hard to reaffirm that to myself at the height of the anxiety.\nAt its worst it\u2019s feels truly truly awful and makes my head physically hurt. I will say that last night is by far the most sleep have gotten as I tried the recommended method of just accepting it. I told myself it\u2019s not going to go away right now and I have to sleep so I\u2019m going to sleep. I slept pretty good about 10 hours waking up 3 times but much better than the previous 2 nights. I woke up with anxiety ramping up pretty quickly so I just popped my Adderall within an hour of waking up. I also want to add that before the attack I was pretty normal, some normal stress and anxiety about life but nothing that I thought was excessive at all. I have felt similarly only once before after a breakup in 2017, not to the same degree at all but it\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve felt like I was dealing with anxiety/depression in my life. Other than that I can usually take things on the chin and keep going.\n\nI know this is a bit scatter-brained and if you read this far I appreciate it. I guess just any reassurance to my specific situation would me AMAZING and just some answered questions like: Am I okay to take my Adderall everyday and ride this out seeing as it was prescribed to me? (I\u2019ve also read that ADHD can make this situation harder to deal with.) I\u2019m in the process of being re-added to parents insurance so I can not consult a doctor/psychiatrist/therapist just yet. Has anyone else had a very similar experience? If so, what helped the most? Were the symptoms as prominent for you? Even while during something else? (Watching TV, Video Games, etc) How long did this last for you or someone you may know? \n\nSorry for the rant, any help is greatly appreciated.", "title": "Weed-induced panic attack really effecting me"}, {"created_utc": 1640238086, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/rmof9j/parents_and_mental_illness/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "For context, my parents are 65 year old Catholics, and I'm a 28 year old Buddhist.

Keep in mind i have done this about 3 times without any problems.\n\nOne thing i must note about my sleep is that every time i sleep i would fall into this state where as am im about to fall asleep my body wakes me up very abruptly making my heart race like ive just woken up from a nightmare. I belive this is called a Hypnogogic jerks in a scientific definition. But anyways this irregualar sleep pattern has been happening throughout my life from what i can remember. \n\nSo when i took a medium sized hit (maybe like 2-3 puffs) and layed down on my bed to sleep, of course with my luck, i get a hypnic jerk during the stages of me being high. This resulted in the most horrific panic attack i have ever experienced. Shit was so bad it makes me panic just by thinking of it right now. Keep in mind i did have 1 panic attack previously but is was not as bad as the one where i was high. So the next day i felt extremely sick, i had a headache, felt nauseous, dizzy, etc. couple days after that i had to go camping which i told my parents i was not feeling to well to go  but they insisted. As we are going to the highway i start to get a panic attack and have shortness of breath which then we drove to the hospital. Had to wait 8 hrs just for a doctor to tell me it was cuz of covid and how people are anxious of the virus(screw hospitals). Ever since then ive been getting panic attacks here and there but not everyday. But whats weird is the the panic attacks ive experienced are quite weird from a normal panic attack. When the episode comes i feel extremely nervous and anxious, distressed, have cold shivers but would never have an increased heart rate or shortness of breath. I know this because Ive kept tracked of my heart rate during the attacks via smart watch. They where always between 60-100 bpm which is the normal heart rate in a resting state. And because of this when i went to do a electrocardiogram test and they said that everything was normal. But i would still have these modified panic attacks. \n\nFast forward to the present, and now i believe most of my panic attacks are triggered from my stomach but a couple from my mental state. Then as things couldn't get any worse, a week ago i had a little too much chocolate which caused and acid reflux in my stomach which caused a very baaad panic attack but like previously mentioned it was one of those weird modified panic attacks. Now not only do i have to worry about my panic attacks, i am now diagnosed with GER also known as gastroesophageal reflux all cause i had a hypnic jerk during me being high. And what i find most funny is that the flavour of weed is called god's gift. Is this god's gift in giving me a half a year of sufferings? I got no clue when i will be able to function properly again.

I completely understand WHY he feels the way he does but i have no idea how to help other than offer sympathy which isn\u2019t enough. His symptoms (common symptoms like disassociation, heavy breathing, increased heart rate, extreme emotions etc) can be triggered by seemingly anything. Sometimes we can just be walking through a store by ourselves and I\u2019ll see him completely shut down. I don\u2019t want my brother to always be struggling as much and it\u2019s clear that recently it\u2019s been really getting to him as he\u2019s gone back to repeating some bad habits to cope. I have tried to talk to him about what triggers him but he\u2019s stated he doesn\u2019t like to talk about his feelings. He\u2019s in counseling but he\u2019s only able to go a couple times a month.

Ways I have tried to help is I guess basic stuff, like asking him what\u2019s wrong/ when he appears very stressed and offering comfort by listening or doing small tasks for him (like making him some tea or helping him clean his room). He\u2019s mentioned that he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019ll understand his anxiety and I\u2019m worried my attempts at helping are furthering those beliefs. He also believes that i\u2019m disappointed in him which is completely  untrue but no matter how many times I try to tell him he always circles back to it .\n\nShould I back off?

They know this about all of us, but choose to bring them anyway. My mom won\u2019t ask them not to bring them because 1. My mom is extremely non confrontational and 2. my aunt is extremely sensitive and would have her feelings hurt. My mom has expressed that my daughter is terrified of them but that changed nothing. They don\u2019t have children if their own, so I understand that they consider the dogs their children, but they fail to see what a burden it is for the rest of the family. The real issue comes into play with my dad. He doesn\u2019t have the best relationship with my aunt and her partner for several reasons I won\u2019t get into, but they are cordial and things go smoothly enough when they come for a visit and the dogs do not come.

So far, my head is crazily stuffed up, lots of snots going on, I gotta cough, little congestion, feeling real rundown.. feels like a bad cold, but there\u2019s also lots of weird headaches, a little gastro issues, been feeling real nauseas after I eat for a little bit, and I get hit with these big waves of dizzy spells and vertigo.

It all started 3 years ago. I was in my second last year of school, and I met this girl, she was very friendly, and had the kindest heart, we started as friends, and became close pretty quickly, however I slowly started to fall for her however she had a boyfriend, and that\u2019s when the anxiety started.\n\nAt first it would just make me lose my appetite when I thought about her, then It got to the point where I couldn\u2019t eat around her properly and I started making excuses that I wasn\u2019t hungry or I was feeling sick. I made it set in my mind that I physically couldn\u2019t eat around her which I think made it worse for myself. Eventually it got to the point where it would no longer be losing my appetite, I would actually start to feel nauseas at the thought of just seeing her in the morning at school. At this point I decided it would be best to tell her, she was accepting and kind about it, but I don\u2019t think she really understood it.\n\nThis did help for a while, however after a few weeks the thoughts started to cloud my mind again, and I would quickly get nauseas at the thought of just seeing her, this did start to effect our relationship. I should point out that she was very forward and touchy with me, we\u2019d hug a lot and at one point she accidentally went for a kiss goodbye which she quickly realised and ran away embarrassed. However I had told her I had feelings for her due to this and she did not feel the same. \n\nAt this point, I would constantly get nauseas if we had plans to hangout and a lot of time physically be sick which would take away the nausea for a little while but then it would come back. Eventually after a year and half we both finished school and she moved away, so we didn\u2019t see each other anymore, and I thought I would be fine.\n\nI was for a while, but I didn\u2019t do much to cause any anxiety, however once I started university, I was anxious in the mornings but fine after a few hours, and I\u2019m not the best at socialising but I could talk to people, even girls to an extent. But if it came to actually making a relationship, even a friendship the thought terrified me, and made me feel horrible in my stomach. Which in turn caused me to hide and runaway from relationships, even though I\u2019d love to meet someone and make a relationship. \n\nFast forward to March this year i got invited to a party by my friend, and it was the first time I\u2019d ever been to one with only one other person I knew, anyway I was a bit nervous, but I thought I could do it. At the party I met this girl who we both sort of hit it off and spoke, but my anxiety was attacking me, and I had to find a way to escape to run to the bathroom multiple times. I made friends with the girl, and we talk a lot, and we both actually share similar anxiety issues, which helps, but I still struggled to cope. \n\nI decided at this point it would be best to speak to a professional, to which I got an appointment with a psychiatrist, who I spoke to and he prescribed me meds, which made me feel full of confidence again. However when it came to actually using them, they didn\u2019t really feel like they helped. This made me a take a really bad turn for the worst, because I always told myself it\u2019s fine I\u2019ll just speak to a doctor and get medicine and be fine, and now I don\u2019t have that to fall back on anymore and it really terrifies me. \n\nI tried to make a follow up appointment with my psychiatrist however, he kept telling me we would make one and talk soon, which was fine, but never happened and the last message I sent he just ignored, so I kind of gave up on him. \n\nI feel like my anxiety is getting worse though, I recently got a haircut where I dyed my hair, and it took all my willpower not to be sick and run off, I don\u2019t even know what caused it, I think it was the thought of \u201coh no, what if I have to be sick\u201d.  And even more recently, I was supposed to go to a fancy restaurant with my best friend and my other closest friend who I\u2019ve never had problems with when it comes to that, and I couldn\u2019t do it and that also really scared me. \n\nI tried contacting another professional to speak to, but I never got a response, maybe because it\u2019s Christmas period, but I really don\u2019t know what to do anymore, I\u2019m scared I don\u2019t want it to get worse, I want to meet new people and make new friends. \n\nI know this is really long, and I don\u2019t know who or if anyone will read it all, but i would really appreciate just some advice or tips if anyone has got any.

I\u2019m sharing what I feel in hopes of finding people who are diagnosed and who experience/d these symptoms, so that I can learn more about it. If I could afford a psychiatrist, therapist or go see a counselor (my school doesn\u2019t have one) I would. \n\nI just want to know what I could possibly have, what disorder or illness so that I can look for tips online to manage and keep it together until I get professional help.\n\nI\u2019m a 16 year old girl, I don\u2019t smoke, drink or do any delinquent activities, and I\u2019ve never been to therapy or been diagnosed with a mental illness before. My mom had severe OCD though.\n\nFor the past 2 years, I\u2019ve been feeling like people (who I don\u2019t personally know, could be celebrities or people I used to like or just random people in general) are watching me at home when I\u2019m by myself or with my family, and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities: Going to the toilet? Gross. Preparing a meal? You\u2019re doing it the wrong way. Praying? Ridiculous (?) Dressing in a certain way? What the hell are you wearing. Taking a selfie? You\u2019re not pretty/you look foolish. Listening to music? Your taste sucks. Reading a certain book (on wattpad)? What are you, 9? They basically ridicule literally everything I do. \n\n\n&gt;&gt; The thing is, sometimes I feel like those people could see me through my eyes. It\u2019s like they\u2019re inside me, but they\u2019re not at the same time. That\u2019s why I do things in the dark, to block my vision so that they can\u2019t see me. Literally every possible normal thing. \n\n\nI don\u2019t hear them or see them. I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re speaking either. I only imagine them in ly head, I\u2019m aware of that, except I can\u2019t stop acting weird \u201caround them\u201d.\n\nI started doing some some extremely normal stuff in the dark (like going to the toilet with lights off) so that they can\u2019t see me. I\u2019m worried about what they think or that they\u2019re laughing at me to the point that I don\u2019t even enjoy stuff I used to. And I even started talking to myself as if I was making clarifications and justifications to them regarding what I\u2019m doing. For example, I could say \u201cEw, that\u2019s really gross.\u201d which will match what *they think of me* therefore they\u2019d think it\u2019s out of my control and won\u2019t judge me for it.\n\nI was literally just doing the dishes in nothing but a very dim light. Doing the dishes. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think these are exactly hallucinations but I sometimes see shadows with the corner of my eye, but I think it\u2019s just as normal as mistaking a pile of clothes for a ghost.\n\nThose are details that I feel like I would list if I had a therapist:\n\n\nI have violent mood swings that occur very often in a day, could be each 6 hours or each 30 minutes. Maybe even every 2 days. Nothing triggers these mood swings though. \n\nThese mood swings do not result in me harming myself in any way, however. \n\nI also randomly switch from feeling very hyperactive to having no motivation whatsoever.\n\nI forget very, very often that I have to write down things on my hand or pieces of paper to remember them.\n\nI have very intense feelings (especially hate and sadness) and an occasional fear of abondamment.\n\nI overthink.\n\nI get crippling anxiety thoughts.\n\nAlso, I thought I\u2019d say this because maybe it could be my potential mental disorder manifesting itself: I used to create fake profiles for no malicious intentions whatsoever, except to make friends and experiencing what life would be like if I was that person, as I\u2019ve endured a long history of bullying from my own family and friends. It\u2019s a form of escapism. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ugly and tbh, I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m pretty many times, I have my insecurities, but this isn\u2019t why I did it. I don\u2019t seem to know why I feel the need to do so, really.\n\n\nSomeone suggested I have social anxiety but I don\u2019t act weird around actual people. I\u2019m perfectly fine in crowds. I\u2019m only anxious around those inexistent people. I read a lot about it online and I think I either have paranoia (I don\u2019t believe anyone wants to harm me) or some schizophrenic/schizo\u00efde/schizoaffective disorder. \n\nIt\u2019s taking over my life and my parents believe everything can be cured by following the path of god or whatever and don\u2019t take my mental health seriously, and I can\u2019t afford therapy myself. Please provide any helpful opinions.\n\nAs I said I\u2019m well aware you aren\u2019t professionals. I\u2019m just gathering information and opinions to look for methods to maybe reduce these symptoms until I can afford therapy. \n\nI know I\u2019m a minor, but I\u2019m sadly a part of a society that doesn\u2019t prioritize mental health for kids nor adults or teens, there\u2019s so much stigma surrounding it. \n\nIf there\u2019s any therapist in this subreddit who\u2019s willing to only direct me to the right path so I could have accurate information, (I\u2019m not asking for treatment), I\u2019d highly appreciate that.\n\nTake care.", "title": "please, some opinion/input on my situation (i\u2019ll take what you say with a grain of salt.) what am i possibly experiencing?"}, {"created_utc": 1640214125, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/rmh6uy/this_will_sound_insane/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I was watching tiktok and I came across a video that was like \u2018Things husbands say to their wife\u2019s with cancer\u2019 and I thought it was like a sarcastic thing, because one of them was \u2018Everyone gets stomach pain sometimes\u2019 and I thought it was sarcastic as in, the man trying to be sympathetic but being really not supportive if that makes sense?\n\nI laughed at it, Thinking it was sarcastic then realised the rest of the video and the comments were NOT.

I haven\u2019t done that since I was like 12 lol. Even though I made great progress, the problem is I used alcohol and nicotine as a coping mechanism. I use to despise drinking when I was a marijuana smoker and I quit vaping for awhile cause I was afraid of covid and tripped out about my lungs/ heart.

It seems to have gotten to a tipping point recently for me and after a couple of ER visits that proved to ultimately be intense panic attacks. \n\nThe panic attacks alone were not the reason I decided to seek help, as I have been stumbling through prior scenarios as well as I can, and I'm pretty forgetful when it comes to putting myself first. What really made up my mind is that I apparently have dangerously high blood pressure during these episodes, and I've been told it's very unusual for my age (last visit they recorded the higher number at 210, I don't remember the low) \n\nThis is my first PCP that I've ever gone to as an adult, and never really have had experiences with doctors when I was young, so all of this is extremely new to me. The PCP I saw today was very kind, but really didn't try to give a diagnosis or pry into what may be going on with me. It made me uncomfortable that he was willing to just throw a couple of prescriptions at me without really trying to understand what's going on with me.

I told him about my ADHD symptoms and about my ER visits, and he didn't seem too much more interested than that, before just tossing a couple meds at me. Like I said before, he was a kind person and seemed to be concerned with my issues, it's just the lack of any sort of real investigation that threw me off. \n\nI've been extremely afraid of medications because I really don't want to put myself in a situation that makes me more unstable, as I'm not sure if I can handle it. I've gone on living in this condition up until now with quite a bit of struggle, and I just don't want get it wrong with my already volatile chemistry. Every day is difficult, but I've still managed to seem believably happy-go-lucky and connected with everyone around me in a positive way. It's just when I'm alone away from work or close friends that I start to lose myself, but I always tend to land back on a decent enough footing to make it through the next day. I know help is needed but I can't get over how afraid I am to plunge further down unintentionally. \n\nI will say that I am not exactly doing myself any favors in regards to health, but I'm pretty convinced this issue is beyond diet and habits. I do drink, and I don't maintain a super healthy diet, but I do try. My work is pretty physical and I have great relationships with most people, as well as close friends to confide in. \n\nI'm supposed to start taking welbutrin tomorrow and am just really apprehensive because I am pretty aware of the negative affects if it's not a good fit. Any advice is appreciated and I'm not looking for diagnosis. I'm just throwing this out there hoping that maybe someone who has felt similar could give input and maybe help me make a decision. \n\nThanks a ton.", "title": "Finally got a PCP and prescription for help.

It tends to get so bad that I could be right in the middle of a depressive episode and still berate myself because I'm not really depressed. The result is that I have sudden lightbulb moments where I see myself the same way a stranger would and it's suddenly so clear that I have symptoms of depression/anxiety and more. So I'm happy I noticed this.\n\nFor example, I noticed today that I tend to obsessively rewrite and check things in fear that they are not correct. This checking often makes me put more pressure on myself to do \"the thing\" and causes more avoidance. As a result, the need for the thing to be perfect delays my ability to do it on time. E.g. I was texting someone today and, feeling anxious about their perception about me, I pre-drafted all of the messages and edited them before sending them. I made a minor mistake (accidentally showed evidence of my drafting behaviors) and now feel so much shame. I will likely spend all night thinking about it until they text me back. Even if I try to forget it, it will be in the back of my head. \n\nOther examples are obsessive journaling (sometimes many hours a day, feeling the need to capture what I am thinking, therapist told me I need to lay off), obsessively checking my appearance and feeling hyperaware of my body when I go anywhere other than walking the dog, reading emails 10-20 times before sending. I am often late seeing my friends bc I get trapped changing in and out of clothes in front of the mirror. Anything that I sense has high stakes re other people judging me (social anxiety), I have these behaviors. This happens with forecasting a lot. I tend to forecast extremely far into the future about how things will go wrong. I am very aware those things will NOT happen, it's not even possible bc it's so far in the future, yet I can't stop myself from panicking over imagined events. \n\nEven here! You see how much I'm writing. I have another account where I write like this constantly. I sometimes spend multiple hours drafting a post. I do something similar in my journal. I write extremely long replies to people and keep editing them just in case I've forgotten to include something. \n\nIt's weird bc I also do this thing where I will obsessively read something important to me until it loses it's meaning, then I feel discontented. If that makes sense? E.g. I have a lot of trouble validating that I experienced abuse as a child. If someone, such as my therapist, confirms my experience, I will obsessively think about what she said until it loses it's meaning. Like I will suck it of its validating powers. Once that happens, I no longer believe what she said and will quickly go back to believing the abuse didn't happen (no internal validation). \n\nI'm just grateful most of these behaviors are not debilitating for me. I can't imagine how difficult it is for many of you who have to deal with obsessions/compulsions that affect your daily life. I'm just surprised at my own inability to see the disordered thinking in things I've been doing for YEARS, despite constantly thinking about symptoms. I'm just worried. I'm hoping to eventually work with people who suffer from anxiety in the future, I'd like to be a clinician, but I question my ability to help people if I spend my life overwhelmed by my own anxiety.

It could make things inconvenient for us or worsen our already shaky relationships. But when others use us as tools, constantly belittle us, or someone is making our lives worse, we have no choice but to deal with them head-on. There\u2019s no way around it,  and since I know how tough facing your fears can be, I\u2019m going to give you some advice.\n\n## Redefine your idea of confrontation\n\nWhen you think about facing others,  you probably think, \u201cNothing good ever comes from speaking up; it just  makes things worse.\u201d Your head gets filled with streams of negative concepts about conflict. But why? From where do these perceptions come?  What\u2019s the worst that could happen if you choose to stand up for yourself now? Challenge your thoughts and decide if confrontation is the monster you think it is.\n\n## Start with someone friendly\n\nTackling your enemies is a huge undertaking, so start small and gain more confidence before putting yourself out there. Start by confronting people who you **know** won\u2019t lash out at you for speaking your mind. They can be your loved ones or perhaps passerby you meet on the street. Have a conversation with them and point out something small they do that bothers you. Just don\u2019t be *overly* harsh, or you might get in a heated argument over something trivial. As you get more used to speaking up, you can move on to substantial issues.\n\n## Focus more on how it affects you rather than how bad the other person is\n\nIf you\u2019re excessively accusatory, it might seem as though you\u2019re just trying to point your finger at someone. So to get your point across,  stick with statements about yourself \u2014 \u201cI feel disrespected when you  talk smack about me behind my back.\u201d Avoid demonizing the other person \u2014  \u201cYou\u2019re such an a\\*\\*hole! All you do is gossip and get off to ruining my  reputation!\u201d Instead of bickering back and forth, let the other person hear your feelings. That will provide for a more open conversation, and will allow for a sleeker understanding of each other.", "title": "How to Stop Avoiding Confrontation"}, {"created_utc": 1632275230, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/psx9rz/please_help_find/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Im having a literal breakdown.

Together with practicing mindfulness, going on walks during sunrise and sunset, eating healthier food, avoiding alcohol, and getting as much sleep at night as I can have really got me the closest to feeling back to normal.  However, if I miss a day or have a rest day schedule, or the weather doesn't allow me to go on a walk or even if the weekend trips up my daily routing than the anxiety comes flowing in and I end up in a downward spiral for a few days or weeks until I can gather myself and start all over again. \n\nI guess what I am wondering is it always like this?

Soooo, I apologize if this is long because I'm basically pouring my heart into this and FINALLY saying whatever is on my mind.\n\nSo for context, I never experienced anxiety or depression much besides me overthinking or occasionally worrying about stupid things like my Mom not coming home on time. However, I reached my current sophomore year of high school. Hell. I think the pandemic definitely contributed a lot of darkness to my mental health as well. I used to be extremely social, known as the \"Gay Best Friend\" who would always make everybody laugh and have tons of friends. I still do have friends, but a small circle and now I find it *extremely* difficult to make new friends without the blatant awkwardness involved.. And I can't specifically remember when I started having immense anxiety but it began I believe a little after I started smoking weed regularly (using dab pens almost 5 times a week, only a few hits though and I would get high). I started to be very paranoid when I was high, my heart would beat out of my chest and I would have almost like \"voices in my head\" which obviously led to me thinking I had Schizophrenia or another serious mental illness. It feels as if I *can't* stop thinking or stressing over things. However, I soon realized that it was just my thoughts and they would be CONSTANT thoughts and I doubt this has anything to do with anxiety and I'm just rambling at this point and I sound stupid. This is exactly what I mean-- I can't talk about my anxiety and have the ability to \"put it all in words.\" I feel as if I'm the only person that understands and I sort of.. confide in myself? \n\nAnyways, I constantly stress over things that other people tell me do not matter. It seems so simple to live a care-free, relaxing life but I can't. I have a consistent fear of growing up as well, whether it's the future or college plans, etc. I consider myself to be mature for my age, having researched colleges since I was 13. I think that my intelligence and knowledge of.. the world.. also is a factor in my anxiety. I have a fear of having a low-income when I'm older like my family.. I have a fear of not having a single-dorm in college because of my snoring.. and the list goes on and on and on until I get a stress headache and have to force myself to breathe and stop. I feel like I am burning my brain out with all of these worries, and I'm only 15, almost 16, years old. I can't keep going on like this, but my Mom, who is a single parent after I stopped contact with my alcoholic dad, doesn't want me to start medication because I am so young. I agree, though. I've researched some medicine and I don't want to be zombie-like or gain weight, as body dysmorphia and feeling that I am ugly is already a key part of my **lavish** mental health. I have fears of me dying young, of death in general, and everything that I do I correlate it to my fears. I'm gay, so I constantly stress over being judged so before I meet anyone new, I go through the usual heart racing and palms sweating situation. I do not let my friends invite guys I don't know to hang out with us-- men, in general, are a no-no to me, I feel as if everybody is homophobic until I get to meet them and know them. This mindset is horrible and I wish I could change it.\n\nAdditionally, I stress *for* other people. My mom's job doesn't give her a pension so she told me she's going to have to work until the day she dies. Don't even get me started on death. Once my mom dies I feel as if there's going to be no purpose in life. I have my brothers and a lot of aunts and uncles too, but I've been such a mommy's boy my whole life considering the \"daddy issues\" I've had since I was 5 years old. She also drinks a whole bottle of wine per day constantly, which scares me. Yeah, she's about 50 but she always says how her body hurts and I get scared for her health. She's been smoking for many years as well, and that leads me to ANOTHER fear of mine, the fact that I vape. I've been vaping since I was fourteen, which is SO young. I don't stress about it until I put it in retrospect and realize the number of pods that I've used (which are probably 3-4 a week, one pod being equivalent to a pack of cigarettes) and I'm only 15. I'm destroying my body with the vaping, the hitting probable laced carts off of dab pens, and the stress of everything messing with my brain.\n\nMy mom offered for me to see a therapist, but I just don't want to be a burden on her. Sometimes, sessions can be up to $100 each and I just can't do that, especially not with her spending problems. We order food every night because my mom has no energy to cook, considering her depression. I usually clean up the house, do the dishes, etc. and this adds so much stress to me because it's just more and more things that *I* have to get done. And it just leads me to think that.. when I go to college.. who's going to help out with my mom? She wants to move across the country practically but I want to stay here for college-- which is once again, another stress of mine. \n\nI've also struggled with derealization and depersonalization issues and the whole conversation of an \"afterlife\" gets my heart pumping, and not in a good way. (TW) Suicidal thoughts as well have come across, but I know I would never for the sake of my mom.. and my fear of death/afterlife. I just cannot see myself living past 18, \"adulting\" is extremely scary to me with taxes, being alone, having no love life because I'm gay with insecurities, etc. My whole life is a blur and it's scaring me. I'm 15 - I should be out having fun and enjoying my last few teenage years. Instead, I'm bottled up in my room half of the time constantly worrying.\n\nI'm so sorry for rambling and rambling, and I doubt anyone will read everything I just let off of my chest, but I will say that writing this was a hugeeee relief. Venting definitely helps guys, that's for sure! Anyways, thank you so much.

But it was basically like idk how to explain it but where the person like Didnt know about sex/pleasure down there and stuff and the other person like showed them but I never thought of it in a way with a child because that\u2019s just abuse and children can\u2019t consent to that stuff anyway. It was always with an adult, like sort of like that Wonder Woman (it might\u2019ve been someone else) movie where her kind didn\u2019t need sex to reproduce so as an adult she didn\u2019t understand that I think, or like an adult who just was never interested in that stuff until then idk. And the \u201cinnocent\u201d person ALWAYS consented and wanted to do it, it was just where like they were new to sexual things.

There is a big difference that sort of helps calm me down remembering.

I don't need to have one person to turn to for all my issues and gripes and complaints. I don't need to have someone to tell me sweet nothings and to watch my shows with and share every leisurely activity with. I don't need to \"force\" this sort of connection in my life and I've cut out people that have been draining me. \n\nAnd ironically...

However, I couldn\u2019t sleep until 4 or 5 in the morning. It felt as if I had worse anxiety immediately after taking the pill. I had dry mouth, cold sweats, and felt confused.

It was at that point I told myself I\u2019m not taking another one of these pills because I don\u2019t want to do that again. I\u2019d rather do therapy, which is what I\u2019m going to look into tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s probably also worth noting\u2026 before taking the first pill, I read a bunch of horror stories about taking Zoloft, so I\u2019m pretty sure I had anxiety taking an anxiety med, which, I guess in a way, led me to feeling even more anxious? Or is it possible the pill itself caused me to feel that way? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I woke up yesterday around noon, I felt fine and felt that way up until around bedtime. I started feeling anxious again, got my mind off of it by watching TikTok, and then fell asleep. When I woke up an hour or two later, my anxiety/fear felt horrible. My arms felt stiff (not sleep paralysis stiff, but I guess heavy, is a better word?), I felt confused again, and I had cold sweats. I kept checking my pulse oximeter to make sure I was alright and not having a heart attack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then today (Sunday), I felt fine all the way up until nighttime a couple hours ago when I started feeling this odd feeling in my chest.

I say all of this to ask this question: Is it all in my head/me causing the increased anxiety, or did the one time I took the 50mg pill and stopped taking it after that one time cause it?

Basically I have anxiety and panic attacks well I haven\u2019t had a full blown panic attack in a while which I\u2019m proud of. I used to have 1 every. Single. Day. The worst experience of my entire life I would wish it on no one. I got help after a rocky ride the beginning for the panic attacks every single day for around 1-2~ years was my mother leaving me alone for almost a year. Mind you im a male so there\u2019s the you\u2019re a man act like one. You\u2019re never supposed to show emotions ever blah blah blah. And that\u2019s how I was for years. I didn\u2019t even tell my mother or brother I loved them until I was 19/20. I\u2019m in my 20s so back to the story that\u2019s how it started and I got help worked for a few months while I was starting to feel normal again my mom decides to take another job that requires her to live there. Again I ended up back to where I started. Without making this post any longer. I went back to it and then she promised me she wouldn\u2019t take another one of those jobs. Which she just did. And obviously I\u2019m hurt and mad maybe I said things I shouldn\u2019t have but when I was being calm and expressing my feelings she didnt care and even after being angry she didn\u2019t care. Which instead of making anything better is making me panic. But what made it full blown worse is she calls my brother which I thought okay maybe he could be understanding or show some sort of sympathy because he has 3 children turns out no, I get blamed. They think my anxiety my panic attacks is like a broken bone. Yea it\u2019ll heal in a certain amount of time. I think I\u2019ve been going to my psychiatrist for about a year and a half. In that time I haven\u2019t really had panic attacks all that often I usually try to take a pill right before it gets to that and go to sleep. So In my eyes I\u2019m in a better state than where I was before that. But In their eyes there\u2019s no improvement it\u2019s my fault it\u2019s the psychiatrist fault. Why aren\u2019t I working. Why aren\u2019t I being independent. Why am I secluded myself. Even after me expressing how angry and hurt and afraid they didn\u2019t care. If anything he was making jokes saying I should get electro shock therapy and brushing me off like nothing. I even got so angry and hurt that I told him I\u2019m gonna block him and he\u2019ll lose me he brushed it off laughed and said I don\u2019t care that\u2019s life. Which fucking hurt me.

I was lucky enough to keep working and really have no bad side effects of covid other than not having people over, (which for me and my introvert husband was a blessing).  \n\nThis year however is hitting like gang busters.  My father has the beginnings of dementia, the company I work for has been sold and and my career is in jeopardy and we won't know the results until after April.  The people who's car I hit in a car accident 2.5 years ago (3 car pile up not including my car) are suing me, and I am in the process of fixing medications and getting some professional help for my PTSD disorders and adhd issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this has created a good bit of chaos in my life and I am trying to contain my mental stability.\n\nI am a liberal.  I live in a red state and have been keeping my views mostly to myself because I don't feel it is necessary to argue with people who won't listen anyway.  My friend of over 20 years is a Conservative (sp?).  With the political climate we have now after what happened at the capitol building she is noticing for the first time people who have largely extreme right wing (violent IMHO ) views are being taken off social media.  She views this as a removal of their right to free speech. \n\nPersonally, I don't care.  These are private companies who don't want to be responsible for the actions of people on their service and they have a right to kick them off.   But that is not the point of my post.  Sorry.\n\nI can't handle her anger right now.  She won't accept that maybe I don't agree with her, and feels that I am just as bad when I tell her there is a reason I don't use my real name on anything online because I don't want to spend my life having to justify what I think.  I asked her nicely to please quit sending me articles about it.  Because I don't send her every article about every time I see a rapist get away with it, or heartbeat bills being passed, or anything else that would strip the freedoms from other people because I know she isn't interested.  \n\nTwo days ago, she sent me two more articles about people who are being kicked off or losing their jobs to being vocal in support of hate crimes.    I sent her two messages.  \"stop\"  and \"Please\".   Yesterday I asked her if she was mad at me because she had not responded to my texts and she responded with \"I am not in a good place to talk to you right now.\"\n\nThis pissed me off.  She has to my face called me a slut in so many words (because I am sexually active and have been  married before and am with my second husband.  She has had no serious relationship in her life and never been married, much less gotten someone she dated to last longer than three months)., she actually introduced me to her friend (my now husband) because he was on a 7 year drought and she thought I could end it for him. \n\nAnything you plan with her has to be set at her schedule.  And if you balk she always starts it with \"I can't help it if .....\" and some stupid reason why it has to go her way.   \n\nBut she isn't all bad.  She was there for my first divorce and fed me and help me through the tough times.

I don't know her exact problem, but her father told me that her mother had done dope and drank alcohol when she was pregnant with her.\n\nThis girl was throwing a tantrum after we left a pet store.

She leaned against me, and told me that I was ugly, had no friends, deserved to die, and would kill me if I let her. She began reaching for the wheel all slowly and dramatically like she was going to yank it into the oncoming traffic from my left side. The shadower yanked her back, but she kept lunging for the wheel, trying to make us crash into the other cars. I eventually pulled over on the side of the highway and called her mom. The girl then opened the car door and tried to run out into the field, saying that she was going to get us in trouble for losing her. We dragged her back into the car, and put on the child lock.

The stress from the day hit me all at once. I was exhausted and hungry so I had a snack and doodled a little on my iPad until I fell asleep. I was able to calm my thoughts and it was milder than my attacks that drove me to seek professional help (constant vomiting, hyperventilating) but I still got all the other symptoms out of no where and reminded me of how bad it feels and that I\u2019m still not fully \u201crecovered\u201d.

We do a lot of fun things together. Like right now we\u2019re starting an herb garden and I really enjoy talking about it and learning how to garden with her.  She\u2019s also really easy to talk to in general and it\u2019s really nice to know someone like her is there for me. \n\nI\u2019ve been having pretty bad panic attacks since the day she told me she loved me a couple months ago. I know the panic attacks are causing by a level of uncertainty I have with the relationship, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to give it up yet. I REALLY care about her and I think we have a lot of potential that I want to see through. \n\nEvery time I have a panic attack, it\u2019s filled with intrusive thoughts about how I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s the one and full of negative thoughts about our relationship and pressure to break up. Usually when I come down from it I feel more content and think about the great times we\u2019ve had together as opposed to the bad. Ultimately when I stop feeling panicked I don\u2019t want to break up. \n\nThe problem is, I feel like everything triggers me.

Last night we hung out and started to have a conversation about my anxiety. I started to get a little anxious and I felt her start to cling harder, wanting me to stay the night when I wanted to be in my own bed so I could get up at 6:30 for work the next morning. I ended up waking up to a panic attack this morning from the intrusive thoughts I had about her being lovey dovey upon leaving and being unable to reciprocate those feelings. \n\nWhat do I do?

I'm (m30) really worried about my SO's (f29) health and could really do with some advice. I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom. I'm not sure if any of this content may be triggering, so I apologise if it is.\n\nSome context - we have been together nearly 10 years; lived together for 6. Before that, we did long distance for 2 years. Long distance was hard, and during that time my SO was going through what she calls a \"hypochondriac stage\", in which she was always worrying about her health and scared she was going to get ill.\n\nAfter we moved in together, that worry subsided and things were ok. I suffer from mild anxiety too, so we both had our bouts every now and then, but great other than that. She would always think very low of herself though, especially her appearance and her weight. Whenever we went anywhere, 9/10 times she would have a break down about what she would be wearing, which often made us late or led to an argument or general stress.\n\nFast forward a few years. Just before Covid, she suffered the loss her step mother, who wasn't even 50. This was obviously devastating, but did lead to her and her dad becoming closer. Then Covid hit, and as such she has never fully had time to grieve for her step mum. On top of that, in June, her dad announced that he had met someone else. In November, he said they were moving in together. Two weeks ago, he announced they were getting married. The way that he announced all of these was either very nonchalantly (over Zoom/phone call) or in a very grandiose way, expecting congratulations I'm sure. Obviously, my SO (and her sister) are appalled, and her dad doesn't quite seem to understand why. On top of that, he is so wrapped up in his own life, that he isn't taking the time to ask how my SO/her sister are feeling about. It's very messed up, and I'm furious at him. So that's two reasons why she is feeling particularly stressed at the moment.\n\nThe third is work. We are both key workers, and as such have been going into work throughout the last year when others were WFH. On top of that, her work has been insanely busy and she is working on average 11 hour days, and the work still isn't done. The team she manages are not pulling their weight and management, from what I can gather, seem quite useless and keep promising solutions but never deliver. She doesn't want to quit, mainly because finding a job in this uncertain climate will be stressful too, and in the somewhat likely event that redundancies are made, it'll probably be a first in, first out situation. \n\nHer day of anxiousness usually goes as follows - \n\nWake up feeling stressed about work and about what to wear - will sometimes have a break down.\n\nAt work, overloaded with workload - will go to the bathroom to cry.\n\nIn the evening, will come home stressed after a bad day.\n\nAt night, will worry about sleeping and as a result will often have a big break down if she can't sleep/gets woken up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese break downs range from having trouble breathing to hurting herself - thankfully never seriously, but she has given herself scratches and bruises etc. Additionally, there are certain words that might trigger her, like if I mention anything about breathing, her chest goes tight. Or if I suggest we go to bed earlier, she becomes panicked about sleeping. \n\nI have suggested apps such as Headspace but she says they don't work, and she doesn't want to go on medication.\n\nI'm really worried about her, and feel awful that I don't really know how to help. I'm worried that one day she is going to badly hurt herself (she has never expressed anything about being suicidal, so I'm not worried about that - more just badly hurting), and also worried that, quite frankly, she could give herself a heart attack or something. It's also obviously having an effect on me, as every evening I'm on edge, not wanting to trigger a reaction in anyway, and feel absolutely rotten if I do. But, admittedly, the whole situation also makes me feel very angry. Not necessarily at her, but just like...why is this happening?  I hope that makes sense and doesn't make me sound like an asshole. I'm just at a loss with what to do. I love her more than anything and am just so worried about her, so any advice could be greatly appreciated, thank you!  \n\n\ntl;dr - SO is having panic attacks nearly every night and day, is extremely stressed, and I'm worried about her heatlh.", "title": "Looking for advice - worried about my SO who has anxiety"}, {"created_utc": 1617279030, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mhtx9p/im_at_breaking_point/", "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "selftext": "I can't take it anymore.

My (22M) ex (F22) and I were together for 4+ years. Throughout the relationship she\u2019s been dealing with severe anxiety problems but has sought help and managed it quite well. (I have been always amazed by her resilience) However, when COVID happened we ended up growing distant, which I will take a lot of the blame for. Additionally, she was extremely worried about getting her parents sick (we are both college students living at home) so she ended up isolating herself for about 7 months from all her friends including me. She later would open up to me that during this period she started having constant intrusive thoughts and was feeling really horrible a lot of the time. Although the warning signs were there, I have always been completely oblivious to social ques unless someone directly tells me. (This is something that I will work on now). Anyways, before she told me any of this I was really trying to fight for the relationship and she was really trying to fight for it too. Ultimately, I think I put too much pressure on her and she ended up breaking down under the urgency and pressure of things. This resulted in her opening up to me about what she was going through. \n\nAs someone who doesn\u2019t have a mental illness, hearing her talk about the anxieties she was facing was incredibly eye opening and terrifying. This moment finally made me understand, to some extent, the horrors she was dealing with. This was followed by saying she really doesn\u2019t feel like she can be in a relationship rn and also included that during this time she lost romantic feelings for me and said that I deserve someone who can better fulfill my emotional needs. Although it could be because I was crying, she admitted that she was unsure if this was us growing apart or her worsening mental health and felt that she could possibly see us getting back together. (Don\u2019t worry, Im reading this as she didn\u2019t wanna break my heart more) Throughout the conversation, i told her that I felt incredibly grateful she shared what she was going through and decided she was right and we should take a step back. We have since had a couple of really positive correspondences and have started the no contact phase where I basically suggested that if she wants to talk about anything she\u2019s going through, please reach out.\n\nAt this point, I know that amending the relationship is beyond possible at least for the conceivable future. I\u2019m currently dealing with the repercussions of that, as this is a person I love very dearly. That being said, she is my best friend and I need to respect her choice and take this as an opportunity to work on myself. Additionally, I realize that she wants to lighten her emotional load. In the present, this decision seems to be the best for everyone. However, what really concerns me is that I\u2019m the only person who really knows how bad things are for her (she told me this) and I\u2019m deeply worried that her support system without me is not robust enough. (Clearly it wasn\u2019t enough with me either \ud83d\ude43) Although she does have a therapist who she talks to about these issues, She has also admitted she\u2019s really good at hiding her emotions, specifically to her parents. All this absurdity has left me navigating a rather treacherous course. I\u2019m trying to repair my myself, reflect on what happened, but also worrying about if she is getting sufficient help. Not sure at all on what I should do. I was thinking about not contacting her for a month, hopefully figure out some of my shit, and come back and be able to support her platonically. I know that there is no way I can healthily support her platonically now, which fucking sucks cause there\u2019s nothing more that I want than for her to know that people care about her and she is an amazing person.\n\nI would appreciate any response, thanks.", "title": "Struggling on knowing the best course of action"}, {"created_utc": 1617277458, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mhti8x/why_is_my_memory_so_bad/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Is it my 2 concussions or anxiety??

It is a very safe community but this house is very old, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s super easy to break into... not to mention during this time of year a lot of our neighbors aren\u2019t around. It is a very safe town / community but I have such a terrible fear of having my house broken into, I always hear noises at night that aren\u2019t there and lie awake just listening for anything.

I want to warn potential readers that this is discussing something like \"sensorimotor obsessions breathing\" that I seem to have developed? I'm still not quite sure, it may be stress or anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout my situation: \n\nI live in Sydney, Australia, I'm 27 years old. Before the pandemic hit, very few times has this happened throughout my life as a kid, but never as an adult until covid-19 impacted us when respiratory was on everybody's news channel. Sometimes when I used to lay down in bed as a child my mind would slip into thinking about swallowing, coughing, or breathing. I've never encountered all of these happening at once, and thankfully I'm not suffering that fate currently either.\n\nIf I focused on those hard enough, my swallowing would become difficult, almost as if I'm afraid that I'll forget how to properly allow the saliva/food to go down without choking me. If I thought about coughing, my chest would actually tighten after several minutes, forcing me to have to start coughing to relieve myself. If I thought about my breathing, I guess I would manually override it and my breathing would feel completely in my hands. These normally would only linger for a few minutes until I would just snap out of those brief occurences. (As a kid)\n\nWhen the coronavirus happened, I was working for a 5-star hotel in Sydney, one of the hotels that acquired quaratine guests early on. To make this part short, I was let go before the Job Keeper came into effect, so I was one of the now many signing up for JobSeeker as an unemployed citizen. The period I had to wait before being confirmed of letting go took a total of 6 weeks, and during these 6 weeks (in April 2020 was when it was first mentioned to me that I might be let go), I was becoming a lot more insecure and on edge and I guess anxious about my future.\n\nThen one night before I was confirmed to be let go from my hotel job, it struck me. I was laying in bed just like I described prior as a child, and my mind fixated on my breathing all of a sudden. I felt like my life was ending, It kept me awake for hours, and hours, and as I let my partner sleep my heart seemed to be racing. I was so concerned of my safety that I was breathing in and out every second or very close to that, I even remember noticing that my mind no matter what I tried to think about, just kept reminding me \"Hey, you need to breathe!\". \n\nHonestly I couldn't even concentrate on my phone when I resorted to that on the first night, as I couldn't sleep and I was wide awake trying anything to ensure I was safely getting oxygen. I was so terrorized by this that If I read anything to do with \"breathing\" subtitles or on movies people would mention anything to do with breathing, or anywhere around me I would start to feel immediately pressured to breathe in and out manually and this can still haunt me time to time. \n\nIt's currently been almost a year and every night I cannot sleep without this occuring to me, albeit to a lesser extent it has waned over the last 6 months to \"Meh, I know it's going to happen\" as a way to make it not kick me into overdrive each night but there's still that discomfort when trying to sleep.\n\nEarly on last year after this invaded my life, I seemed to cope whenever I was sucking on Anticol so I'd literally be buying packs after packs in Woolworths or Coles. Imagine every hour of the first 4-6 months of sucking on those trying to find some comfort. I was addicted to them because it was somehow allowing me to stop thinking about my breathing during the day (although it didn't always work), cause when this first happened.. it was bad to the point I fell behind on all sleeping schedules I had when working. \n\nAdditionally, I couldn't concentrate or have the ability to just relax during the day so this was terrorizing me not just during night time but also every hour of the day. \n\nPresently It's really only impacting my night time, when I go to bed even if the breathing somehow didn't affect my day whatsoever, It would just immediately invade my mind as I got into my bed and I would have to rub this \"chest ointment\" to get me to feel a bit more relaxed as I applied to my chest.\n\nI have seen 2 GPs last year when this was really bad, and neither of them really had any guidance for me to try to alleviate my situation besides recommending using a bag to breathe into whenever I felt like it got worse, which didn't help since I was in a constant state of thinking about my breathing anyways so I quickly dropped trying this method.\n\nI've tried talking to myself about not caring because \"my breathing is autonomous and it doesn't require my brain to focus on it\", this unfortunately didn't help. I've tried to do things productively on my computer with a few marginal successes here and there when it comes to my daily routines early on last year, nowadays I can be more productive during the day, but it activates during night time. \n\nAnd because whatever I do at my daily routine doesn't seem to be helping my night breathing issue, I'm stuck not knowing how or what I can do.. so I'm begging anybody that might have had this to give me any suggestions or advice as I'm literally fed up with this shit ruining my life.", "title": "I need help!

She also hasnt added me on social media and doesn't share any pictures of us. I addressed this and she said her ex used to harass her on what she liked and commented on. I said I'll wait then, but asked why she doesnt share us and she said she likes it being our thing, our bubble, without people being involved or snooping.

It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are \"oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you.\" Or \"oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30\" \n\nFuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself.

In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like \"oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling.

I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months.

So the girl in charge comes and tells me to put on this white shirt to model... no problem, right? Well while I'm waiting to take photos I make small talk with the other models there. They're all pretty nice but in the midst of this I started sweating profusely. Whenever I talk to complete strangers, I start to sweat. Sweat starts dripping down my bra and I know I'm doomed. I looked down and see the shirt getting drenched with sweat and it's clearly visible. I cover it with the shirt I was wearing before I put on the shirt the girl wanted me to wear. But as soon as I do that, the girl says it's time for me to shoot and I'm first.\n\nEveryone was looking at me, no joke. I didn't know how to stall for time and got up and did a light sprint to the cameras and hoped no one saw. I tried not to let it bother me when the photographer was taking pictures but you could see it I'm assuming.

Sorry if there are grammatical errors...\n\nAbout 7 years ago I thought I had found the love of my life, nothing seemed wrong in our relationship at all and everything was great.\n\n Was with this girl for about a year or so but then something happened between us and I don't really know what, she tried to break things off slowly but it only made things worse between us. Valentines day rolled around and I wanted to take her out to hopefully fix things... now keep in mind I felt like we were working on things so I tried to go big. That day was the start of a cycle of horrible things that has happened to me till the present time. She broke up with me on that Valentines day, I had spent over 300$ on her, and she said \"I guess I really never loved you as much as I thought I did.\" \n\nI was completely destroyed, I had never been through a mental break down like I had then... I blacked out, I didn't work for 6 months and I lost over 40 pounds (I was already a skinny guy). After all that she came back to be about a year later crying and begging me to help her with a bill... I fell into the trap thinking this would help us get back together and then it all started over again.\n\nAfter a while things got a little better, I moved on, and got a girlfriend that I am currently with... it's been 5 years for us.\n\n Over those 5 years though I had to watch as both my grandparents wither away, watching my mother trying her hardest to take care of them all by herself as her siblings sat by and watched and did nothing. My mom gave up her career to be the good daughter they raised her to be, her siblings didn't help her financially or anything... luckily my dad was able to get a better job so they could just scrape by. I did my best to help them financially when I could but the bad luck never stopped, it just kept comming. \n\nMy grandfather was probably the person I looked up to the most in the entire world, I never have respected someone as much as I did him. He was the most kindhearted, hardworking, non judgmental person I've ever met... he always tried to help everyone. Seeing him pass away in the way he did was cruel punishment for us both. If you don't know what neuropathy is you need to look at the late stages of it, that is what I had to see... the strongest man I knew turn into a withered shell, he couldn't even stand or raise his arms, he would try to speak but his lungs were so damaged from the neuropathy that just saying a few words took his breath so he opted not to speak instead. \n\nThis was every day for 5 years, seeing my grandparents like this, trying to be there for my mom while she cried in my arms... while knowing there is nothing you can do, I was helpless and all could do is just be there for then while he slowly passed away. Last year he died February 2020, and I'm still feeling th pain of the loss.\n\nRight after he passed away my grandmother started getting dementia and everything kept spiraling out of control. That's when I found out the cousin I grew up with died in a fatal car crash, he was on his way to see his daughter. We had been talking about hanging out right before he passed away, we had not seen each other in so long we really needed to catch up... but that is never going to happen now.\n\nRight after my cousin passed my grandmother got covid, she was hospitalized and she didn't pull through. It's like things never stop getting worse for me, I just want it all to stop, I just want peace, I just want to feel normal again.\n\nRight after my grandmother passed my dad's car caught on fire and my mom also got covid when my grandmother did. Mom still has not fully recovered from it and it has made her seem so feeble, she said she is trying so hard to get back on her feet but last week she went back to the doctor for a check up and the doctor thinks she may have cancer... this up coming Tuesday is her appointment to see her results, she begged me to go with her because she is so scared of what the results will be.\n\nI don't know what to do, I feel like I'm at my whits end and I don't know how much more I will be able to hold out.

My dr has assured me I\u2019m fine but obviously it is still pretty scary.\nThe issue is I have not been working for 3 months and I am close to running out of savings, so I need to get back to work. Not just for money but also I think for my sanity a little bit. \nHowever, I am absolutely petrified. Going to a new place, with all new people whilst having these strange \u2018symptoms\u2019 that I am struggling with seems so overwhelming.\nHas anyone been through this situation?

In hindsight, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever really been ok, but I\u2019ve been particularly not ok lately.\n\nI changed jobs at the start of the year \u2013 a sideways move in the same company. The work-load at the old work area had become very light and I was worried my skills would become rusty, so I thought that something new might do me good.\n\nBad mistake. I was suddenly supposed to be an expert in every sphere of my field. I had been recruited on the promise that there would be a group of people I could lean back on for expertise. No sign of them. The only other person with the same specialty as me was the guy I was supposed to be supervising and he was based interstate, so comms were an issue. Then he got fired for underperformance.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t even tell me that he was being fired; I found out from his farewell email. He was supposed to be replaced immediately, but our field is niche, so recruitment is tough and deadlines were tight. I inherited his entire workload. And my second-level manager seems to have some issue with me; I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever been satisfied with anything I said to her.\n\nFor the past few months, I\u2019m in tears at the drop of a hat and sometimes my anxiety is so bad that it takes me hours to write an email. I\u2019ve always been the anxiety-prone type and had a predilection for depression, but it has never gone on for this long. I rang up the work-funded mental health service. The councillor is nice. What she says makes sense, even helps I think. Some days anyway.\n\nMy project manager and deputy project manager have asked me if I\u2019m considering leaving. At the time, I told them no. Because I hadn\u2019t seen anything I was interested in and because the thought of writing a job application and doing interviews seemed like too much. I figured we\u2019d get past the deadlines and it\u2019ll be ok. Except it\u2019s not. I do need a different job.\n\nA stroke of luck \u2013 a decent job came up with a new project in my old work-area. It was a good day, so I decided that I\u2019d go for it. But then came the job application. My chest was tightening before I even opened the selection criteria and I was in tears ten minutes later. The tears won\u2019t stop either and worse yet, for the first time in a decade, I actually want to do something to myself. Take a pair of scissors to my skin, burn myself with an iron, just pour a litre of vodka down my throat. I took a shower in an effort to clear my head. Instead, I wanted to bash my forehead into the shower walls until I bled.\n\nI didn\u2019t. I won\u2019t.\n\nBut this is all from me attempting to write a job application (which is still not finished btw). What if I get an invitation for a job interview? What happens if I get the job? What if I don\u2019t get the job? What if I can't get *any* other job and will be stuck where I am for years, until some restructure shuffles me off to god-knows-where? I can\u2019t just quit. I bought a property this year; there\u2019s a mortgage to pay.\n\nAnd the sucker-punch is? This job was only meant to be a means to an end. A means of funding my real passion \u2013 writing fiction. I\u2019ve been sitting on a finished novel since June. It needs a query letter and it\u2019ll be ready to go to a literary agent. But attempting to get published means potentially endless rounds of rejection. How do I deal with that if I can\u2019t handle filling out an application form? And if my work does get picked up (pretty unlikely in the first place), how do I deal with editors\u2019 critique, with self-promotion, with bad reviews? I don\u2019t think I could do it.\n\nAh, shit. I\u2019m crying again", "title": "Trapped by my own brain (tw: thoughts of self harm)"}]
