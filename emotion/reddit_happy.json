When I met him, I thought he was some random 17 year old kid who was our new dishwasher. Turned out to be a very young looking 28 year old man who would be joining our prep team. I've always had a thing for gingers. We worked together everyday for a full year, and I really liked how he operated. He was so clean, efficient and amazing at multi tasking. This guy could crush a whole prep list in an hour or so, while the kitchen area was spotless, no dishes and a clean apron. \n\nThere was this one time we went off in a rage of passion about how specific \"crunchies\" should he stored alphabetically, use first on top, refills underneath, with all the tape labels facing the exact same way (on messier chef wasn't putting them away properly) And that was the exact moment I knew I had to have him. I caught myself always staring at him as he went back to his station. Over the weeks and months we ended up closing together and we would walk from downtown towards his parents house, and my apartment, taking me to my door everytime. I know he did it just to make sure I got home safe, but I knew he loved it too. \n\nI started inviting him in to play Mario games on my wicked gaming setup. We spent the whole summer crushing services and playing video games until 3am most days. Everytime he would leave, I would walk him down and he would say \"I can't believe how late we always end up hanging out\" and after a full year of making sure he was what I wanted, I asked him out.\n\nHe hadn't been with anyone for 4 years before me, and was very anxious and vanilla, but having to start from scratch didn't bother me. On our first date while playing jenga at a bar, some kids ran into the restaurant and threw lit firecrackers at the tables in the back. We thought it was gunshots and the restaurant cleared out. It was so scary and intense.. long story short we got free takeout and went home to play video games. I just remember feeling okay if that was the end and we were going to die. I finally got to go out with him.\n\nAnother thing I really love about him is how passionate his is about proper recycling, composting and purchasing things in bulk with jars. I watched him today in the recycling bin aisle picking new bins. He was in such deep thought about picking the right ones and kept bouncing ideas off me. I just watched him in awe with  big ol silly grin. It made me giggle and feel warm inside.\n\nAlmost 2 year later we now live together in our very labeled apartment. Our favourite activities are putting away groceries and cleaning out the fridge together, reorganizing things in our home, and being the ultimate completion-ists with our video games. He finished Mario odessy with 100% and it was super cute how excited he got when he beat the entire game and all it's moons.\n\nHe fills my beside water, makes my bed when I forget, wipes down the calendar and starts the next month 10am on the 1st of the month. He fluffs the pillows on the couch, wipes down the electronics, and cares so much about how the bathroom looks and smells. He gives so much of a fuck about himself, manscapes all his areas to be well groomed, gets haircuts on the dot every 6 weeks (prebooks the next one when he's there) and has an amazing bedtime skin routine. \n\nWe never argue, we communicate our wants, desires and thoughts. He problem solves quickly, goes right to Wendy's for exactly what I would order when I'm pissy on my period. And watching him make  to do list and cross the entire thing off in a few days makes me wetter than the ocean. \n\nI never ask people to do things for me because 1. I want it done a very specific way and 2. I feel like an asshole trying to explain how and why I want it done that way. Which I can never explain because I want in done that way because I view it as the correct way in my mind. And one day I realized, I truthfully and genuinely trust this person. If I give them a task or ask a favour he will 1. Do it my way or 2. When I tell him I need it done  certain way he doesn't argue and goes \"I understand that\" because he thinks the same way, which makes me feel whole inside.\n\nMy past relationships made me feel with my obsessive compulsive disorder I was unlovable. That the way I liked things was unachievable and too high of a standard. People would often compare me to Monica from friends. I like labels on the food in the fridge, first in first out, super clean windows, I always cared about my entire house being \"setup as if surprise guests would be coming over.\" I felt like an asshole trying to get people to clean up better, and to give more of a fuck. I had come to terms with the fact I could date for fun, but not for a long term serious relationship. I was told no one would clean up at 3am after a board game night because they were too tired to do the dishes, put the pieces in the correct boxes, and reset the living room.\n\nUntil I met you.\n\nYou made me feel like I wasn't alone.\n\nI love you.\n\nAlways yours,\n\nGM", "title": "I met my OCD match, and have never been happier: a feel good story."}, {"created_utc": 1611214202, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l1tllk/i_got_my_bff_and_i_cheap_gowns_and_we_had_a/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I got my bff and I cheap gowns and we had a fantastic night in"}, {"created_utc": 1611209296, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l1shrr/bought_two_gowns_online_and_had_an_amazing_night/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Bought two gowns online and had an amazing night with my bff"}, {"created_utc": 1611209214, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l1sh33/my_bff_and_i_had_a_gown_night_in/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "My bff and I had a gown night in!"}, {"created_utc": 1611208397, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l1s9qd/girls_night_in/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Girls night in!"}, {"created_utc": 1611205808, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l1rmr1/my_fiance_signed_me_up_for_3_free_months_of/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "My fiance signed me up for 3 Free months of satellite radio because I'm too cheap.

I've also been massaging my cuticles and the nails themselves with oil between painting. (Just an hour or two without paint, more than that = breakage.) \n\n\n\nThe result is that my nails, while all are very slightly different lengths, haven't broken yet! I feel so much more feminine. I used to get fake nails occasionally, but the dremel actually hurt on my sad nails, as did the acrylic itself while it was wet; it really burned.

I was desperate for a solution when a good friend recommended me these two products (am not affiliated to them in any way, just wanted to put it out there to help a fellow reddit friend) -- The first solution is a massage mat which derives its origins from an ancient Indian healing method which dates back to 5,000 years ago ([https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat](https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat)). Simply by laying on this mat for 20 mins a day, you'll be in a deep state of relaxation, and this really helps to relieve any aches or pain from your neck, shoulder -- all the way to your upper and lower back.\n\nThe second item that really helped me with my condition -- in particular my degenerative disks in the cervical region -- is this neck traction device ([https://the-orthorelief.com/](https://the-orthorelief.com/)) which helps to relief pain by gently stretching your neck and spine.\n\nHopefully this changes someone's life the way it did for mine :') Cheers, and feel free to reach out to me if you need any other tips!", "title": "I'm happy that I finally found the ONE thing that helped with my back and neck pain!"}, {"created_utc": 1611055156, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l0hxh1/dear_happy_people_whats_it_like_what_are_your/", "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Dear happy people: what\u2019s it like?

I hope you are all happy and healthy - or working towards it :) \n\nI just got a Cricut and wanted to try making a shirt so this is my first attempt.

So I was telling him the other day how grateful I am that he's planting the seeds that I am good enough and that I deserve to be happy. But - I realized that wasn't what I meant. \n\nFor years professors have told me I'm smart, or that I'm doing a good job. Strangers and friends compliment my appearance or my personality. But those seeds never take root. Any seeds that have been planted haven't been able to grow because my garden is just too dry and uncared for. So I think it's more accurate to say my counselor is watering my garden! :-p He is/ he's helping me make my garden/mind a place where the old and new seeds can take root and grow! :) and I liked that analogy for all of counseling really. Counselors help us make our mind into a healthier place so we can grow confidence, happiness, and everything else we need! :) \n\nSo I made a shirt to remind me to keep working on watering my garden and making my mind a place that fosters all the good I want in my life :) \n\nHere it is :) I know it's not much but it's the first thing I've drawn, designed, or made into a shirt so it's still pretty cool lol\n\n*Processing img wdyo1zgp6zr61...*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ay7h50q0bzr61.jpg?width=2228&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b87c58545ff91deddc1f802c5ab528c67105866\n\n(Explanation - it's a garden being watered with a few little plants starting to grow.

One day I ran into an acquaintance\u2014we\u2019ll call her Mari\u2014who I met through a club. She asked me if I was going to head to lunch, I said yes, and we ate together. She introduced me to all of her friends, and we had a blast.\n\nI started hanging out with Mari a lot more after that day. I had just fallen out with my old friend group so Mari took me in as her \u201clittle sister.\u201d She was really sweet, and I got a lot closer with her, her roommate Cali, and another friend Nation. We spent a lot of time together this semester, eating almost every meal together and hanging out almost every night. Cali and Nation have also adopted me as a \u201clittle sister.\u201d\n\nThings at college have been really tense. I don\u2019t want to accidentally turn this into a \u201csilver lining\u201d post so I won\u2019t go into details. But for the whole semester I\u2019ve been having really bad nightmares and hallucinations. I also can never sleep the whole night because my dorm room is close to the front door and people scream like chimpanzees walking in. So Mari and Cali offered to clean up the third bed and let me sleep in their room. I\u2019ve been there for many days since they first offered and it\u2019s helped a lot.\n\nTonight I had a panic attack. I didn\u2019t want to call my parents or my therapist for whatever reason (ig because I\u2019m tired of depending on them so much?) so I called Mari. She came right over to my room and spent probably an hour with me just hugging me and comforting me as I cried in her arms. She spent another half hour listening to me complain about life and explain what in the world is running through my head. I cried about how I was so scared about losing her and stressing her out and she was so reassuring. Whenever I was highly stressed, my previous friends would say they would always be there for me (spoiler alert: they weren\u2019t). Mari said that as well, but she also added that I deserved friends who could care for me like this at the bare minimum. She said some other comforting things as well which distracted me from the fear of broken promises. And on top of that, she invited me over to her room again so I could focus better on homework and sleep better.\n\nI love these girls so much ;w; I hope I don\u2019t lose them.", "title": "I have awesome college \u201csisters\u201d and I\u2019m so lucky to have them in my life, especially now"}, {"created_utc": 1617767288, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mltjkc/i_have_awesome_college_sisters/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I have awesome college \u201csisters\u201d"}, {"created_utc": 1617767055, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mlth9z/im_having_a_life_changing_surgery_on_the_8th_as_a/", "num_comments": 44, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I'm having a life changing surgery on the 8th!

I figured here would be as good a place as any. I met my very good friend as early as kindergarten, and he helped me and everyone else in our friend group so much. All throughout grade school, and even highschool he was the best friend anyone could ask for, but there was always one thing he did that constantly puts a smile on my face. Me and the rest of our friends weren't always that motivated to due schoolwork, and you'd often hear me say something along the lines of \"I don't feel like studying for this test\" or even as far as \"I'm fine with failing this project completely.\" Despite that, my best friend was there everytime. The thing that was amazing about him, was how he would encourage me to do work in school. Anytime there was a project, he'd tell me 'if you get a passing grade, I'll give you $20 and I'll come over and play COD with you.' He told me much later he would mow lawns and shovel driveways to save up enough money to have the money to do that, because he had started it all the way back in grade 5. He would spend so much of his time, sometimes even hours a day in order to save up enough money to encourage me to do great in school, and create a worth ethic that still holds true in me to this day. I have no idea how my school life would have been without him, or even my life in general, but it makes me so happy that he was always there for me. Everyone in life deserves a friend like him, and I believe if everyone had support like that the world would be such a great place.", "title": "Thank you to my best friend, for always encouraging me to do my best"}, {"created_utc": 1590972190, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/guana2/the_grin_of_a_man_who_finally_got_two_days_off_to/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 19, "selftext": "", "title": "The grin of a man who finally got two days off to be in the woods with no cell phone.

Also, I want to write my own cartoon when I grow up, so I partially write because I want to learn how to put stories together on my own time.\n\nBasically, while writing is a fun and rewarding hobby that I enjoy doing, it's not always a relaxing hobby and there's an underlying purpose of \"I do it because it's useful\".\n\nSchool also gets busy and stressful from time to time (not counting coronavirus), and I have a feeling that when I enter charter school, it'll become even more hectic. (The fact that I got in is a double happy post in and of itself.)\n\nI used to love video games, but then I made a conscious decision not to play them when they started taking up precious writing/homework time -this was before I scrapped a stressful story and established a schedule. Now that I finally have time to play video games due to no school, it just feels like I'm doing it 'cause my work timeslot is gone and I need to fill it with something.\n\nBasically, I need hobbies that are relaxing and not time-consuming.\n\nWell, a few months ago, I was digging around in the never-used drawer of my bedside table (due to cleaning) and found an old recorder I hadn't touched since third grade. Yes, *that* recorder that parents and children alike remember with a certain sense of scorn. Out of curiosity, I decided to play that old instrument.\n\nApparently I was good enough to not blow everyone's ears out on first try -and in fact, I was surprisingly skilled at it even though I hadn't done it in years. I left it on my bedside table and played it every once in a while. My desire to do music was sort of rekindled by Steven Universe, so I started replicating songs on the recorder with some difficulty.\n\nWell, I was later told to move my recorder off the bedside table because of some idiotic rule that there were no more than two items on a surface so the house would sell (definitely not happening now, lol), and chose to take it downstairs to the side table next to the couch. (Said couch was replaced by two chairs.)\n\nThis combined with my habit of being downstairs and my increased desire to sing (long story) revived the spark of my appreciation for music. I started playing the recorder more and more, to the point of doing it out of boredom when I didn't feel like writing.\n\nAnd now, here I am, loving my recorder so much that when I'm waiting for day to arrive in a specific video game, I play along to the nighttime soundtrack. My fingers just flow on the recorder so quickly and easily. It's relaxing.\n\nYesterday, I got acceptance letters for charter school under the writing department, and oddly enough, I also received a paper of other class options that were all music-related. I am mildly interested in the woodwind option and would pick it up if it were a one-semester thing, except it's a major class from the music department and I worry that if I pick it without needing to, it'll be more intense than I have time for and my already-hectic homework load from writing will become even more hectic. (If I am required to pick a music class, I'd pick the woodwinds in a heartbeat.) I could get around this by asking for private lessons outside of school. I hated my old piano lessons because it involved formalities like recitals and exams, and I was on someone else's rather strict schedule and rules instead of mine. Plus, for me, treating as a second school and not a hobby defeats the purpose of me wanting to relax by playing music myself. All I have in mind is just something I'm casually interested in, no formalities or real schooling involved. I could get around this by, once again, asking for an instructor with looser guidelines and no real formalities.\n\nBasically, I'm considering some kind of non-complicated woodwind instrument that's slightly more complicated than the recorder that I can treat as a relaxing hobby.", "title": "Found a potential hobby that, under the right circumstances, isn't too time consuming and not related to productivity!"}, {"created_utc": 1584479781, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fkd9tr/there_are_good_people_out_there_during_this_hard/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 3, "selftext": "With everything going on in the world at the current moment, it's scary.

Then, when I got my first job in 2015, I decided that building my own PC was gonna be the best way to accomplish this. I had to put off my dream for about a year because I was using money not only to get a car, but also to buy Christmas gifts for my whole family.\n\nFast-forward to 2016, and now that I had the money, I read various articles on Wikihow and Lifehacker about how to go about doing it. Once I had the know-how and the parts, I spent much of Sunday, July 24, 2016 building the thing, and once it was all put together, I capped off that day by watching the John Carpenter movie *Dark Star*. Unfortunately, when I went to turn it on the next day, it wouldn't fire up. I got depressed at the possibility of having to buy new parts for it, so I asked my second-youngest brother - who probably frequents this wonderful website somewhere - to help me iron out the bugs. \n\nOwing to a family vacation and unfavorable scheduling issues on my brother's part, he wasn't able to come over (we lived in different houses at the time) to check it out until Friday, August 12, 2016.

On a lesser note, a RAM chip also hadn't been seated properly. \n\nNevertheless, once those were out of the way, installing the operating system and the graphics card drivers was a snap, and my 1st PC build has made gaming awesome ever since.

We complement each other well, I\u2019ve never had a feeling someone was \u201cthe one\u201d up until now. He shows me what love is supposed to feel like and how someone is supposed to treat their spouse. \n\nEach day we\u2019d hang out (which was once or twice a week) id fall even more in love with him. The way he laughs, his smile, those beautiful bright blue eyes that make me feel like I\u2019m home. This was my first time actually loving someone and I finally realized love is supposed to make you feel good. \n\nWe made our relationship official on 2/24/2020 and the spark between us feels more ignited than it ever had before. We had this incredible chemistry on our first date and we kept getting closer and closer. \n\nFast forward to last Wednesday I told him I had something to tell him. I had been wanting to tell him I love him and had been working up the courage for weeks. I finally couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and had to tell him. I wanted to wait until he said it first so that I knew he was ready, but I figured if he wasn\u2019t I\u2019d tell him he could wait until he was ready. \n\nIt took me 30 minutes to get it out, I was so nervous. I don\u2019t tell people I love them unless I truly do, it\u2019s something that is really important to me and shouldn\u2019t be thrown out to just anyone.

He was giving me the slightest push to finally come out with it and just started singing songs that had I love you in it but wanted me to fill in the blank. \n\nI finally say it and he says it back, my heart absolutely bursted. A few minutes later I asked him to say it again and he says it. It was the happiest I\u2019ve ever been my heart was fluttering, he walks me to my car and asks me to say it again. I did and we just stood there holding and kissing each other for a good five minutes. \n\nThis morning I turn over to him in bed and tell him I love him. He says I love you and gives me a big kiss good morning, we were still a bit sleepy but all the love in the world was still there. I\u2019m so certain he\u2019s the one I\u2019ll marry, I never wanted kids but it\u2019s different with him.

Had to get it off my chest.\n\nHey guys! A few years ago I posted here. I was having a terrible time due to my ex boyfriend cheating on me and telling me he was in love with this other girl. We lived together at the time and I had just gotten a job after being jobless for awhile. It was one of the most difficult things I've ever had to go through. It turned my whole world upside down and inside out. I remember losing about 30-60lbs after because I was barely eating. I didn't talk to anyone for awhile, didn't make friends at my new job and had no one to talk to. I was even homeless for awhile at some point. I say this to emphasize just how fucked up everything was. And that lasted for at least year of it being that bad. \n\nI started to get better slowly and get over it. I started to open up and let very few people in. I even started to date at some point. There were quite a few other bad things that happened in the time in between then and now but I got through them. Each made me a stronger person and I'm more independent now than I have ever been which is a really big change for me. I realized the relationship I had been in was incredibly toxic and that I should have left the first time he cheated on me. But to be fair I would not have all the life experience I have now so whatever. I am still working through a few things that made a deep mark on my psyche from that relationship but it's going really well especially because of the man that I have now.\n\nWe are about to celebrate our first anniversary together. I could not have imagined that in a few short years that I would find someone as wonderful as he is. We've actually known each other since middle school and it's an incredibly cute story. It all started with a note that I don't even remember to be honest. I wrote him a note when we were both in middle school telling him I liked him a lot and asking him if he would be my boyfriend. Because of his dad's rules which was in part because of some religious reasons, he was forced to give the note back to me and tell me no. He was not happy about this at the time and looking back his whole family including his mom would've told him to keep the note. Now on the other hand I remember a time when he ended up giving me a piggy back ride around the neighborhood[around the same time of the note I think]. And of course he doesn't remember that so we're even. \n\nAnyway, we've reconnected after all these years and it all started with that note. My main point of this was to say how truly happy I am now. It's easy of course now to compare with the relationship I had before. But he just told me that my anniversary gift is currently being made and should be here on time. Did you catch that? Made. He's having something personally made for me. He created his own design apparently. He hasn't told me any more than that but that's okay. This isn't even the first time he's had something made for me. He had a blanket made for me for our 6 months. The blanket was a love letter. Like an actual blanket that looks like notebook paper that he wrote a love letter on. The thought that went into this was insane and I cried. And I'm sure I will cry when I receive whatever he's having made now. I know gifts shouldn't be all that important but what's important to be is the thought and the sentiment behind it. My past relationship...it could have never lived up to that. It never did. This is only a snippet of what being with him is like. He's understanding, he makes room for me to talk instead of silencing me. I've been able to be more open with him than I have with any other person ever, even best friends. He's been there for me through a surgery, he'll be there for me through my next couple coming up. He's the man I want to marry and have kids with. And it seems like pretty soon that will be a reality. \n\nThis is my update. Don't settle. If you feel even slightly off wherever you are, with whoever you're with, doing whatever you're doing. It'll be scary, maybe even extremely scary. But make the change that's best for you.

So next was a date. I have never been so stressed and excited at the same time in my life. Thankfully I didn't ruined it, so it went even further and we had sex. I still think that I somewhat ruined it a little - in my defense I never thought that a man could give me such intense orgasm. There was one red flag morning after, when he asked me to not spread the word about us for a few weeks (especially in our work and work-related grup of friends - he is my coworker and supervisor). I agreed, but deep down I was scared that this relationship will quickly end. But it didn't. Week later he told me that he arranged my transfer to different team, so he will no longer be my boss, asked me to spend some holiday's time with his family and to announce our relationship to our friends (if we won't spill that earlier) during New Year's celebration. At the end it went great. First part of Christmas holiday's we spent with my family and everybody loved him. My mother told my in private that she never saw me so happy. Next two days we spent with his family and they all are so caring and loving (with only his sister joking about our age gap). Our announcement during New Year's party ended with few 'finally' from our friends.\n\nSometimes I could not believe we are actually together. That one day this dream will end and we will be just friends with me stuck in his friendzone. Other than that I am also happy that we are still friends, of course right now we spend more time together, we are doing new things as a couple, sex we have is the best sensation I've had in my whole life (I am a little bit ashamed that if that would be up to me we wouldn't leave 'bed'), but at the same time he is the same person as before.

She stopped tonight after 13 hours of driving, we talked for a bit then she went to bed to get up early tomorrow for another full day of driving....  but half an hour after she had gone to bed, she turned her phone back on and texted me about how nervous she is about this big move and asked me to take a picture of myself for her.\n\nI of course sent her one immediately and talked to her a bit more to help calm her nerves til she fell asleep.\n\nNow, I love this woman.  And one of the things I love most about her is how independent she is.  She'll be the first one to tell you, she never wants to be dependent on anyone.  She's brilliant and hard working and has succeeded at some really difficult stuff...  I really am so proud of her and so proud to be able to call her my partner.\n\nAnd yeah... we SAY we love eachother a lot, we SAY we're partners, we SAY we're always there for one another, etc....  but tonight was just a moment where, it wasn't just saying it.  She was nervous, and wanted to see my face so she could rest easy.  I got to be the man who supported her when she needed it.\n\nI dont know.  It wasn't a huge deal.  In context, its just a small moment among the years we've known one another...  She's sound asleep now, and I myself am only half awake haha.  But it just feels nice to know that someone like her could so genuinely want me in her life.  And keep me so close to her heart.\n\nI guess I'm just really happy to be there for her.  I just can't stop smiling about it as im falling asleep right now.", "title": "My girlfriend is feeling nervous and texted me in the middle of the night asking for a picture of me to help her feel better"}, {"created_utc": 1610773711, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kycjxx/day_3_happiness_7_days_yoga_journey_7_days_yoga/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Day 3 - Happiness | 7 Days Yoga Journey | 7 Days Yoga Series for Beginne..."}, {"created_utc": 1610772081, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kyc4n1/sometimes_internet_strangers_can_be_the_nicest/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "It makes me so happy to see Reddit users willing to go out of their way to help those in need during this pandemic.

We made a vacation of it and while in Switzerland we ate at this gorgeous restaurant overlooking a stunning view. While checking out the view we bumped into this lady who was traveling by herself. She was from Asia and taking a vacation around Europe on her own and we just started chatting with her and got to know her. After chatting for a while, we were having such a good time that we decided to invite her to have dinner with us. We ate, drank and got to know each other for hours. \n\nWe had such an incredible time, exchanged phone numbers and promised to keep in touch. As we were leaving, she made my then girlfriend and I promise that she would get an invitation to our wedding when we got engaged. We jokingly laughed but promised her that she would get an invitation.\n\nThe years go by, we forgot about it, my fiance and I got engaged and our wedding is now coming up in August. While we were going through our guest list, we remembered this lady and decided we were going to keep up our promise and invite her. I texted her via WhatsApp (we hadn't spoken in years and  didn't even think we would be able to get through to her) and we let her know that although we knew she wouldn't come we wanted to keep our promise and invite her.\n\nSurprisingly, she responded! We started chatting again as if we had just met and she said that she had been meaning to take a trip to the US for a while, maybe this would be her catalyst! My fiance and I were amazed, but still had doubts that she would actually follow through.\n\nFast forward another few months and Coronavirus happened. Our state is doing pretty well on keeping Coronavirus down and so with some extra precautions and a slightly smaller guest list, we're deciding to proceed with our wedding. As such, I decided I would reach out to this lady again and just check to see how she was doing. \n\nShe just got back to me. **SHE HAD BOOKED A FLIGHT AND PLANNED ON SURPRISING US!!!** This random lady that we had met on a mountain in Switzerland was sweet and thoughtful enough to fly across the world and surprise us at our wedding. I am overcome with happiness and joy at how sweet that is, and as disappointing as it is that the pandemic may not allow her to come and visit, we'll remember her and her incredible gesture forever.\n\nThe photos are of her thoughtful response and of that dinner in Switzerland. I don't know if she would appreciate her photo on the internet so her face has been blacked out for privacy.\n\n**TLDR**: My family met a lady from Asia in Switzerland while on vacation. Got to know her, invited her to have dinner with us and became fast friends. She made us promise that my then girlfriend and I would invite her to our wedding. Years pass, get engaged, invite her to our wedding without any expectations and come to find out, she had planned on surprising us by flying from Asia to attend.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0tznjiijw951.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8551168fb0405a8d8ea8a12a98074861c23f4f6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgaqjniijw951.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed84e15e36da424313e4cfacaabc79184ca3d9a6", "title": "A happy story of an incredible stranger who became the sweetest friend"}, {"created_utc": 1594330364, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hobu7n/finally_plucked_up_enough_courage_to_take_my/", "num_comments": 34, "score": 5, "selftext": "", "title": "Finally plucked up enough courage to take my first selfie ever just 'cause"}, {"created_utc": 1594322627, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ho9gh8/hi_everyone_if_youre_tired_of_depressing_news/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Hi everyone if youre tired of depressing news then pleases follow our page https://www.facebook.com/justhappyfeelgood where we only share happy, positive, feel good news"}, {"created_utc": 1594312800, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ho6djn/thank_you/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "title": "Thank you"}, {"created_utc": 1594312671, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ho6c2j/feelings_of_joy/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "title": "Feelings of joy"}, {"created_utc": 1594311423, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ho5y1z/got_to_see_my_little_ghostface_girl_this_morning/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 3, "selftext": "", "title": "Got to see my little ghost-face girl this morning.

I've been living a bachelor lives here in California almost 3 years now and to say that I enjoy it is an understatement, i own a 4 bedroom house with a large backyard for gardening and for my dog (Italian Mastiff) to run around, the number of bedroom is for my family when they come visit, I also own several real estate that I have been renting out and make a decent amount of money out of it and the job that I'm currently doing pays in the ranges of mid 6 figures and I get to set my own time, I also have some stock bonds and shares from companies and businesses that I've been investing but even still I'm just doing all of this cause I can and I got nothing better to do, now don't get me wrong I love my dog and house but they are just that; some thing to pass my time with.\n\n5 month ago before the lockdown; I got a knock on my front door at first it was weird who when I open the door I was surprised that it's this girl lets call her Jade. jade is an escort I met when I first came to the state 9 and a half year ago to pursue my Phd, I was ecstatic about the whole idea of having sex for the first time since I spent a lot of my high school and college year prepping for my field of study (Biomedical engineer) and I live most of my life in a rather conservative country in South East Asia and the fact that my family also have a very traditional (my family are of Chinese descent) approach when it comes to having relationship; which means that you only have sex with someone you want to marry even if you're a male as having a child out of wedlock (sometimes accident happens) are very frown upon, my parents have made it very clear to me that as long as I lived a single lives, sex should be the last thing on my mind.\n\nJade has been to me my go to escort if I just want to have sex without going to bar picking up girls I would always call her up, even as an escort she and I connect emotionally. jade and I have known each other for years before I move from Boston to Cali as I finish my Phd and got a job offer here in the west coast before we part ways we had one final sex that lasted for an entire weekend. when Jade show up she was holding 2 little girls she came up to me shaking and immediately ask if she can come in so I obliged and make her a tea to calm her, after drinking she try to reminisce about our past stating that unlike her other client I never make her fell uncomfortable and treated her badly, however as I try to catch up with her she shut me down by diverting the conversation back to stuff about what a good person I am to the point that I feel uncomfortable.\n\nAs I have a meeting in work today I told her that she can stay and make her self feel like home, I then show her the room she and the girls can use and I told her that I'll be back before 5pm, deep down I already know where these is going but I just doesn't know what to do or say. that evening I came home to a clean house and 2 cute little girl laying on the couch watching tv next to my dog and a nice smell of a home cooked meal; an authentic Chinese meal not the one you get at Chinese restaurant in the state which have been modified to please the masses outside of china and a clean kitchen, after we ate she take the girls to clean up and brush their teeth and we all actually sit down and watch TV together before she takes them to bed.\n\nSometimes around 8 after the girls went to bed she told me that we need to talk at first she asked me what do I think about the girls, I told her that I really like hanging out with them and before she can say anything I ask her if they are mine. she breaks down in tears telling me how this past 3 years have been a living hell for her. her parens passed away when she's 12 and she lived with her aunt ever since, that part I know about however what I didn't know is that her cousin are sexually abusive and the moment he found out that she's pregnant he's been physically abusive toward her so she fled out of fear and has been living with her fellow ex-escort friend Cammy, I know Cammy as Jade, her and I once had a threesome together.the moment she gave birth to our daughter, Cammy and her boyfriend have been asking her to go look for me and asked for child support since the two of them have been planing to move in together and start a family, and can no longer have jade living with them and since I don't have a social media presence only Linked-In also I've changed my number many times she has been trying everything to get in touch with me. as soon as they found out about my whereabouts Cammy and Her boyfriend drove her all the way from Boston to Cali with our 2 daughter.\n\nAfter hearing everything that need to be said, she told me that she understand if I didn't believe her and i want a paternity test or even didn't want anything to do with my daughter as my grandfather might disown me. I shut her down and told her that I definitely want a paternity test and if they are really my daughter I will take responsibility, if not I will still support her until she can stand on her own as for my grandad situation (**he is very Traditional**), I told her that since she's half Korean (East Asian), were not in a same sex relationship and the fact that she don't do drug not even smoke, the worst he will do is give the right to the main family estate to my younger brother, which is not a big deal for me anyway since I live in the state the the main family house is in Asia.\n\nImmediately the next three day I make an appointment for a paternity test and the following 2 weeks I got the result and they are mine, I am thrilled we then takes the girls out for some fun and as soon as we arrive home and she put the girls to bed I jumped at her and kissed her like her lips were air and I couldn't get enough of it, she looked at me in shock because the past weeks after we've been reacquainted I had been acting like I don't care. I told her that I've been acting that way to soften the blow in case the kids were not mine and it doesn't matter anyway since I'm still going to adopt them even if they are not mine. I told her how after arriving in Cali I've only had sex twice and never really liked it and for almost 3 years I have basically no sex drive at all until when she came back to me. she looks at me then tears rolls down her eye she, say she loved me and I told her I've loved her since before I moved to Cali and have actually Been contemplating to ask her to move with me but I don't have the guts to do so since I don't know how she feels, we continue to kiss and that night I had the best sex I've ever have in my entire life.\n\nI call my dad the next day and told him everything.

It always made sense to me, but I just realized something that highlighted how true it is.\n\nI started dating my very first girlfriend my junior year of high school, she was a senior. She was actually my sister's good friend, and when my sister went off to college we started talking, and soon after I asked her out. I think I knew even at the time that the odds were completely against this relationship. She was the number 1 student in her class, destined for Ivy League. I had another year at school left, and we would likely (if we stayed together a whole year) be doomed to a 4 year long distance relationship if we tried to make it work.\n\nI went with my heart, and we were madly in love for the next year, but of course it ended after she went away. We only lasted about 4 months long distance, and I agonized about it for the last month. I ended up breaking up with her, but we both knew it was coming. I think I narrowly beat her to the punch. It broke my heart and hers, and at the time I regretted ever letting myself fall in love.\n\n11 years later, and I just thought about her for the first time in God knows how long, maybe months, or years. I realized my perspective is totally changed. I don't remember what the pain felt like. I don't remember missing her, and I certainly don't miss her now. I don't feel the echo of a hole that was left in my life all those year ago, all those relationships ago.\n\nThe only thing I can really remember is the enormous love I felt for her. How sweet and cute she was. Our first kiss, her laying her head on my shoulder or my chest. Laughing until we couldn't breathe (I have no idea about what).The joy I felt sneaking out to meet her, and laying in a field under the stars all night talking about everything we wanted to do, and all the places we wanted to go together, planning trips that we only went on in our imaginations. It was pure and uncomplicated, I haven't spoken to her in probably 10 years, I have no idea where she lives, what she does, what her life is, but she is still a part of me and it's a good part.\n\nJust wanted to share.", "title": "I Just Realized How True An Old Piece of Life Advice I Got, Really Is."}, {"created_utc": 1594223575, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hnjiwb/time_does_strange_things/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "title": "Time Does Strange Things"}, {"created_utc": 1594223103, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hnjdu1/single_m36_lives_in_cali_found_out_i_have_twins/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have something to share as I've been looking for a place to post this story for a while now, this story happens at the beginning of 2020 and my life have never been the same, from just living my life day to day to actually looking forward to the next day.\n\nOkay so where do I start. I've been living a bachelor lives here in California almost 3 years now and to say that I enjoy it is an understatement, i own a 4 bedroom house with a large backyard for gardening and for my dog (Italian Mastiff) to run around, the number of bedroom is for my family when they come visit, I also own several real estate that I have been renting out and make a decent amount of money out of it and the job that I'm currently doing pays in the ranges of mid 6 figures and I get to set my own time, I also have some stock bonds and shares from companies and businesses that I've been investing but even still I'm just doing all of this cause I can and I got nothing better to do, now don't get me wrong I love my dog and house but they are just that; some thing to pass my time with.\n\n5 month ago before the lockdown; I got a knock on my front door at first it was weird who when I open the door I was surprised that it's this girl lets call her Jade. jade is an escort I met when I first came to the state 9 and a half year ago to pursue my Phd, I was ecstatic about the whole idea of having sex for the first time since I spent a lot of my high school and college year prepping for my field of study (Biomedical engineer) and I live most of my life in a rather conservative country in South East Asia and the fact that my family also have a very traditional (my family are of Chinese descent) approach when it comes to having relationship; which means that you only have sex with someone you want to marry even if you're a male as having a child out of wedlock (sometimes accident happens) are very frown upon, my parents have made it very clear to me that as long as I lived a single lives, sex should be the last thing on my mind.\n\nJade has been to me my go to escort if I just want to have sex without going to bar picking up girls I would always call her up, even as an escort she and I connect emotionally. jade and I have known each other for years before I move from Boston to Cali as I finish my Phd and got a job offer here in the west coast before we part ways we had one final sex that lasted for an entire weekend. when Jade show up she was holding 2 little girls she came up to me shaking and immediately ask if she can come in so I obliged and make her a tea to calm her, after drinking she try to reminisce about our past stating that unlike her other client I never make her fell uncomfortable and treated her badly, however as I try to catch up with her she shut me down by diverting the conversation back to stuff about what a good person I am to the point that I feel uncomfortable.\n\nAs I have a meeting in work today I told her that she can stay and make her self feel like home, I then show her the room she and the girls can use and I told her that I'll be back before 5pm, deep down I already know where these is going but I just doesn't know what to do or say. that evening I came home to a clean house and 2 cute little girl laying on the couch watching tv next to my dog and a nice smell of a home cooked meal; an authentic Chinese meal not the one you get at Chinese restaurant in the state which have been modified to please the masses outside of china and a clean kitchen, after we ate she take the girls to clean up and brush their teeth and we all actually sit down and watch TV together before she takes them to bed.\n\nSometimes around 8 after the girls went to bed she told me that we need to talk at first she asked me what do I think about the girls, I told her that I really like hanging out with them and before she can say anything I ask her if they are mine. she breaks down in tears telling me how this past 3 years have been a living hell for her. her parens passed away when she's 12 and she lived with her aunt ever since, that part I know about however what I didn't know is that her cousin are sexually abusive and the moment he found out that she's pregnant he's been physically abusive toward her so she fled out of fear and has been living with her fellow ex-escort friend Cammy, I know Cammy as Jade, her and I once had a threesome together.the moment she gave birth to our daughter, Cammy and her boyfriend have been asking her to go look for me and asked for child support since the two of them have been planing to move in together and start a family, and can no longer have jade living with them and since I don't have a social media presence only Linked-In also I've changed my number many times she has been trying everything to get in touch with me. as soon as they found out about my whereabouts Cammy and Her boyfriend drove her all the way from Boston to Cali with our 2 daughter.\n\nAfter hearing everything that need to be said, she told me that she understand if I didn't believe her and i want a paternity test or even didn't want anything to do with my daughter as my grandfather might disown me. I shut her down and told her that I definitely want a paternity test and if they are really my daughter I will take responsibility, if not I will still help her until she can stand on her own as for my grandad situation (**he is very Traditional**), I told her that since she's half Korean (East Asian), were not in a same sex relationship and the fact that she don't do drug not even smoke, the worst he will do is give the right to the main family estate to my younger brother, which is not a big deal for me anyway since I live in the state the the main family house is in Asia.\n\nImmediately the next three day I make an appointment for a paternity test and the following 2 weeks I got the result and they are mine, I am thrilled we then takes the girls out for some fun and as soon as we arrive home and she put the girls to bed I jumped at her and kissed her like her lips were air and I couldn't get enough of it, she looked at me in shock because the past weeks after we've been reacquainted I had been acting like I don't care. I told her that I've been acting that way to soften the blow in case the kids were not mine and it doesn't matter anyway since I'm still going to adopt them even if they are not mine. I told her how after arriving in Cali I've only had sex twice and never really liked it and for almost 3 years I have basically no sex drive at all until when she came back to me. she looks at me then tears rolls down her eye she, say she loved me and I told her I've loved her since before I moved to Cali and have actually Been contemplating to ask her to move with me but I don't have the guts to do so since I don't know how she feels, we continue to kiss and that night I had the best sex I've ever have in my entire life.\n\nI call my dad the next day and told him everything. I was expecting to get yelled at for starting a family with a prostitute but all my dad ask is that is she still an escort or have she quit her job, I told him she wants to be a stay at home mom, and she agreed to sing a prenup as money is not really a big deal for her and we just want to spend the rest of our lives together. my mom then asked me if I'm happy, I told her yes. they have been having a FaceTime meeting with my fianc\u00e9 (that's right I propose, we will Get married after the pandemic dies down, and she would love to have a traditional Chinese wedding at my hometown), and they love her, they spend the entire afternoon talking about how they think I was gay since I never been in a serious relationship with girls despite being the oldest, while all my other siblings are married at the age of 26 and have at least 2 kids after getting a stable job and are actually glad that I found someone and my parent's cannot wait to meet their granddaughter and as my other siblings as well, our daughters was habit overwhelmed as well after meeting everyone since only know of her mom as their family and now they have this huge family that really loves them an can't wait to meet them. my granddad have asked after looking at my fianc\u00e9 if she's white, I told him she's mixed of Korean-American and she was born here, after a moment of silence he just nods in approval.\n\nNow five months of living together I have never been happier, I have 2 very beautiful, wonderful and smart daughter, an amazing sex life with a wife who loves everything about me and are very eager to learn about my culture and a baby on the way.", "title": "Single (M36) lives in cali.

She pressed the stop button to signal the bus driver her bus stop, where she has to get off when he told her to come up to him. I did not think much of it just thought that she was some kid who drove without a ticket and got busted. Also, did not catch everything from their conversation but could tell that he was worried for her, that she should not be outside past curfew (we are not allowed to be outside in groups at a certain time or there will be a fine to pay) and he somehow knew that she is a minor and said that her parents may get in trouble with the police. This lead to me thinking that I may cause problems too so I asked him if I should get off too. He told me to stay and said that he often sees the same people, often minors, past curfew who are being reckless and not following rules and everything. This lead to thim explaining our countries current rules and laws, which are still to this day confusing to me because they change everyday. All of this lead to a really nice conversation where he asked me what major I am and how I like it and so on. In the end he wished me luck and and a safe way home. I don't know why this made my day.

By this point my boyfriend had already arrived and was downstairs with my dad. I\u2019m just going to assume he said something threatening and intimidating to him like most dads do lol. It\u2019s weird that he (adoptive dad) always says he doesn\u2019t like him, but I think he trusts him to some degree since he\u2019s also one of my best guy friends that I\u2019ve known since first grade and we care about each other deeply. \n\nI came down the stairs and my dad and boyfriend had the biggest smiles on their faces while my heart was racing just hoping I either didn\u2019t fall or that maybe I didn\u2019t look good enough. They were both at a loss for words until my dad just said \u201cBreathtaking\u201d. We took lots of photos and then on we went! Me and my boyfriend waited outside for our other friends to arrive and my best friend looked absolutely amazing, of course. All of my closest friends showed up as well. They did have a social distancing kind of setup where all tables, with only four people to a table, were six feet apart and everyone had to wear a mask when either not dancing or not at their table and just walking around. \n\nI honestly couldn\u2019t tell you the amount of times my boyfriend told me how beautiful I was; we almost never let go of each other\u2019s hands the whole night. But it was nice just being around my friends once again since we only do in-class attendance twice a month for taking tests. If I\u2019m being completely honest, I was more looking forward just to being around them more than anything, they\u2019re basically my other family. It was also nice talking with my teachers so casually for once and getting to talk to them like regular people. But probably my favorite part of the night was, of course, the slow dance. There aren\u2019t enough words to describe how precious this moment was for us. Just being this close to him without either my parents or his in the next room and just being right here and now was nice. Aside from staring at each other with huge smiles, we talked, complimented each other on how we looked, laughed about whatever and then kissed. It was fucking spectacular. \n\nAnd that was pretty much that! Our principal did make an announcement that hopefully we\u2019d all be back to regular schooling starting in August, so that was great to hear. Rest of the night was pretty boring though and we all went our separate ways back home and my dad picked me up. My boyfriend also waited with me and wouldn\u2019t go with his parents until my dad came. I\u2019ve probably said it already, but I\u2019m really glad I went and got to be with all of my friends in one place again.

I let many relationship fade away over the past few years. Last year in april I started to realize that there are problems in my life and over the following months I started to see that I don't have to face them alone. I am slowly learning how to share moments of weakness and suffering, but it is a long road. It's getting better.\n\nMy brother is younger than me but I always felt like he was doing better in life than me, especially socially. I wasn't sure if he wanted to reconnect with me even though we used to be very close as children. I forgot about our close past in the troubles of puberty, I guess. But I called him yesterday. He didn't have time then but wrote that he was happy to hear from me and today we talked for an hour and it felt like 5 minutes and so close like the last few years didn't ever happen. He is doing okay, he struggles financially, but manages it somehow, he told me about his projects (he is a musician) and how he broke up with his girlfriend recently. I was able to talk about myself in a normal way, I wasn't painting my life in bright colors like I do sometimes when I am scared to share weakness, but I also didn't make fun of my struggles in an unhealthy way, as I also tend to do. I also told him about the good parts of my life. At the end, he said that he really wants to see me again. I wasn't at my parents last christmas and when I visited them afterwards, he was already gone and with covid it was hard to see each other lately so we didn't meet for over a year now. But I think I will visit my parents this christmas to see my brother.\n\nI can't express how much this means to me. I am so happy. I was scared we alienated each other because when we met since I moved out, we never really connected, but it turns out we both want this relationship back, so it is there, it's as easy as that.

When I was in the second grade I had a thyroid problem which made me gain tons of weight in a little amount of time. I was an obese child and teen getting made fun of and picked on at school. When I got into high school I had friends and went out sometimes but being obese it was hard enjoying certain activities. The day I was at the doctors office I made a commitment to change, after the doctor told me being 395 pounds was not at all good for my health. I started on the Atkins diet eating lean meats, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. I started out walking for exercise but grew to love other forms of exercise such as weight lifting, yoga, aerobics, and especially jogging. In 8 months I lost 100 pounds I graduated high school with people amazed by the way I was looking I kept going and by the time I turned 21 I had lost 270 plus pounds. I was thrilled but had lots of excess skin on my body especially my tummy. I ended up getting skin removal surgery, which was painful but worth it. I think back at this goal and get very very happy. I never stopped loving exercise, I worked out the whole time I was pregnant. I'm currently training for my dream career for a better life for my son. Thinking back to this huge achievement I accomplished gives me the strength to train for my career. This makes me extremely happy, finally I shared my past with people instead of hiding it.

We have friends in common so I see her sometimes at parties, we played in a rpg together, we're in good terms overall but nothing to write home about, really.\n\nThere's this week where we go every evening to different bars, to give an opportunity for the newcomers at the uni to meet the other students. Of course I went, and of course she went.\n\nYesterday evening, I might have drank just a little bit. She went to ask me a question when she was leaving and (I'm certain there was a logical reason but I can't remember it) I ended up telling her that yeah, she's a great person and I would love to get to know her. She didn't really reacted. \n\nI realized during the night that it was a dumb move on my part. I don't know what I was expecting.\n\nToday, I spend most of the evening acting like yesterday never happened. We were cordial but I didn't wanted to get back on the topic. There was nothing more to say, right?\n\nAnyways I drank a bit again and I was here challenging people to arm wrestling. I don't know why, but I asked her, and she accepted. We had had to move in a corner of the bar to find a suitable table to do it. I won and we started discussing about gender roles or whatever. Anyways, she brought up what I said yesterday. I comfort her that I took some time to think it through, and it was just me forgetting to just shut the fuck up and she shouldn't worry about it. She asked me \"why?\" I told her that I don't know what I was expecting, going to her while not really knowing her first.\n\nShe told me that she felt the same, kinda attracted but she would like to get to know me better first.\n\nIf that's not a girl asking you to a date I don't know what is.\n\nAnyways, after this bar marathon is over, we plan to have a date together and see where it goes.\n\nI'm just fucking happy because we played a rpg together for a year. If she saw me yell about my Dream Body spell while making mildly offensive jokes about cat people in Tamriel and still think \"I find this man attractive\", then I know I can be myself with her and it won't be a problem.\n\nWhat makes me smile like an idiot is that, when she finally went to leave, I told her \"see you tomorrow\", and \"I can't wait to see you again\". And she fucking said \"me too\" with that cute shy smile after a second. Every time I think about it my heart melts a little more.

During my freshman year of college, I was introduced to a guy who played on the baseball team and I quickly fell in love with him. After three years of dating, he proposed and we wed in a beautiful ceremony at the church both my parents and grandparents had married. We soon welcomed a beautiful baby boy and four years later, another son.\n\nI don\u2019t want to focus extensively on the falling of our marriage, so I\u2019ll try to keep it short and simple. After having our second son, things became tense. My ex no longer seemed to want the responsibility of being a father to our two young boys. He stayed out late after work and would go straight to sleep upon arriving home. For the sake of our two very young children. I stayed in the marriage for as long as I could. I eventually learned that he was having multiple affairs and came to the conclusion that I needed to get out. \n\nI was granted sole custody of our boys and we moved back home to be closer to my parents. Occasionally, my parents would force me to go on social outings with friends for the sake of my own sanity. My hometown friends had made lots of new connections since I had left town, so nearly every outing I was meeting new people and making new friends. \n\nDuring one of our \u2018girls night out\u2019 I was seated next to a very tall woman whom I had not met before. We ended up talking nearly the entire night away and I instantly felt a bond between us. I learned that she was the Vice President of a rather large company and that she had worked all the way up from the CEOs personal assistant to his number two executive. I was beyond impressed and became even more intrigued. Subsequently, I learned she was only a year older than me, yet she had never been married and had no children.\n\nWe exchanged phone numbers and promised to keep in touch. I figured that I had just made another friendship, but this one felt different. She was so down to earth and didn\u2019t gossip about others the entire night, which was a breath of fresh air. She seemed like a genuinely good person with a good head on her shoulder and that was exactly the type of person I wanted to befriend during a period where I was already under enough stress. \n\nWe soon started meeting up, just the two of us, and I learned even more about her personal life. She revealed to me that she was gay and had known since she was just eight years old. She had come out of the closet years ago but hadn\u2019t had a serious relationship since high school. A spouse and kids were something she always wanted, but she felt it may never happen. I consoled her and opened up more about my own struggles over the past few years.\n\nWithin just a few months of knowing each other, we became best friends. We did something together nearly every weekend and she would come over to my place after work to play with the kids (who quickly came to adore her) and give me some \u2018rest time\u2019. I somehow didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but she was trying to make the point that she loved my boys and would do anything to be with me and raise them as her own.\n\nIt was during a lunch outing one afternoon that she revealed her feelings towards me. She told me that she didn\u2019t want it to change our relationship, but felt that it needed to be said that romance was on her mind. I told her that I needed to think about it. Quickly, I saw her facial expression go from nervous to sad. I started to think about everything in my head at that moment. Deep down, I had developed feelings for her as well. It was all just so confusing to me. I had never been into another woman like that and besides her, I could not find another woman \u2018attractive\u2019 even if I wanted to. \n\nI thought about all she had done for me and how great she was with my boys. Looking at her sad face, I grabbed her arm and told her that I wanted to be more than friends. Her expression changed to a mixture of shock and delight. I told her to ask me out. She did and we went on our first date the next evening. \n\nThings only got better from that point on. Our friends were shocked but beyond ecstatic for us upon hearing the news. She held my hand everywhere we went and always made it a point to declare that I was her girlfriend. I thought it was the cutest thing that she was obsessed with me. That\u2019s when I realized that we were probably going to get married. I had never had any interest in a woman prior to meeting her and now here I was on the verge of being married to one.\n\nShe proposed on our one year anniversary. We married in the most amazing destination wedding just seven months later. I quickly became pregnant and we welcomed our first daughter ten months after the wedding. Since then, we\u2019ve welcomed five more daughters and I have a seventh in my belly as we speak! Three years ago, my wife was promoted to CEO of her company. Despite holding such a powerful position, she always puts plenty of time aside for the kids and myself. I am beyond proud of her and honestly just honored to be able to do life with such an amazing person. \n\nI must say that I don\u2019t even see or think about her gender anymore. It\u2019s all pure love. We are soulmates. It\u2019s a type of love and emotion I never felt with a guy and sure wouldn\u2019t ever feel with any other woman. I love her for her and that\u2019s the most amazing feeling to be in love with someone just purely from the heart.", "title": "The story of how a single mother fell in love with another woman."}, {"created_utc": 1627933880, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/owmcxg/last_may_i_met_my_best_friend_from_a_playstation/", "num_comments": 97, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Last May I met my best friend from a Playstation game and randomly grouped up, now we are dating and I couldn't be happier, life has a crazy way of working out and I'm so blessed!

I thought it would be interesting to do something with this, to add a bit of joy to the process.\n\nSo in Happy Style game levels for Relaxation were born, where in response to finger movements on the touch screen warm words appear: compliments from Happy Style or loved ones, the user's dreams, victories, wisdoms and even\u2026 complete nonsense. The goal is simple - to relax and enjoy the process.\n\nSometimes application sends notifications with a warm word, wisdom, a dream, or the achievement of its user - it's nice to remember that you are worth something.\n\nHappy Style has already contains more than 1000 kind words for both men and women, as well as about 1000 wise quotes from great people.

Since I am a student I am not eligible to get the short-time unemployment benefit which is about 60% of your usual pay. \n\nToday I got the news that my city decided, that the inclusion aides can go to the kid\u2019s houses and homeschool them if the parents want and need the service.\n\nI just got the call from the mum who told me they would like to do that, if I am up for it. Since the dad works shifts and the mum works mornings, I will go there every second week starting May 4th! \n\nI am super excited that I finally get to do what I love again and of course that I will be getting paid again!! \n\n\nI hope all of your are happy, healthy and safe.

For example, the alertness that a soldier has during battle is totally appropriate and can keep them alive, but for a veteran re-entering society, that alertness becomes paranoia, and is a detriment to their social lives.\n\nAs a result of my three years of being in the proverbial trenches myself, I am not quick to trust people.

But now, I feel like sometimes I'm hyper-vigilant. I hate liars and people who take advantage of others, and if there's even a tiny inkling that someone is that kind of person, then I stay away from them. But I feel like this \"filter\" that I have also sometimes filters out good people too.  Having been hurt by so many people makes me not really want to be social at all - I'd rather swallow a handful of grapes all at once than talk about the weather. I've also just had 3 large friendships end over the last 2 years because they were lying to me in some *really major* way, or taking advantage of me, so I'm very cautious. What's weird is that I work a room really well, make people laugh, and do some public speaking stuff(and I'm told I'm pretty darn good at it). So people insist that I'm an extrovert because I'm charismatic and great at networking and socializing, but in reality, it really drains me unless there's something to gain from it (a new client, potential job, a passion of mine that I'm volunteering for, etc.) and Id rather be home cuddling with my dog and watching Unnus Annus.\n\nI decided to be a lot more social now that COVID has hit. Even though I'm kind of antisocial, it doesn't mean that I'm not lonely. I've been doing pretty good at it too! I'm making it a point to actually follow-up with people that I used to talk to, but my time trying to survive homelessness made it too hard to keep up with those relationships. I now have a new friend I've met on Reddit that I chat with every day, and she's super neat, and another girl who's in the same field as me (also met through Reddit) that I'm going to visit through Animal Crossing, as well as some of my mentors that I usually only talked to about work stuff that I'm now working on developing personal relationships with. Those have been going awesome! And I'm working with my therapist to address the underlying issues that make it hard for me to make friends. I just talked for two and a half hours last night with this senior developer (I'm a junior software developer) that I met once because we were both stranded on a train that managed to crap out on us haha. It was so nice to both chat with someone that had a similar mindset as me AND worked in the same field as me.  I feel like this has all been affecting my mood in a really positive way, and it's a little scary, but I plan to keep it up c:", "title": "I've actually started to make friends for the first time in a few years!"}, {"created_utc": 1590757477, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gssndu/need_your_opinion_on_a_multiplayer_music_quiz_game/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Need your opinion on a multiplayer music quiz game"}, {"created_utc": 1590755930, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gss8n2/an_ode_to_our_happy_yet_sometimes_bratty_kids/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "An ode to our happy, yet sometimes bratty, kids!"}, {"created_utc": 1590755166, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gss1n6/my_daughter_suffered_with_one_of_the_worst_pain/", "num_comments": 77, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "My daughter suffered with one of the worst pain disorders known.

I had many plans, I felt like I was the greatest person alive where I helped a lot who had problems. I was very curious about the stories of everyone, helped people though, their family problems, heartbreaks, depression etc. I was so obsessed on knowing everything about myself. My personality, my future, my values, my dreams, my motivations. I felt so excited and nervous about my future which made my head hurt. I had many ideas and theories such as; what is on the edge of the universe, the existence of everything, how Christianity might disappear from the future, aliens, extraterrestrial beings. I even had plans of becoming a famous philosopher or being a therapist who saves people from suicide. I wrote a lot on my journal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**During my extreme lows:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything started going down, I lost energy and started sleeping more than 12 hours a day, my extreme happiness and excitement was replaced with sadness, feelings of being unlovable, hopeless. I forgot everything about me, who I was as a person, my dreams, basically everything about me and I felt empty. I started to question if I should still continue my life or not and I had suicidal thoughts. I isolated from everyone and stopped attending online classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How I recovered and what I have learned from my problems:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where I figured out who were the people who were truly there for me, my friends noticed that I haven't been talking to them anymore and that I wasn't attending online classes. They started messaging and calling me a lot to ask me if I was okay. This was when I told them everything. I also started telling my grandmother and other relatives. The amount of support I got was a lot.\n\nThey reminded me of who I was and thanked me for everything, told me that I would always bring out the best in them, inspire them, help them trough their heartbreaks, family problems, by being a good listener and giving advice. They said that I was smart, empathetic, open-minded, never judged people, soft-hearted. A relative of mine who was a psychologist even told me that she admires me for my emotional intelligence, kindness, and self-awareness, my great ability to read and see through people at the age of 15. I was told to continue my dreams of being a therapist where I could inspire and save others and brighten their day.\n\nMy highs have given me a lot of insights about a lot of stuff due to the racing thoughts I had. I know what its like to be so happy and excitable where you feel like you are on the top of the world and feel like you can do anything and that life will be all good and happy. I felt anxiety where you would jump into different possibilities and felt uneasy due to the uncertainty.\n\nMy lows made me experience depression which is a thing many are experiencing, I know what its like to feel like you are unlovable and alone. I know what its like to struggle and try so hard to get out of bed to do anything, get frustrated because you cant concentrate and finish anything. Depression makes you feel like you are sinking in a dark bottomless pit while you start to forget everything about yourself, it tricks you into believing that nobody loves you and that you are alone and life will only get worse for you.\n\nIt helped me empathize with people better because it enabled me to feel emotions strongly and deeply. It has given me an ambition to be a therapist and help other people who are struggling too because I know what its like to feel like you are in a rollercoaster of emotions. It made me realize that our struggles are what makes us strong and resilient. My struggles made a huge impact on me into becoming resilient and emotionally intelligent. I can use my story to let others know that in the darkest moment of our life, there is light, there is hope, and that our problems are what makes us human and strong. We may feel like we are alone, but there are many others out there who are struggling too. I look forward into growth, maturity, and more intelligence.", "title": "(M15) How my struggles had help me know who I am as a person and how it made me strong and grow more as a person.

I don\u2019t think she accounted for the weekend but that\u2019s okay. While I was filling out my paperwork, she stepped into her office and took a phone call and I could overhear some of the conversation. I\u2019m assuming she was speaking with the owners of the facility because they talked about interviewees. I didn\u2019t hear my name specifically come up in conversation but I could tell they were talking about me because they talked about my exact employment history and experience and she said really positive stuff to whoever was on the opposing end and even said I was a worthy candidate. \n\nI sent a follow up/thank you email 2 days ago. And now I\u2019ve been anxiously playing the waiting game of hearing back. She did say they weren\u2019t rushing to choose because they wanted to make a good choice and she also said no matter the outcome they would contact me so I wasn\u2019t left wondering. \nBut man, I\u2019m so impatient and this job would be so good for me in so many aspects. \n\nAny good/positive vibes that I get offered the job would be GREATLY appreciated. \u2764\ufe0f", "title": "Now accepting positive vibes for a job that I interviewed for recently"}, {"created_utc": 1644434590, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/soll66/i_will_be_going_to_france_for_a_year_as_an_au_pair/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "A month ago i had no idea what i was going to do after\ni'm done with school and i was really stressing about it.\nWhile i was on vacation i got a message from a teacher\nsaying he knows someone who needs an Au Pair and\nwether my classmates and me were interested.

It wasn't in his hands but I still felt bummed because we rarely get to see each other. We had this whole thing planned for us today where we were going to have lunch and stuff. So I asked my granny not to make anything for me. I told her id be eating out and coming home in a couple of hours. Since he cancelled I had to eat out side alone. I hated the thought of it because I really wanted to spend time with him. I knew that if I sat alone, my thoughts would lead to something saddening. I had noodles, and went to this patisserie to have dessert. \n\nThat's when I saw, sitting at a table all alone was a white guy around my age (18). I approached him and asked if I sat at his table and he didn't mind. We started talking and he turned out to be a 30 year old, married and with a kid. Trust me, he did NOT look any older than 20. I was taken aback a little because I wouldn't have approached him had I known he was like 12 years older. Anywho, we started talking and hit it right off. He was interested in everything I spoke about and added to the conversation. I just felt this natural flow to our vibe that I liked a lot. We spoke for a while and after we were done having food, he asked if I wanted to check out a park nearby that he heard about. I was like yes sure, and we put on google maps and started making our way to the park. \n\nTurns out, it was shut down and we had to go back. On the way back we saw a bunch of rocks and trees and maps called it 'rock garden' , so we went there because it looked interesting. It wasn't much. Just six rocks in a tiny area and not much to climb. We sat down on the rocks and just stared inti the sky and spoke about all kinds of things. He was perfectly decent and was a really good listener with a friendly and nice sense of humour. He showed me pictures of his adorable kid and wife, and I showed him a picture of my brother seeing snow for the first time. It was so wholesome. \n\nAfter spending some time on the rocks, we walked back to the patisserie and went to a mall nearby. I showed him a pretty lantern that I always loved looking at whenever I went, and he liked it so much, he bought it. We laughed a lot, casually spoke while walking around the mall and then I took him to a place that sold rolls. He never had the type they sell in my country and he really liked it. \n\nAfter speaking to each other for some more time, I took him to the metro. He works with railways, and he was very interested to know how the metro works innmy country and how it's different from his country's. I had to go back home and I frequently travel by the metro so I took him to the station. \n\nThat's when we had to part ways. He was travelling to the opposite side and I had to go back home. He gave me a super tight, long hug, told me he was really glad he met me and that he had an amazing time. \n\nAnd just like that, my sad day turned into an unexpectedly happy ass one", "title": "A foreigner flipped my bad day into a great one"}, {"created_utc": 1644352957, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/snuaz7/waitress_remembered_my_order_first_time_this_has/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "Whenever I hang out with a friend and we want to go out to eat, I bring us to a local diner.

This was mainly due to trying to accommodate everyone elses' wants and feelings on the matter. My partner has a big family with traditional outlooks, my family consists of a few close friends and lots of out-of-towners. My partner is very close with my formed-family. We agreed to do a small celebration amongst us (we all do yearly trips anyways, so it would probably be during one of those). We aren't sure how my partner's large family will accept this news.

I accidentally got exactly what I wanted on a total fluke. I have a great job, don't get me wrong. I hired on as a project manager, I have spent many successful years doing large campus style construction projects for my company. So far in my career I have never run an unsuccessful project (that's a lie I had one bad one but hey who's counting). Most of them are huge construction efforts. Projects that are 1,000,000 square feet or more or multi building efforts that typically run concurrently. It's a lot to handle but that's ok, apparently, somehow, I have the tools to do so and I have an amazing team. But the problem has been for a number of years- I absolutely hate the work. I loathe sitting on one job for years at a time. I don't have the massive sized contract drive that do many project managers in my field do. Just not my thing. Well flash forward to Friday, I went into home office to get some blue prints printed off and to have a quick Convo with my boss. The president of the company asked me to come into his office (here it comes, I'm getting fired). He says (paraphrasing) \"hey I know you know we've been doing a lot of restructuring and.....\" Fuck! Here it comes, things have been funky, a bit slow because of covid and such, I'm screwed. (Or so I thought). \" He says how do you feel about transitioning in to take over the service department?\" Holy shit!!! I've been trying to figure out how to make this exact thing happen for the last two years. Raking my brain over the coals to figure out timing, how best to approach it, how to not rock the boat or make my boss think I hate working for him (I do but he's a pretty good guy, just a bit weird). WTF!!  HOLY FREAKING CELEBRATION BATMAN!! I love service work, it's all high speed low drag, inconsistent, hard, weird, new everything every day, never the same thing. And generally I can make the same profit doing half or less of the scale of work I was doing before in half the time.

After struggling with depression and anxiety all my life, I felt hopeless,  inadequate and just stagnant with the things I was doing. I'm getting older this year and I want to choose happiness, self love and affirmations in this next chapter. A year and a half ago I started this podcast called \"One Time For A Good Time\" talking about the insecurities and hardships the everyday person goes through. I didn't think anything would come from it,  I just wanted to create a platform and put myself out there but over the years everything became therapeutic for me. I began to pour my heart out, get listeners and eventually I would get emails from people expressing how I saved their life in some way. It was amazing seeing the difference I brought into the world.  So many of us has been going through rough times recently and I think it's important that we have communities where we can build together and just focus on getting on the right path. I don't know if anyone is interested but here's my podcast,  I hope we together can go through 2022 trying to make ourselves feel a little bit better \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70 if you've gotten this far in the post, I really just want to say I love you and thank you so much for hearing me out.

All while my boyfriend of 3 years (4 this November)and I grew up.\n\nThere have been days, weeks, and even months where I thought I was a complete failure, in anything I did. But now, I have a full time job. And i signed an NDA , but it\u2019s the easiest, laziest job in the world at that. Just checking and record keeping. I won! \n\n\nMy relationship is wonderful, my long term boyfriend and I just got out first apartment together this year, smack in the middle of Center City Philadelphia. I\u2019m getting an education again, while my partner kisses my forehead every night and loves to sit down and just vibe with me everyday. We go to the movies, play video games, cat nap and just go take walks. There was a time when I never thought him and I would make it. Not alone living in the city. A time when I thought arguments meant it was over, and he\u2019d shut down before I could even notice something was off. \n\nWe both are getting mental help now, and last night we discussed the possibility of getting married by the end of this year. It\u2019ll be four years. Four fucking crazy ass years of being with him. Four years of learning everything about one another, and learning what real communication looks like. \n\nMy mother doesn\u2019t like him because she\u2019s in denial that I don\u2019t need her anymore. His mother doesn\u2019t like me, because she wants him for herself. And they\u2019ve admitted (by accident) it was because of jealousy. It only made us realize we will never be supported, no matter how well we\u2019re doing. \nAnd neither of us speak to our fathers anymore, but last we decided we\u2019re going to try and work on that too. \n\nWe didn\u2019t realize how independent we\u2019ve been from everything we used to know and follow. In our minds, we\u2019re still 16 and walking on eggshells. But we\u2019re both 22 now, full time jobs, getting whatever we want and coming back home to just one another every night. \n\nNow our families ask US for help. Now suddenly we get the random \u201cI love and miss you\u201d messages and calls and \u201cwe\u2019re so proud of you both.\u201d \n\nI have the job that I want, and work for the government at that. And our savings are steadily growing at the perfect rate. Either this year, or in two years, we may start our own business. We aren\u2019t in a rush, we are stable and just want to make sure we have more money before we start having children. And what\u2019s crazy, is that I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d hear my mom say it, but Im doing so well in life for my age, she even said if I had a baby, she knew I could provide everything for my child despite my age. The fact that I\u2019d just be a \u201cyoung mom\u201d and not a naive one/ignorant one, really made me forgive my mom. What\u2019s crazier, is that I make more money than my parents now, without a college degree.\n\nI cried and did everything I could to get this job and make this kind of money. Im literally sitting in an office for 6 out of the 8 hours of real work. Im beyond blessed. And the fact my partner just wants to invest in our savings / and have fun with it while he pays for all of our bills makes me want to cry randomly at times too. He knows I fully have his back, and he confided in me last night that the reason his parents marriage had failed, was because his mother left everything for the father to handle, and his father snapped. And he said from the beginning of our relationship, he knew I was a hard worker, but didn\u2019t appreciate it enough because he thought what his father went through would be repeated with me. We had a moment in 2021 where I told him he could happily fuck off and I immediately just went back to work, and he said he realized he just had a lot of pent up fears and mommy issues to work on. And when he went to talk to his mother about it, and how serious he was to make it work with me, she cursed my name and lied saying I tried to fight her and screamed at her. I\u2019ve only seen this woman twice. He called her out and she hung up on him. It\u2019s been\u2026. A ride.\n\nBut We\u2019re young and make good money Our savings are beautiful. We\u2019re slowly trying to make friends again, and planning for a business/ family in the next few years. \n\nI miss our old friends, but even now I have to accept they didn\u2019t want anything to do with me, they just wanted the benefits of having me around.

The brahmin\n\nAkkosaka Bharadvaja, Bharadvaja the Abusive, heard \"It is\n\nsaid that the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan has gone forth from\n\nthe household life into homelessness under the ascetic Gotama.\"\n\n**Angry** and displeased, he approached the Blessed One and\n\nabused and reviled him with rude, harsh words.\n\nWhen he had finished speaking, the Blessed One said to him:\n\n\"What do you think, brahmin?

But we do not partake of your meal; we do not enter\n\nupon an exchange. It still belongs to you, brahmin!\"\n\n\"The king and his retinue understand the ascetic Gotama to be\n\nan arahant, yet Master Gotama still gets angry.\"\n\n(Note: Some sources said:\n\n\u2026 yet, Do Master Gotama still gets angry?)\n\n\\[The Blessed One:\\]\n\n\"How can anger arise in one who is angerless,\n\nIn the tamed one of righteous living, \n\nIn one liberated by perfect knowledge,\n\nIn the Stable One who abides in peace?\n\n\"One who repays an angry man with anger\n\nThereby makes things worse for himself.\n\nNot repaying an angry man with anger,\n\nOne wins a battle hard to win.\n\n\"He practises for the welfare of both-\n\nHis own and the other's-\n\nWhen, knowing that his foe is **angry,**\n\nHe mindfully maintains his peace.\n\n(Note: Some sources said:\n\nHe/she who knows the other is angry and can still his mind and be conscious,\n\nit can be said that he/she does for benefits of both parties that are him/herself and the other.)\n\n\"When he achieves the cure of both-\n\nHis own and the other's-\n\nThe people who consider him a fool\n\nAre unskilled in the Dhamma.\"\n\n(Note: Some sources said:\n\nWhen he/she preserve the benefits of both parties that are him/herself and the other,\n\nthose who are not intelligent in Dhamma will think that he/she is a fool.)\n\nWhen this was said, the brahmin Akkosaka Bharadvaja said to\n\nthe Blessed One: \"Magnificent, Master Gotama!. . . I go for refuge\n\nto Master Gotama, and to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu\n\nSangha. May I receive the going forth under Master Gotama,\n\nmay I receive the higher ordination!'\n\nThen the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan received the going\n\nforth under the Blessed One, he received the higher ordination.\n\nAnd soon, not long after his higher ordination, dwelling alone\n\n... ... the Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the\n\narahants.\n\nFrom: Tipitaka, Suttapitaka (A new Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya, The Connected Discourses of the Buddha, Bhikkhu Bodhi: Brahmanasamyutta, Page 255: 2 (2) Abuse)\n\n///////////////\n\nThe above is the second Sutta in Brahmanasamyutta. I (writer) will now talk about 1st \u2013 5th Sutta which are also directly related to the matters of anger (5 out of 10 Suttas so to keep this article short and brief).\n\nThe first Sutta said about the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan. He saw Dhananjani praised and had confidence in the Blessed One, he then tried to go and refuted with the Blessed One. Angry and displeased, he asked:\n\n\"Having slain what makes one sleep soundly?\n\nHaving slain what makes one not sorrow?\n\nWhat is the one thing, O Gotama,\n\nWhose killing you approve?\"\n\n\\[The Blessed One:\\]\n\n\"Having slain anger, one sleeps soundly;\n\nHaving slain anger, one does not sorrow;\n\nThe killing of anger, O brahmin,\n\nWith its poisoned root and honeyed tip:\n\nThis is the killing the noble ones praise,\n\nFor having slain that, one does not sorrow.\"\n\nThe brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.\n\n(Then in 2nd Sutta above, Akkosa then angry (probably because the 1st is his friend? And Akkosa didn\u2019t like it when a friend started believing in something else / someone else :D) and came meet the Buddha, angrily.)\n\nThe Third Sutta, Asurindaka, in Brahmanasamyutta said about The Brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja.\n\nAsurindaka Bharadvaja also heard the same as Akkosaka. He then came with anger and displeased to abused (scolded) the Blessed One. When he finished, the Blessed One remained silent, he continued: \"You're beaten, ascetic! You're beaten, ascetic!\"\n\n\\[The Blessed One:\\]\n\n\"The fool thinks victory is won \n\nWhen, by speech, he bellows harshly;\n\nBut for one who understands,\n\nPatient endurance is the true victory.\u201d\n\n(Some sources said:\n\nThose who speak rude words thinks he/she has won.\n\nBut Patient endurance is the true victory for the wise one.)\n\n(From here same as Akkosa)\n\n\"One who repays an angry man with anger\n\nThereby makes things worse for himself.\n\nNot repaying an angry man with anger,\n\nOne wins a battle hard to win.\n\n\"He practises for the welfare of both-\n\nHis own and the other's-\n\nWhen, knowing that his foe is **angry,**\n\nHe mindfully maintains his peace.\n\n\"When he achieves the cure of both-\n\nHis own and the other's-\n\nThe people who consider him a fool\n\nAre unskilled in the Dhamma.\"\n\nAsurindaka Bharadvaja then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.\n\nThe 4th Sutta said about The Brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja. He also heard the same as Akkosaka. Angry and displeased, he approached the Blessed One and silently stood to one side.\n\nThen the Blessed One knew his thought and said to him:\n\n\"If one wrongs an innocent man,\n\nA pure person without blemish,\n\nThe evil falls back on the fool himself,\n\nlike fine dust thrown against the wind.\"\n\n(Some sources said:\n\nHe/she who harms one, who harms no one, who is pure, who has no desire.\n\nThe sin will definitely return to him/herself who is Rascal.\n\nJust like those who throw fine dust against the wind.)\n\nThe Brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.\n\nThe 5th Sutta said about The Brahmin Ahimsaka Bharadvaja. (This one wasn\u2019t angry at the Buddha.)\n\nHe said to the Blessed One: \"I am Ahimsaka the Harmless, Master Gotama. I am Ahimsaka the Harmless, Master Gotama.\"\n\n\\[The Blessed One:\\]\n\n\"If one were as one's name implies\n\nYou would be a harmless one.\n\nBut it is one who does no harm at all\n\nBy body, speech, or mind,\n\nWho really is a harmless one\n\nAs he does not harm others.\"\n\n(Some sources said:\n\n\"If his/her name is Ahimsaka,\n\nHe/she should not harm others.\n\nHe/she who truly does no harm via body, speech, or mind,\n\nhis/her name truly is Ahimsaka\")\n\nNote: By now, we can understand that Ahimsaka means A harmless one.\n\nThe Brahmin Ahimsaka Bharadvaja then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.\n\nRecap/Summary:\n\n1st Sutta: Eliminate anger / Don\u2019t get angry, and one will be happy.\n\n2nd Sutta: Don\u2019t exchange angrily with those who angry at you.\n\n3rd Sutta: Patient endurance is the true victory for the wise one.\n\n4th Sutta: Sin / bad Results sill return to those who harm others. (Which the bad results will be explained more in other suttas)\n\n5th Sutta: To truly be a harmless one, one must not harm others via body, speech, or mind.\n\nA bit Extra: And to achieve this, one must also practice his/her mind by meditation.\n\nEnd: When the Buddha was scolded.\n\nWritten by Plik the Cat \u2013 Feb 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/guyoka045em41.png?width=1254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17d82cb11352906962002942604c921da0a53566\n\nSupport writer: [https://www.patreon.com/plikthecat](https://www.patreon.com/plikthecat)\n\nReference:\n\n\\-Akkosa Sutta: Insult - translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu\n\n[https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn07/sn07.002.than.html](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn07/sn07.002.than.html)\n\n\\- Tipitaka, Suttapitaka (A new Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya, The Connected Discourses of the Buddha, Bhikkhu Bodhi: Brahmanasamyutta, Page 255: 2 (2) Abuse)\n\n\\- E-Tipitaka program (v3.0.9)", "title": "When the Buddha was scolded - the Path to happiness"}, {"created_utc": 1584083775, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fhvs3u/my_boy_finally_did_it/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "My boy finally did it."}, {"created_utc": 1584083733, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fhvrvu/when_the_buddha_was_scolded/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "When the Buddha was scolded."}, {"created_utc": 1584079259, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fhv1gp/just_a_cheesy_lil_thing3/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": " my partner fell asleep while holding my arm and hand and i had to gently pry it off to go use the bathroom. i didn\u2019t even wake him! i\u2019m usually the one to fall asleep first, so it feels so nice to experience this. i\u2019m right where i wanna be. \n... except for when i gotta piss. love to all. hope u have to pry a sleeping loved one off ya soon. it\u2019s so fucking cute. i think i\u2019ve found the love of my life. actually.", "title": "just a cheesy lil thing&lt;3"}, {"created_utc": 1584072056, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fhtpmg/20_years_ago_i_left_met_this_guy_right_online/", "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "20 years ago I (left) met this guy (right) online playing Team Fortress Classic. 10 years ago he traveled from Norway to visit me in Canada and we took this photo.

I lost my best friend of 6 years\nbecause we grew apart, my friend who I met at class seems socially awkward and we only talk about schoolwork and memes. I tried to initiate something else as a conversation, didn't work.

The American Psychiatric Association classifies it as a dissociative disorder, a class of mental health conditions that disrupt memory, awareness, identity or perception. People who have depersonalization-derealization disorder feel disconnected from their mind or body (depersonalization) or their surroundings (derealization). This leads to the people who suffer from it to have chronic anxiety and depression, which inevitably disrupts every aspect of their lives.\nUp to 75% of people experience at least one depersonalization/derealization episode in their lives, and approximately 2% meet the full criteria to classify it as a chronic disorder.

Someone asked me the craziest stuff I've had here on Reddit and told about the guy who sent me a whole box of American snacks for free. Told him as a joke that I really craved some Jalape\u00f1o &amp; Cheddar Cheez-Its again, since I looked everywhere in my country and I couldn't get them unless I imported them for so much dough. Turns out, he's a philanthropist in his spare time too and **offered me also to ship some Cheez-Its!!** Once again I thought that this guy might actually be pulling my leg, but three weeks passed and it turned out I was wrong yet again.\n\nUnfortunately, he could only find one box of Jalape\u00f1o &amp; Cheddar Cheez-Its (he wasn't from the US, rather he got them at a local shop in the UK) so he sent over about 8 boxes of Cheez-Its to compensate! I really loved the Bacon &amp; Cheddar, I didn't expect to find those so delicious lmao. I honestly wouldn't have expected that two total strangers would be so kind to me, but I guess it's people like these that make the world a better place honestly.

I know you won\u2019t have time to read this in the morning, and that\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t sleep again. Insomnia really sucks. I was thinking about us though. A lot, actually. You make me happy. Really happy. And I know that I make you happy too. It\u2019s hard for me to accept that, that someone can be happy as a result of being with me. I\u2019ve spent the majority of my life just trying not to be a nuisance to people around me. But seeing your smile every time you look at me reminds me every day that I make you happier. I am so glad I can do that for you. When I am with you my life is so much better. I love that we can share our innermost insecurities, tell our most closely held secrets, and still not look at each other any differently. I never want that to change. I also love the fact that we are best friends. We can get really romantic and cute, or intimate and physical, but at the end of the day we still are the same dumb and goofy best friends we\u2019ve always been. I\u2019m glad that our relationship didn\u2019t change because we\u2019re together now, it just got added onto. Everyday we are both learning how to be in a healthy relationship, and I am grateful that we are learning together. I trust you, and I have never trusted someone like this. Because of my severe anxiety and paranoia, I always feel like everyone is out to get me. Like I\u2019m being lied to, or tricked. So it\u2019s always been hard for me to trust people without making sure they aren\u2019t lying. With you it isn\u2019t. I know if you say you are going somewhere, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going, and if you say you\u2019re doing something, that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. I have never felt this attracted to someone in my life. In every way. I\u2019m attracted to your personality, your face, and your body. You are so caring and kind, you have such a big heart. I could stare into your eyes forever, and I would kiss your lips all day if I could. I love your smile, it\u2019s one of the best things I\u2019ve ever seen. You make me look forward to the rest of my life, for the first time ever. I have smiled more since I met you than I have in the entire rest of my life combined. You help me through so much, even if you don\u2019t know it. Just the thought of you makes me feel better when I\u2019m upset. You have no idea how many times I\u2019m in a bad mood and I just turn on my phone and stare at your face on my lock screen. You are the love of my life. And by that I mean you are the biggest reason why I love my life. We can have days where we are intimate and physical, we can go out and walk around town, or we can just cuddle and watch movies. But no matter what we do it always ends with us laughing together. I love us. I love you. More than anything.", "title": "I just wanted to share what my girlfriend will be waking up to tomorrow.

My film premieres on Thanksgiving on Amazon and in select theaters! Hello neighbors! My name is Ricky Borba, and I\u2019m a film director. This Thanksgiving my second film, Hope for the Holidays, will debut on Amazon, iTunes, Google movies, YouTube movies, and iScreening Room. Earlier this year, my first film, My Brothers\u2019 Crossing, was in theaters nationwide right before theaters were shut down. \n\nHere is a link to the trailer: \nhttps://youtu.be/1RrF4R7uJoE\n\nHope For the Holidays is a film I began working on in 2017. It stars Oscar Nominated and Golden Globe winning actors and actresses. The basic story is that a mother, played by Sally Kirkland, finds out she has cancer. Her son, played by George Stults, goes into panic mode and decides to rob a bank to pay for her medical bills. He gets caught, goes to prison, and the rest of the film is a race against time for him to see his mother one last time before she passes away, IF he can get out of prison.\n\nThis is where things get really personal and beautiful for me. Yes, beautiful. Just two months later, that July, my own mother called to tell me she had Stage IV cancer, and she died just 7 weeks after finding out. My mother and I were as close as a son and mother could be, so this was incredibly difficult.\n\nHowever.\n\nWith the permission of the original writer of the script and the producer, I was able to almost completely rewrite the character played by Sally Kirkland, to say in the film, the same exact things my mom told me on her seven-week battle with cancer. Without exception, almost every scene in the film, Sally's character Georgia is saying verbatim, what my mom said in real life. \n\nIt was a truly cathartic and beautiful way for me to honor my mother. To direct a film, my first film at the time, about the story of a mother and son, a mother who has cancer and wants to see her son one more time. I feel truly blessed and thankful that I was able to honor my mother this way, and that is one of the many reasons I can't wait for you to see this film. It's my hope that it encourages and inspires you, and at the same time is a film that you agree is made with excellence.\n\nSo please give it a watch this holiday season and let me know what you think. I'd love to hear your thoughts.", "title": "Hey Redditors!

God bless the good people of Moderna and Pfizer, and everyone else who tried to help.\n\nThe vaccines are not a big on/off switch for the world.

I was in a physically and mentally abusive relationship. One of the most toxic, narcissistic human I\u2019ve ever met. She had a massive coke problem and I also have a 19 month old daughter. She was 10 months at the time. We kept house hopping because all our money went to her habit and diapers. I kept losing jobs over it. She gave my daughter coke at one point and time said it would \u201chelp with the teething\u201d... (looking back now I should have left then and hate myself that I didn\u2019t but that\u2019s a whole other can of worms) anyway I knew I wasn\u2019t happy and knew I deserved better and I finally walked away in March. I had nothing. Me and my daughter were homeless. Staying on friends couches. I had a good friend who helped me get through this toxic mess of my life. He was wonderful and nothing I was used to, because let\u2019s be honest anything was better then what I was just with. So we kinda started talking and I went to see him few times and I came to a realization that he just wasn\u2019t what I wanted as my partner. I\u2019ve worked so hard on myself that I was gunna stand up for what I wanted out of life because I had been pushed around so much in my previous relationship and in life in general, i knew if it wasn\u2019t what I wanted it would just destroy me in the end. So I ended it. So in the mean time in July I moved in with my grandparents to get on my feet. I\u2019ve had a job (the same one) for 6 months, I\u2019ve bought a new car and I know what I want out of life and if you don\u2019t like it you know where the door is. I\u2019ve worked too damn hard to be pushed around again. So a guy I had friendzoned, who I\u2019ve known for over a year has been helping me through everything. Well come to find out he\u2019s everything I\u2019ve been wanting and then more. I\u2019ve been hurt in the past and have lots of guards up but with him it is the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. He\u2019s becoming my best friend and I think I\u2019m starting to fall for him. Like hard. And it\u2019s scary so I\u2019m going slow making super sure it\u2019s what I want for me and my daughter. Also my daughter had the absolute best Christmas. Last year, I was still in the toxic relationship, and she took my money for Christmas and spent it on coke so I had to wrap old toys for my daughter and put them under the tree. The tree was just a string of lights on the wall in the shape of a tree. It was heartbreaking. And now this year she had an actual tree, with actual presents and she was so excited and to see her face and I had a few meltdowns because I can\u2019t believe how far I\u2019ve come. I\u2019m moving back to my hometown in April and I\u2019ll finally be able to have my own place for me and my daughter and I just really wanted to share this because I wanted to feel validated by Reddit \ud83d\ude02 (still something I\u2019m working on daily)", "title": "One of the best years of my life and it\u2019s only gunna get better from here.

Today I was blessed with the opportunity to do so. \n\nAs I said earlier, I'm sad and angry and that was the state of mind I was in when I walked to the store today. In fact, I was extra grumpy because I had already gone to the store earlier and they were out of what I wanted and told me to come back a few hours later, so this was my second trip. \n\nAs I was walking home I noticed a young girl walking a block ahead of me and a man and his toddler behind me. I wasn't really paying much attention, I just wanted to get home and figure out why I wasn't getting sound to one of my ear buds. When I got to my house I saw the girl, who was walking in front of me, sitting on my steps looking dejected. I asked if she was okay and if she was thirsty. She just asked if she could use my phone. I figured she was going to make a call, so I unlocked it and gave it to her. She was actually looking at Google Maps to figure out how far she was from home, and she told me her story.\n\nShe had gotten out of school a few hours earlier and the bus was late. Her dad was supposed to pick her up and he must have been late, so she decided to walk home. She ended up getting lost and had been walking around for three hours trying to get home. I've been there, so I felt so bad for her. From the map I could see it would be another hour of walking to get from my house to hers. So I decided to get her safely on the bus to get home.\n\nI invited her inside because the bus wouldn't be arriving for another 30 minutes. I let my sister know what was going on and grabbed my change bag to get bus fare for her. My sister, offered her to share her dinner with her. She mentioned that she hadn't eaten since lunch at school. I grabbed her a bottle if water and we (my sister and I) ordered her an Uber. The Uber arrived right as she finished eating and I saw her to the car and waved her off. Both my sister and I were in a good mood just from being able to help her.\n\nAn hour later the doorbell rings. She came back with her mom, dad, and brother. They came back to our house to thank us for making sure she got home safely. They had been searching for her and called the police to find her. To say they were relived would be an understatement. That they came all the way back just hits me in my feels. I wasn't looking for thanks or recognition, I just wanted to make sure she made it home. \n\nNow, instead on being sad and angry, I'm feeling happy and squishy.

I am a stickler for the \"classic\" era of puzzle solving/adventure/platforming games where you either solve increasingly difficult puzzles/challenges and/or collect things along the way to open up new areas.    Think along the lines of Crash Bandicoot,  Spyro The Dragon, Jak and Daxter, and Yooka-Laylee!   And then there's the survival horror classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill before they turned into hardcore action games. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love other types of games too, but there's something ultimately satisfying about the replayability of these other types. At least for me! I tend to get bored easily by RPGs where you walk around and go on \"looting\" quests and constantly upgrade your character. \n\nWhat is making this moment so special for me, however, is that it is sparing me the agonizing anxiety and depression I was feeling due to these lockdowns (up in Ontario,  Canada).

I am now 36. For the past 24 years I have done everything I can to prepare for this goal starting from scratch.  It's been a long road with a lot of great experiences, but then end goal has always been the same. \n     \nHere's an overview of the road that has finally lead to my being able to pursue this dream: \n\n- began playing music at age 12 and went on to study bass in college\n- in my early 20s, I got a job at a bank to get a better sense of how funding and costs work\n- in my mid-20s, I created [this children's book and read-a-long video](https://youtu.be/SqvKkwU5uxs). The process of creating this was my way of making sure I had what it takes to see a project through to completion. It ended up getting me addicted to projects\n- in 2013, I left my finance job for good after getting a book deal drawing mazes (Extreme Mazes, Mindware series).\n- I then went on to publish a handful of other maze books as I worked on improving my drawing skills. This also helped me learn how the art/design world works. \n- Also in 2013, I got a lucky break while replying to an online posting. It lead to [this nationally televised set-design/art work](https://youtu.be/M5n0jLf2-Bc). \n- From here I was able to start networking in the Chicago film scene and got a gig as a Stand-in for Chicago PD from Season 2 through Season 5. This helped me really understand what the film production process looks like from the inside. While animation is different in a lot of ways, the overall production process on a tv show set has a lot of overlaps.  \n- After this, I wanted to increase my Project Management skills because I knew that any film project will eventually require me to lead a team. So I combined my design/set-work and creative energies and began looking for a fitting PM job. Unfortunately, I couldn't land a job in my target industry (animation), but I did get work in fast-paced, creative based industries (Trade Show &amp; Experiential Marketing). \n- I was able to PM hundreds of projects over the past 4 years, and it taught me a lot about being able to adjust to problems, working with vendors/contractors, setting workback schedules, managing client expectations, etc...\n- So last year (2020) I finally saved enough money to build a PC that can handle the 2D and 3D softwares I've wanted to learn for years. While I know Adobe pretty well from work throughout the years, I've never gotten to truly dive into Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya, etc...\n\n\nAnd that brings me to today. Earlier this year, I let my current employer know that I planned on leaving in May to begin my animation career in earnest. I've saved up a modest amount of money to hold me over while I dive into learning for 3 months. I've signed up for bootcamps, bought courses, and started testing my skills just to make sure this is what I want to do. \n\nSo... here's why I'm so happy: \n\nI created these two animations on my new gear. These are my first attempts at animating, and I love the process of making them.      \nThere's no doubt in my mind that this is what I want to be doing, and I was encouraged to see the results of my first attempts.     \nThere's a long, long way to go, but my dream can finally begin. \n\n[My first background animation.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11xrTJ7dqXqmYDCoeFy_1vgxPeFJi0fO1/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[My first character animation.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Hk3TEy3NbYS7SwsiRm4bFtdFqDXt1xN/view?usp=sharing)     \n      \nThanks for reading!

Simply by laying on this mat for 20 mins a day, you'll be in a deep state of relaxation, and this really helps to relieve any aches or pain from your neck, shoulder -- all the way to your upper and lower back.\n\nThe second item that really helped me with my condition -- in particular my degenerative disks in the cervical region -- is this neck traction device ([https://the-orthorelief.com/](https://the-orthorelief.com/)) which helps to relief pain by gently stretching your neck and spine.\n\nHopefully this changes someone's life the way it did for mine :') Cheers, and feel free to reach out to me if you need any other tips!", "title": "I'm happy that I found the cure for my back and neck pain.."}, {"created_utc": 1610620023, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kx34ef/i_havent_taking_a_selfie_in_like_forever_because/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I haven\u2019t taking a selfie in like forever because I had a major break up with my ex boyfriend but now I actually found happiness. and self love \u2764\ufe0f and tough I leave this here \ud83d\udc8b"}, {"created_utc": 1610612390, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kx1kux/happy_makar_sankranti_to_my_fellow_indians/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Happy Makar Sankranti to my fellow Indians \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f"}, {"created_utc": 1610612077, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kx1ik9/me_and_my_best_friend_transitioning_and_finding/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Me and my best friend transitioning and finding ourselves together.

During my freshman year of college, I was introduced to a guy who played on the baseball team and I quickly fell in love with him. After three years of dating, he proposed and we wed in a beautiful ceremony at the church both my parents and grandparents had married. We soon welcomed a beautiful baby boy and four years later, another son.\n\nI don\u2019t want to focus extensively on the falling of our marriage, so I\u2019ll try to keep it short and simple. After having our second son, things became tense. My ex no longer seemed to want the responsibility of being a father to our two young boys. He stayed out late after work and would go straight to sleep upon arriving home. For the sake of our two very young children. I stayed in the marriage for as long as I could. I eventually learned that he was having multiple affairs and came to the conclusion that I needed to get out. \n\nI was granted sole custody of our boys and we moved back home to be closer to my parents. Occasionally, my parents would force me to go on social outings with friends for the sake of my own sanity. My hometown friends had made lots of new connections since I had left town, so nearly every outing I was meeting new people and making new friends. \n\nDuring one of our \u2018girls night out\u2019 I was seated next to a very tall woman (I\u2019m 5\u201911 and she dwarfed me) whom I had not met before. We ended up talking nearly the entire night away and I instantly felt a bond between us. I learned that she was the Vice President of a rather large company and that she had worked all the way up from the CEOs personal assistant to his number two executive. I was beyond impressed and became even more intrigued. Subsequently, I learned she was only a year older than me, yet she had never been married and had no children.\n\nWe exchanged phone numbers and promised to keep in touch. I figured that I had just made another friendship, but this one felt different. She was so down to earth and didn\u2019t gossip about others the entire night, which was a breath of fresh air. She seemed like a genuinely good person with a good head on her shoulder and that was exactly the type of person I wanted to befriend during a period where I was already under enough stress. \n\nWe soon started meeting up, just the two of us, and I learned even more about her personal life. She revealed to me that she was gay and had known since she was just eight years old. She had come out of the closet years ago but hadn\u2019t had a serious relationship since high school. A spouse and kids were something she always wanted, but she felt it may never happen. I consoled her and opened up more about my own struggles over the past few years.\n\nWithin just a few months of knowing each other, we became best friends. We did something together nearly every weekend and she would come over to my place after work to play with the kids (who quickly came to adore her) and give me some \u2018rest time\u2019. I somehow didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but she was trying to make the point that she loved my boys and would do anything to be with me and raise them as her own.\n\nIt was during a lunch outing one afternoon that she revealed her feelings towards me. She told me that she didn\u2019t want it to change our relationship, but felt that it needed to be said that romance was on her mind. I told her that I needed to think about it. Quickly, I saw her facial expression go from nervous to sad. I started to think about everything in my head at that moment. Deep down, I had developed feelings for her as well. It was all just so confusing to me. I had never been into another woman like that and besides her, I could not find another woman \u2018attractive\u2019 even if I wanted to. \n\nI thought about all she had done for me and how great she was with my boys. Looking at her sad face, I grabbed her arm and told her that I wanted to be more than friends. Her expression changed to a mixture of shock and delight. I told her to ask me out. She did and we went on our first date the next evening. \n\nThings only got better from that point on. Our friends were shocked but beyond ecstatic for us upon hearing the news. She held my hand everywhere we went and always made it a point to declare that I was her girlfriend. I thought it was the cutest thing that she was obsessed with me. That\u2019s when I realized that we were probably going to get married. I had never had any interest in a woman prior to meeting her and now here I was on the verge of being married to one. \n\nShe proposed on our one year anniversary. We married in the most amazing destination wedding just seven months later. Taking her last name was the honor of my life. I quickly became pregnant and we welcomed our first daughter ten months after the wedding. Since then, we\u2019ve welcomed three more daughters and I have a fifth in my belly as we speak! Three years ago, my wife was promoted to CEO of her company. Despite holding such a powerful position, she always puts plenty of time aside for the kids and myself. I am beyond proud of her and honestly just honored to be able to do life with such an amazing person. \n\nI must say that I don\u2019t even see or think about her gender anymore. It\u2019s all pure love. We are soulmates. It\u2019s a type of love and emotion I never felt with a guy and sure wouldn\u2019t ever feel with any other woman. I love her for her and that\u2019s the most amazing feeling to be in love with someone just purely from the heart. \n\nIt\u2019s probably a bit cheesy, but it\u2019s not everyday someone has a story like mine, so I figured I\u2019d share. I hope this inspired or encouraged at least someone out there! Very few people know of our backstory so it feels good to share it here, even though it\u2019s still somewhat anonymous \ud83d\ude42", "title": "The story of how I fell in love with another woman."}, {"created_utc": 1620930553, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/nbnml3/im_happy_because_i_have_wanting_to_this_for_a/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I'm happy because I have wanting to this for a long time now.

Up to that point, I had been seeing a therapist for things that my previous foster parents did to me and also just working through my anger of losing both of my actual parents, my mom passing when I was 9. When my now adoptive parents first took me in though, I just didn\u2019t trust them. And I hated my adoptive dad simply because I was afraid it would be the same thing all over again. Lots of angry shouting between us and us both saying things to each other we shouldn\u2019t have. It was pretty bad. But, as my therapy went on, I eventually started to open up to them little by little and apologized for a lot of stuff I said and did. Though I actually opened up to my mom more than my dad at first. But, by the time my birthday came around, I could honestly say I was comfortable with being around them and started to see them as my actual parents now.\n\nSo we had a small birthday party for me with only my closest friends and immediate family because of pandemic reasons. After everyone left, I was up in my room and my dad knocked and asked if he could come in. So he sat next to me on my bed and I immediately thought I was in trouble for something, but he reassured me I wasn\u2019t. He asked if I had a nice birthday and even asked how my therapy and life in general was going. This was the first time we really had a talk like this. I told him everything was fine and then, never seeing this emotion on his face before, he got very sorrowful and worried for some reason. I asked what was wrong and then, out of nowhere, he said \u201cWell I really just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry\u201d. I said \u201cSorry about what?\u201d, \u201cWell everything. I got angry at you all the time because I thought you were ungrateful or something like that. But, at some point I just realized you were scared and angry. I don\u2019t blame you. I would have been too. But I just couldn\u2019t see it for some reason. And I\u2019m sorry\u201d.\n\nBy this point, I was at a loss for words and he just kept talking. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to forgive me. But just know that me and your mom care about you so much. Love you like nothing else. I know I do. And I\u2019m sure your parents are proud of you, wherever they are\u201d. He pointed to a framed photo on my nightstand I have of my mom and dad. Normally I would get extremely angry when someone mentioned them. But, in this moment, all I could feel was my eyes well up and my breathing was like I just ran a marathon. I wanted so desperately to just hit or throw something. But instead, he just reached out and put his arm on my shoulder and, out of I guess instinct, I just wrapped my arms around him and started crying very hard. I hadn\u2019t been like this since my mom died.\n\nHe held me tight against him, and all he said was \u201cIt\u2019s okay sweetie I\u2019m here. It\u2019s gonna be okay\u201d. Him saying that only made me hold on to him tighter and cry even harder. But I eventually calmed down and the anger I had finally subsided. But I wasn\u2019t happy or anything like that. Just empty, really. I told him I was fine and we just kind of left it at that, though I did cry myself to sleep that night. The next morning, I talked to him in our kitchen and also apologized for the things I said and did and he moved past it saying it was okay. I hugged him and this time it felt different. Like I genuinely felt safe for the first time in a long time. I didn\u2019t cry again, but I did say \u201cI love you too, by the way\u201d as a response to him saying it to me the night before and we both smiled.\n\nFrom then on, things got better between us and now I honestly feel myself being closer to him more than my adoptive mom. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love them both. It\u2019s just something about his personality and character that I find similarities of my own with and makes me that much closer to him. He\u2019s the first person I go to for most of my issues actually. He\u2019s a good dad and a good person. I can\u2019t imagine where I\u2019d be without him or my mom.", "title": "The first real heart to heart I ever had with my adoptive dad"}, {"created_utc": 1620866492, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/nb444x/eid_mubarak_may_we_get_to_see_many_more_happily/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Eid Mubarak!

I have good relationships with my mom and brother, and my brother is probably the coolest kid on the planet. My friends are finally fully vaccinated which means I can spend time with them soon! I also have a house full of plants that I care for, and an old professor is letting me and another classmate garden at her house. \n\nI had a really rough childhood and have struggled with depression, anxiety, ocd, and ptsd for years. I still struggle with mental illness and neurodivergence, but when I sit down now and think about where I am I can confidently tell myself that I don\u2019t need to be as sad and afraid as I was when I was a kid. I have proof that my dad and stepmother were full of shit when they told me every way I would fail. I did all of this myself\u2014I bought everything big that I own. I pay my own bills. I put myself through school. I. Did. This. And now I am surrounded by people who I love and love me, and I am safe and full of blessings and gifts. \n\nI just feel like I have so much to look forward to. Plans for cookouts, hiking, camping, fishing, gardening and making fresh food that I grew, making art, movie nights, bowling, and so on. I get to create things for people I love and feed them good food. I have the time and space to appreciate the beauty around me. I know that I will still have sad times in the future, and I am okay with that because sadness isn\u2019t the default anymore. \n\nThanks for reading if you did. I could say so much more but this post is pretty long now. I hope everyone has an awesome day and that good things come to you too.", "title": "Proud of myself and happy about finally being in a better place"}, {"created_utc": 1620823814, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/nanw6q/urgent_request_thank_you_in_advance/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!

The stress of being in a bad mood and the frustration for not being able to snap out of it is something we all have felt.\n\nHere are some practices I follow to try and get rid of my bad mood:\n\n1. Shift my perspective\n\nWhen I\u2019m in a bad mood, I\u2019m most likely to see things and situations negatively. To make myself feel better, I focus on shifting my perspective from a pessimist to an optimist. When I look at the brighter side of everything, I understand that I have so many reasons to be happy about it. Even the fact that I\u2019m alive and breathing every day is a reason to be happy.\n\n2. Taking a break\n\nWhenever I find myself in a bad mood I make sure to give myself a break from whatever that I'm currently doing. I make sure I do something relaxing which lets me unwind. It is essential to take time for yourself to keep your mood in check.\n\n3. Eating my comfort food\n\nEat is always the best stress buster for me. I always make surer to eat my favourite ice cream when I'm in a rut. It\u2019s these small self-care practices that help me look at the brighter side.\n\n4. Talking about my issue\n\nWhenever I\u2019m in a lousy mood I make sure to share my feelings with a loved one. Sharing what\u2019s making me upset, brings another and often positive outlook to the situation.\n\n5. Rewarding myself\n\nYou are your most significant support. Whenever I\u2019m feeling down I make sure to reward myself. Doing things that make me happy. Gifting myself things that I want. Doing things like this reminds me that it\u2019s just a phase and I will be over it in no time.\n\nIt\u2019s imperative to do things that make you feel better when you feel low. Everyone has different ways to deal with their bad mood. The main thing to focus on is self-care. Treating yourself once in a while a taking time to relax and unwind.\n\nHere is the reference article:\n\n[**8 Ways To Get Rid Of Your Bad Mood - LiveLife**Get rid of your bad mood with these simple methods.

I myself am an experienced ranch hand, having been around livestock almost my whole life and even having to work as a hand at a pretty dark time in my life. Dark because me and my wife had to take some time apart from each other after the passing of our daughter. She moved out and lived with her parents and I lost the apartment we had, so I got a job working as a hand through a mutual friend of ours. Pay was okay and was enough to save up with since I just lived on the property anyway. I at least got along with most of the guys I worked with and am still friends with some of them. And the silver lining in all of this is our foster daughter, who we are extremely close to adopting.\n\nShe'd always talked about wanting to just be on a horse after seeing pictures of me when I was younger and me telling her about my ranch hand days. So I called one of my old work friends who now has his own property and we set a date for us to come out. And I remember how quickly her excitement and hope faded when she saw just how huge some of them were in person, many of them easily over 6 feet tall and even taller on their hind legs. But thankfully we got a beautiful bay (brown body, black mane) mare for her.\n\nI went over the basics before I even let her get on, showing her patting to keep the horse calm and get her used to your touch, the parts of the saddle and how to put one on, putting on a bridle (thing that goes on the horses head/face that includes the headstall and bit that goes into their mouth, including the reins you hold onto as you ride), how to lead them, etc. I spent about an hour doing this and I could tell she was getting more and more hesitant about getting up on her. So to help show her proper technique, and to show it wasn't that scary, I got a stallion and showed her the proper way to mount and even brought her up with me and had her take the reins and helped her steer. We just kept it at a gentle walking speed and her whole demeanor changed immediately. \n\nAfter she felt calm enough, we went back to the mare and she nailed the mount on her second try. \"Holy shit I did it! I fucking did it!\". We kept it slow and I rode next to her around the perimeter of the ranch to be out of everyone's way and she was loving every second of it. Once we got back near the stables, I showed her how to go just a bit faster and do a trot, which again she did flawlessly. I don't know how many different ways I said \"You're a natural!\". The amount of joy on her face was indescribable. \n\nSo that was pretty much it. She got to meet the other hands who worked there and I almost had to drag her back to the truck when we went home lol. I gotta say I did miss being out in that environment and being in such a free and open space as opposed to our suburbia we now live in. But I had a reason for leaving, which was to be back with my wife again. We wouldn't have had our precious angel we have now otherwise. And as of yesterday, we are on the final step to finally adopting her.

It's been six months since we took in our girl and almost from the outset, we had every intention of fully adopting her. Sure me and her had our differences, mainly because of me and bottling up my emotions over a tragedy we suffered years prior, but I've started seeing her as my daughter now and we're closer than ever. During this time, we've had visits from our agency that come and conduct wellness checks on both the living conditions of the house and also to see how we're doing, especially her. And every time it's gone smoothly and perfectly, at least for their requirements.\n\nSo we had another visit from them today and this was what we anticipated most. It was just more paperwork to be submitted to the court as well as an official Petition to Adoption that we needed to finally complete. While me and my wife were doing this though, one of the other agents sat with our daughter privately to just talk and ask how things were going, if she genuinely wanted to stay with us, anything bad that was happening that we weren't telling them, etc. And at the end, they brought her back in and said that now, all that's left is for them to submit everything to the court for a judge to review. They said that hopefully we should expect a response within 30 days but oftentimes it's sooner depending on how clean the background check is and a few other things. \"We're almost there\" she (our agent) said.\n\nIt's funny because our daughter, while she was extremely happy with how everything was going, wasn't nearly as filled with joy as me and my wife were. My wife was actually crying and couldn't contain herself. She nearly smothered her in her arms giving her a bear hug. I hugged her too and just looked her dead in the eyes and said \"We're almost there baby girl\" before kissing her forehead.\n\nI mean I just don't know what to say or how to say it at this point. This is like a dream come true with everything we've lost but also have gained so much more in the process. It breaks my heart thinking about how many other kids her age or around it (she's 14) are out there but will never have a permanent home like she will. But, I try not to think about it and am just thankful we have a kid as perfect as her in our lives.", "title": "As of an hour ago, me and my wife are on our final step to fully adopting our kid.

I had a moment with her a few weeks ago where most of my emotional walls and barriers came down when, after we'd had an argument the day before, she told me how scared she was that we were going to give her away to someone else. Her fear is what made me get over the grief and baggage I was carrying and I finally told her \"I'm not gonna let you go\", and we hugged for the first time ever.\n\nSince then, things have been going great with the three of us and we told her about our plans to adopt her in the near future, once the state does what they need to on their end. Needless to say she was over the moon and legit did not believe us at first. I myself didn't cry that night, but I was close. But yesterday, while my wife was out and it was just the two of us again, I decided to sit down and talk to her about my family, what it was like growing up for me, all that stuff. Just because she was soon going to officially become part of the family. And the first question I asked her was \"What's my name?\", \"Adrian?\" she replied, which is right. And Russian. She was absolutely blown away hearing me say my first, middle and last name like I did with my accent and it was honestly adorable seeing her face light up.\n\nSo let me offer some clarification and insight: I myself was born and raised in America, but my grandpa was from a place called Vladivostok and came to America with his family when he was 12. He would eventually meet the amazing woman who would become my grandmother and they got married at 25 and had their first kid, my dad, soon after. Then came my aunt and uncles later. And then my mom and dad meet and date all through high school and I pop into existence when they're 24. And that's basically my lineage in a very big nutshell. She\u2019s already met my siblings, so she knew to a degree what my heritage and background was like. But I remember how diligent she looked just sitting there taking it all in like I was revealing the meaning of life or something to her.\n\nSo I go on to explain how me and my wife met and got to this point in our lives. And then the barrage of questions came and each one seemed more personal and deep than the last. Though a lot of it was her asking how you say X in Russian and me laughing at her trying to replicate it and then her getting mad at me laughing. I think she just liked hearing me speak it, even though my accent isn't nearly as strong as my dad's or grandpa's obviously.\n\nThis went on for about an hour or so and I even showed her some family photos of people she's never met or who have passed, like my parents and grandparents. But then I switched gears and took a big risk by just asking about her family and at least what she knows about them, reminding her \"We don't have to talk about if you don't want to\". There really wasn't much to say since her grandparents passed when she was little and her parents were basically monsters to her, which lead to her being put in foster care in the first place. So I didn't pry any further. Didn't want to make her upset. But she was good and I told her how much I love her and how much she means to me to comfort her. I even called her malyshka, Russian for baby-girl. And also Solnechnyy svet, which means sunshine or sunlight.\n\nAnd that was about it. There was a lot more personal stuff we got into about my family and other things that, for the sake of brevity and privacy, I left out of this post. But overall, I\u2019m glad we talked and she was too. I don\u2019t really talk about my family much but figured she deserved to know as much as possible before officially becoming part of it. And I think she\u2019s slowly starting to become more attached to me. She usually calls for me first when she needs something, sits next to me on the couch more, comes to me first when she wants to talk about whatever, etc. I\u2019m not sure what could have triggered it but hey, I\u2019ll take it.

Where do I even start? Disclaimer : it's a long post!!\n\nI'm from a remote town in India with a dream to pursue my Masters is the US. It wasn't an easy path as my parents wanted me to stay back and take a job that I'd gotten and support the family. Instead I fought with them and took a student loan and assured them that they don't have to spend a single dime towards my education and finally they agreed. (They weren't hesitant about me getting higher education, we are from a caste that is known to do business and they expected me to take over my dad's business which I never saw myself doing for the rest of my life.)\nLife wasn't easy here at all. Though I had an undergrad degree in electronics and communication, my life long desire to become a doctor (could never become a reality because I've been diagnosed with blood injury phobia) made me pursue a degree in bioengineering (I envisioned building a medical device that could save people's lives). It wasn't easy as I had no proper background in biology except for what I learnt in high school. But I never gave up, I kept myself going and soon realized that it's very hard to get a job in bioengineering without a PhD or being a non-US citizen. I switched to doing a minor in a more computational field and ended up taking Machine learning and tried to work as a research assistant in labs at the intersection of ML and healthcare. All my batchmates were graduating and I was still struggling to find an internship. Finally I found one and I had to extend my school by a quarter to do the internship. I got very good exposure and hands on experience during my internship and then back to square one - searching for a FT job. My resume would not even get past the resume screening software that's used by companies because I was applying to a ML job with a Bioengineering major when people in CS couldn't crack it. Finally, got a job as a data scientist in a financial organization. They put me through 11 rounds of rigorous interview hoping I would fail but I nailed all of them and my manager thinks I'm an asset to the team. It took me 9 months to clear off my student loan and I couldn't be proud of myself!!!\n\nAll I want to say is NEVER SAY NEVER!! Keep hustling and your hard work is paid off in one form or the other. :)\n\nTL;DR - Fought with my parents to come pursue masters in bioengineering, realized the job market is really dry, did a minor in machine learning, beat the odds of getting a job with a Bioengineering major and clearing off the student loans within 9 months.", "title": "I'm finally soooo happy to clear off my student loan!

But my gut feeling said to me I should still give out my address and see what happens (oh boy my mom would sure like this lol). He even asked if I wanted more stuff to get shipped besides the Cheez-Its and I told him to send over some Twinkies, Mac 'n Cheese, Ritz, some Chex and a few Butterfingers. While he did say I could add more stuff to the package, I didn't knew anything else so I told him the rest can be a surprise because I find those to be exiting.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago and I get buzzed by the mailman.

During my freshman year of college, I was introduced to a guy who played on the baseball team and I quickly fell in love with him. After three years of dating, he proposed and we wed in a beautiful ceremony at the church both my parents and grandparents had married. We soon welcomed a beautiful baby boy and four years later, another son.\n\nI don\u2019t want to focus extensively on the falling of our marriage, so I\u2019ll try to keep it short and simple. After having our second son, things became tense. My ex no longer seemed to want the responsibility of being a father to our two young boys. He stayed out late after work and would go straight to sleep upon arriving home. For the sake of our two very young children. I stayed in the marriage for as long as I could. I eventually learned that he was having multiple affairs and came to the conclusion that I needed to get out. \n\nI was granted sole custody of our boys and we moved back home to be closer to my parents. Occasionally, my parents would force me to go on social outings with friends for the sake of my own sanity. My hometown friends had made lots of new connections since I had left town, so nearly every outing I was meeting new people and making new friends. \n\nDuring one of our \u2018girls night out\u2019 I was seated next to a very tall woman whom I had not met before. We ended up talking nearly the entire night away and I instantly felt a bond between us. I learned that she was the Vice President of a rather large company and that she had worked all the way up from the CEOs personal assistant to his number two executive. I was beyond impressed and became even more intrigued. Subsequently, I learned she was only a year older than me, yet she had never been married and had no children.\n\nWe exchanged phone numbers and promised to keep in touch. I figured that I had just made another friendship, but this one felt different. She was so down to earth and didn\u2019t gossip about others the entire night, which was a breath of fresh air. She seemed like a genuinely good person with a good head on her shoulder and that was exactly the type of person I wanted to befriend during a period where I was already under enough stress. \n\nWe soon started meeting up, just the two of us, and I learned even more about her personal life. She revealed to me that she was gay and had known since she was just eight years old. She had come out of the closet years ago but hadn\u2019t had a serious relationship since high school. A spouse and kids were something she always wanted, but she felt it may never happen. I consoled her and opened up more about my own struggles over the past few years.\n\nWithin just a few months of knowing each other, we became best friends. We did something together nearly every weekend and she would come over to my place after work to play with the kids (who quickly came to adore her) and give me some \u2018rest time\u2019. I somehow didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but she was trying to make the point that she loved my boys and would do anything to be with me and raise them as her own.\n\nIt was during a lunch outing one afternoon that she revealed her feelings towards me. She told me that she didn\u2019t want it to change our relationship, but felt that it needed to be said that romance was on her mind. I told her that I needed to think about it. Quickly, I saw her facial expression go from nervous to sad. I started to think about everything in my head at that moment. Deep down, I had developed feelings for her as well. It was all just so confusing to me. I had never been into another woman like that and besides her, I could not find another woman \u2018attractive\u2019 even if I wanted to. \n\nI thought about all she had done for me and how great she was with my boys. Looking at her sad face, I grabbed her arm and told her that I wanted to be more than friends. Her expression changed to a mixture of shock and delight. I told her to ask me out. She did and we went on our first date the next evening. \n\nThings only got better from that point on. Our friends were shocked but beyond ecstatic for us upon hearing the news. She held my hand everywhere we went and always made it a point to declare that I was her girlfriend. I thought it was the cutest thing that she was obsessed with me. That\u2019s when I realized that we were probably going to get married. I had never had any interest in a woman prior to meeting her and now here I was on the verge of being married to one. \n\nShe proposed on our one year anniversary. We married in the most amazing destination wedding just seven months later. I quickly became pregnant and we welcomed our first daughter ten months after the wedding. Since then, we\u2019ve welcomed three more daughters and I have a fifth in my belly as we speak! Three years ago, my wife was promoted to CEO of her company. Despite holding such a powerful position, she always puts plenty of time aside for the kids and myself. I am beyond proud of her and honestly just honored to be able to do life with such an amazing person. \n\nI must say that I don\u2019t even see or think about her gender anymore. It\u2019s all pure love. We are soulmates. It\u2019s a type of love and emotion I never felt with a guy and sure wouldn\u2019t ever feel with any other woman. I love her for her and that\u2019s the most amazing feeling to be in love with someone just purely from the heart!", "title": "The story of how I fell in love with another woman."}, {"created_utc": 1624071283, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/o36k2l/wholesome_discord_invite/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "title": "wholesome discord invite"}, {"created_utc": 1624069356, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/o361zq/i_just_published_my_second_book_last_month_a/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 3, "selftext": "[deleted]", "title": "I just published my second book last month.
