It was lame and I stumbled upon a room that sounded empty. When I went in, there was one girl sitting in there sipping wine and listening to music. You guessed it: queen bee. We made eye contact and recognized each other immediately. She let out a nervous \u201chi\u201d and me having drunkness that was ever so slightly creeping up on me, I plopped down on the other end of the couch and let out an annoyed \u201chey\u201d. Out of no where, she let out an \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about how I treated you in high school. About all of it.\u201d At that point I was more than tipsy and tried to keep it together so I told her that I\u2019m past it and got over it. She then apologized again and brought up specific events that I, too, remembered. I could tell that she really beat herself up over it, and I her eyes we starting get teary, *and* I was drunk and hungry, so invited her to walk with me to a restaurant right off campus. \n\nIt was one of those 24-hour diner style spots so we ended up sobering up and talking till about 3am. I found out that she had just transferred there from her previous school. And that freshman year, her mother passed. She said everyone kept telling her that her mother would be so proud of her, and she thought back to how she treated me, and how she knew that it was cruel and that her mother would be horrified. I, again, told her it was over with and that I actually was having a great time that night. I walked her to her dorm and since it across campus from mine and she lived in a single room, she invited me to stay in with her. Things happened, and I got her number. \n\nAfter a month, I asked her to be my girlfriend, and after we graduated and lived together for a couple years, we got married. Now, at the age of 40, we have 3 children and I couldn\u2019t be more in love. \n\nSide note: both of our group of friends were in absolute horror and when they found out we were dying. My friends kept trying to remind me of high school, but they softened up to her when they realized she\u2019d changed. And my wife invited some of her high school friends to the wedding.

Also sorry if it's quite long.\n\nSo during my life I've always had this question: what exactly js love?  I've asked this often and all the response i got was it's a feeling you get when you find someone for you. So through my life, I've been a lot of relationship seeking this feeling and seeking a better answer to my question, basically seeking to learn to love someone. Yet, despise feeling passional feelings and cared, I knew somewhere I didnt experienced love yet.\n\nIn college, I took an English class that focused on the subject of love. It was very enlightening as I found the first hints to what is love. Firstly, i learned that what I experienced was not love but rather the feeling that comes when cathecting.\u00a0(\"to invest with mental or emotional energy\", https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cathect )\nVery curious about this subject I read \"The road less travelled\" and it was approached as codependent relationship. I then realized that despite all my attempts i had never new love in a romantic setting but rather only in friendships.\n\nThen I was presented with the first definition of love that made sense to me. Its a definition first written by Scott Peck in \"the road less travelled\" and was rearranged by bell hooks in \"all about love\":\n\n\" [Love is] the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth [...] Love is as love does. Love is an act of will--namely, both an intention and an action. Will also implies choice. We do not have to love. We choose to love.\"\n\nThis was like an awakening for me. I had found my first rules for my new love ethic. And so when it came to it after 2 years of being single I made a new boyfriend and I tried to apply this philosophy as hard as I could. I thought if I decided to love him then it would be love since i made the choice to love and did many actions of love. Yet, thus didn't work as after a bit more than a year I broke up as I realized that I was forcing myself to love him but also he did not have any love ethic and would cathect with me instead of loving me.\n\nI know there are many underlying reason for breaking up. Yet, this really sparked a debate inside me as wether you can really decide to love someone.\n\nIn the case of arrange marriages, people learn to love their new partner. It was explained to me that in some other culture happiness is not as individualistic than in america as many times happiness comes more from what we do for others rather than what we do for ourself. Thus, forcing yourself to love your partner in an arranged marriage is normal and is done mostly happily since it brings joys to the family. \n\nYet, my own experience contradict what I've been thaught on that and wondered what was your experience or theory you may have from that. Can you learn to love someone?\n\nAlso, I have came to be able to \"love\" friends that on first hand I didn't like and ended uppractice a good love ethics naturally with them.  Shouldn't it be the same when applied to romantic relationship?\n\nOn my end, I have since then manage to find my special someone and did not have to force myself. We both naturally simply applied the definition of love as we really care for each other and really want to do things for each other. Since I plan on staying with that person for the rest of my life, i cannot test my hypothesis hence why im asking this today.", "title": "What is love?

First of all I hope everyone is safe and healthy with your families. I'll separate this message in backstory and present in order to get and the best tips/advice as posible. Please read everything, I know it's a bit long but I would appreciate it so much, thanks! :)\n\n**Backstory:**\n\nFirst of all, both of us are 18, go to the same school for like 13 years now (It's not like in the US that you need to move from schools for middleschool, highschool etc) and we are both **shy**. Since kids, I've noticed this girl has liked me and me too, since the first day I saw her, but both of us were just too shy to act, years passed, until we were like 15-16 when the things got more notorious (mainly due to puberty and sex drive). She started showing interest, she never directly approached me to talk, neither did I. She gave little **shy sign**s such:\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eAct extroverted or playful when I passed next to her (her friends giggling and all of that stuff)\n\u25aa\ufe0eWhen I had class with her, she A) surrounded me singing and all of that but never actually talk to me or B) Ask random and obvious questions to my desk buddy but never directly to me\n\u25aa\ufe0e She even wrote on a note \"i love you\" and passed the notr to her friend (I was next to her friend) to give it to me, again, I failed to act properly and with interest and act as it I didn't saw the note.\n\nUntil one day I decided to text her, I replied to one of her Instagram stories with a \"\ud83d\udc4d\" at which she replied with a heart, again, I failed to compose and sent her a heart with \"What does that heart mean?\" She left me on read, it was way to direct and freaked her out. That was like 1-2 years ago, I'll fast foward to now, that I'm 18 and in the last year of highschool.\n\n**Present:**\n\nOne of my goals for this year is to push me myself in the social side of things and try to speak more and spean more to girls, so like a month-ish ago I decided to text her again, where I sent her normal messages, not dry at all and asking questions, you guys know the drill. Her responses were great, with emojis, not one word texts or dry as it'skknown commonly. I asked her if she wanted to go for a run after quarantine and that we should talk in school (when this pandemic ends, if it ends...) she agreed enthuastically. We keep texting about music, workouts (both of us are sporty) and some small talk. But, (there is always a but) since I texted her, I was concerned about a few little things. Them being:\n\n\u25aa\ufe0e She never actually asked me questions back, she replied with emojis, laughing, in general, very good responses. \n\u25aa\ufe0e Never initiated conversation without me starting it\n\nWe could argue that she didn't do that because she is shy, or a bad texter overall, so I had mixed feelings and confused, because on one side she acts very good, and agree on gling for a run, but on the other hand she replied hours or sometimes a whole day late but she always replies good, but again, never initiated. So as you can see, I am confused, so I decided to text her this \"I wish you were more into texting cause I like chatting with you\" I know this can be a little passive aggresive especially with a shy girl, she didn't replied, it's been 6 days and nothing, I still think that it was a bad text to send and that there is still some fire going on, I don't really want to move on yet, I've liked her for years. So I decided to write here in order to get the best advice, should I text her again? With a meme? Question? Song recomendation? Or should I actually move on and seek tl talk with her in person on school  (at this pace is rare to happen due to coronavirus)\n\nI would appreciate you guys to actually help me chose the best decision, please take the time to read the whole message, I know it's long but I would appreciate it a lot, help me out!\n\nHave a nice day, stay safe everyone. :)", "title": "Help me out with tips guys, what should I do?"}, {"created_utc": 1591114701, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gvaajl/i_couldnt_have_asked_for_a_better_bf/", "num_comments": 17, "score": 2, "selftext": "So I identify as pansexual.

Maybe a bit too attached. I've recently come to the conclusion that I might be Aromantic, considering I've never really had a crush on someone unless it was completely sexual. Despite me being a very sexual person, I have never once thought about her in that way. Nor do I want to go on dates and kiss her (granted, i don't want to do that with anyone) but she's a case I've been struggling to figure out for awhile now.

When she talks about her other close friends I get jealous, and when she told me about a friend that recently confessed to her and she didn't know how to feel about it. I was supportive to her face, but immediately started crying afterwards. I seceretly wanted to hunt him down and tell him to fuck off, but I would never actually do that. I don't necessarily want to date her (we couldn't anyway, considering shes straight and I'm a bisexual woman myself), but I don't want want anyone else really dating her either. If I'm on equal footing with someone else in her life, I feel the overwhelming urge to crush that other person down until I'm at the #1 spot again. Anytime she puts me above others, or just states that I am her best friend I feel an overwhelming sense of pride. It's probably super unhealthy, I know, but no matter how hard I try to supress those feelings they just get stronger and stronger. Anyway, I know this is long.

My whole life, for some reason I chose the in the minute, action-packed live for the moment lifestyle. The only things I ever loved besides my family and close friends, was drugs, fighting, partying and basically illegal shit. I really only love myself and it showed through my self-centered greed and hypocritical views.\n  For the longest time, all I ever wanted was to find my true love, but my lifestyle and selfish ways never let that happen. I'm 32 years old, from Brampton Ontario, and 8 out of 10 of my childhood friends are dead and gone. All my people are doing Penitentiary time, dead, or now full-blown drug addicts. There was nothing to love for the longest time. Everything around me was fake, evil, or tainted in some way.\n  About halfway through March of this year, something happened to me. It's like I woke up from a long coma. The feeling came over me like a warm blanket. In a way I felt my inflated ego starting to Decay and crumble. I told myself that love is everywhere around me and I'm not going to ignore it anymore. From that day, I started changing my life around. I started accepting. I started forgiving. The flow of positive energy that started coming through me was like the most potent drug I've ever done. My face muscles would hurt everyday from how much I would be smiling. I stopped playing on my ball hockey team ,and  I started donating my time at the local food bank. It makes me feel good about myself. I LOVE the fact that I didn't waste another day trying to love myself, when I could have put all that energy into my aura and the people around me.\n This new type of Lifestyle is like a positive magnet, and it's pulling every little bit of positive metal fragment in closer towards myself. I've actually been going out on dates with the types of women that I used to long for. I can hold my head high, with pride and people can see my confidence now. Love and everything to do with it has changed my life. Not love for one specific thing, but love for many different things. I love the new opportunities I have, I love The New social groups I Frolic with. I love my mental state and my positive outlook. I love the fact that the simple free Pleasures in life make me smile now.\n  I'm smiling as I write this. I'm looking at my scars and wounds from my old life as they have Scar Tissued up my body.

I've only ever been on one date, who eventually bummed money off me.  When I've ever had feelings for a girl, I would never know how to react.  For a while I tried my best to ignore it.  I just didn't want to feel that way, whatever I was feeling.  Sometimes I think about all those girls who I had \"crushes\" on and it feels so weird.  It was so long ago, and I feel nothing when I think about them.  The only thing I feel is embarrassment about how I would act.  Weather it would be me being awkward or a dick, I remember how it felt not to understand the things in my head and how to deal with them.  When I told her how I felt, she said she needed to focus on herself. She has a lot of problems she needs to work through, and I want to be there for her, even just as a friend.  I understand and respect her decision, but even then it's not like I can just switch off my feelings.  I still want to be friends and try to give her space, but when I am alone, I can't h3lp but think about her. I often have a problem with trying to differentiate my daydreams from reality.  When I imagine being with her, the feeling is amazing.  But I need to keep it in my head.  I need to realize that reality is not that.  I've never known how to internalize my feelings, so often wonder if what I am feeling is love.  Is it possible that what I am feeling isn't love but just rose tinted nonsense.  To go further into this, is it possible that I enjoy the feeling because of the fact that I don't \"love\" myself.  I hate myself and feel like nothing.  I don't know what I want to do with my life.  I hate the fact that I'm a flake and can't commit to a path.  That I run when things get hard because it's easier than trying and failing.

She was walking with a loud dog, half haskey half labrador, that as she often puts it \"has a lot to say\". Brother and I had decided to do sport and were on the grass working out abs dripped in sweat laying on a beach towel.\n\nShe stared at us and I, discretely, noticed it even though I was not really actually looking at her. She sat on a colorful tissue with indian-style animal drawings, the dog next to her, about 20 steps behind us. As we were finishing the workout, while stretching, I just went to speak to her straight. \n\nThe dog scolded at me as if I was getting too close to his nanny. She laughed at the dog and told I got close to abruptly. We spoke about abs and sport. Then she told she was an acroyoga teacher and school owner, but COVID broke the business. \n\nThat afternoon we did some acroyoga after the stretching and I stayed with her. Next day at 6am we met for a morning bath. She was even more prettier in swimsuit. But her real beauty came from the softness and lovingness of her intentional sounds and gestures. She was at peace with life even though she had recently finished a relationship of 4 years. \n\nThat morning, comong back home she noticed she forgot her indian style pareo on the sea rocks. I went back to the place footing and washed it for her. She used understand me instantly and be honest with me. She showed braveness while speaking because she was shameless like a child but conscious and respectful. I could feel she had recently conquered a part of her self that made her look smart and attractive in my eyes. \n\nNow it's been weeks I've been seeing her. It started as a unbelievable recurrent utopic fantasy in my mind. She was 32 and I 25. Last week, at the beach, we kissed each other for a second. And I just want to say I was a procrastinator guy who used to smoke and somehow be very ambitious (or egocentered) because I didn't like my life at some point and then wanted to change it with money. \n\nIn one week she touched something inside me that now makes me want to live with her. I want to work in time and give the most to live with her. I need to TRY. Otherwise I'm going back to my maniac-depressive kind of pattern of reading state-of-the-art tech-onomics and smoking pot to waste time.\n\nNow I'll keep working for a while and go turn my world upside down during the acroyoga practice.

We would talk for hours on end and once we were together physically- there was instant electricity. There was such a connection between us, that even now I struggle to explain. As the years went on, we dated, but ultimately always wound up in relationships with other people. He would later tell me that he was afraid and intimidated by what we had, and was too immature to truly commit to it. Whenever we were single again, we would be right back in each others arms- the electricity and connection never faded not even slightly. \n\nA few years ago we both wound up engaged and subsequently married (to other people), both of our marriages began to decline for different reasons and we began having an affair- this carried on for over a year. I ended up divorcing my now ex husband, but the one remained married despite his unhappiness- too afraid to divorce for fear of his family being disappointed in him. I should add that oddly enough, we married these two partners on the exact same day. \n\nOnce my divorce was finalized, I was offered a position with my employer out of state and I relocated halfway across the country- and away from the one. I was heartbroken, not so much over my failed marriage (my ex husband was emotionally/verbally abusive and at times physically threatening as well) so I was relieved to be out of that situation- but heartbroken because I was now so far away from the one, and I couldn't kill my desire to be with him. \n\nMe and the one still talk, he is still married and incredibly unhappy/unable to bring himself to leave. We confess our love for each other, and that same deep connection to each other is right where it's always been. I have always, and will likely always believe we were actually meant to be together- but in some odd cruel twist of fate never will be. What do you do? How do you let someone go after a saga that has gone on for 15 years? I don't know, and I'm not sure I even want to. My heart truly wants, and needs him- even from many many states apart. I dream of him, I laugh with him, I think fondly back on our times together, and I crave him with every ounce of my being. As we have aged (me now in my late 30's and him in his early 40's) the connection has deepened even further. \n\nIf my honesty about the affair has triggered anyone in this chat then I am sorry, I'm not proud of it- but it did occur and I do not intend to shy away from the truth.

Each foster home I was in was just straight abusive in almost every sense of the word,thus being in and out of homes for a good portion of it. All I wanted was to have a good family and home and being able to grow up and live like everyone else while secretly hoping my siblings and mom and I would be back together someday.\nMy favorite movie as a kid was  Sony's Spider-Man starring Tobey Maguire as the web slinger we all love. I remember the first time I saw it on DVD there was one thing that stuck with me for years,and that was the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, specifically the one scene where they're outside at night talking about their futures and all after high school. Right after I saw that scene I was in awe and thought to myself, \"I gotta find me my Mary Jane\".\n\nThe first girl I fell for was in middle school,a girl a grade above me named Senaida who also had the same homeroom as me. Like Peter and Mary Jane,we were good friends and would talk and hang around school whenever we weren't busy with work. I wanted to ask her out several times throughout our time there,but never could as she always had a boyfriend at the time. By the time she was single she was in high school already,though would quickly get a boyfriend soon enough who was an 8th grader in our school.\nShe's now married to a different guy with a kid as well. Crazy \nEvery other year in between after it'd be more of the same with other women,8 more to be accurate,with the last being with a former friend of mine named Nicole.\nBasically I fell for and was toyed by 9 women. Now I'm at the age of 24,and have come to the conclusion that I don't want to be in a relationship,married,or have kids(that last one was something I've known for years tbh,which I've heard from several is a major \"deal breaker\" with women).\nBut maybe I'm just going about it wrong or something,idk.\nI am more into Canadian and Aussie women now,as well as females that are like Lexy Panterra and Selena Gomez as far as looks and personality goes,so maybe that has something to do with it.\nHence why I'm asking for feedback on this forum,really.\n\nAnyways,sorry this is so long,and I can get some answers.\nThanks!\nWill", "title": "Wondering if I'm wrong bout giving up on love"}, {"created_utc": 1597779308, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ic7z13/shes_in_my_head_all_the_time/", "num_comments": 13, "score": 1, "selftext": "Here I am trying to go to class, study, and sleep and her face just keeps popping up in my mind.

I wanted to get to know her more but before I knew it she got pregnant from a guy she was speaking to before speaking to me. I hate her for that but I love that she was honest with me, But i left her. 2 Months later she came back crying and wiling saying that she never k=thought that she would allow someone to affect her like that and that she wants me in her life even as just friends forever. I really hesitated initially because I felt betrayed and apparently she stopped talking to him. So things are dandy and we are a little bit closer and it feels amazing. But then her sister comes into the equation. Weirdest thing is I met her sister a year before even speaking with the girl I love. Basically her sister was into shit and it ended up with my love being evicted from her house cause of an argument. so as time is going she became homeless again prior she was homeless sleeping in her car before. One day she asked me if I would be able to take her and her sister in and tbh i live with my mom and my mom never allowed females to stay in my house especially with me so I declined. However my biggest thing is if you truly loved me we would communicate on how to make her circumstance better. Long story short her sister is intertwined with evil shit and tied my lover in it. The reason why my lover is saying fuck it is because she wants to make sure her sister is ok. But what ends up happening is my lover is on some other shit and starts getting abused from where she was staying without telling me. And what hurt me the most is during this whole time she 1.Had sex with the guy \"on xanz,alcohol,and weed\" and prior she was getting ready to leave to see me. I hated her but still had love for her because I know that she's in a circumstance and I want to take her out of that and be with me as my baby to eventual wife. However during this whole time this was the 3rd strike. When she became homeless she wanted to move with her dad in another state and was doing everything she can before she even leaves such as: hanging with family, friends, me but apparently the person she was staying with wasn't letting her leave.

It's meant to be read at leisure. If this post is well received, I may write more! This is my first post to this subreddit, so please let me know if I am breaking any rules!*\n\n\\-- ENTRY 1 --\n\nEveryone I once loved continues to follow me like ghosts.\n\nThese ghosts aren\u2019t vengeful or cruel, but rather hang over me like heavy clouds, blocking the sun and making way for rain. But the weight of the sky is familiar, and the cold is almost comforting, in that I have felt it for so long. It\u2019s unchanging; reliable and steady. Steady until the clouds fall, as clouds do, and the cycle continues.\n\nNone of my past lovers are deceased. They\u2019re all alive and well, as far as I am aware. Though, I am not really aware of how they are at all. I became detached completely from most of them, for one reason or another. They share in common the fact that I too desperately resisted the resting period one must allow to come to pass after separation. Even if I agreed to separate, I was never ready for my heart to release its iron grip over the emotions I had felt when I was with them. I grieved them like one might grieve the dead. I grieved not the person, but everything they stood for. Everything I stood with them for. Everything they now are that I will never be a part of again.\n\nSometimes I muse that I am still in love with them all. Once my fearful heart was opened, the previously plugged, rusted, and clogged faucet of love and passion, things I had trapped deep within, began to flow. The faucet poured and poured, and no matter how tightly the knob was twisted, love of some form found its way out in a steady drip.\n\nThere is no concrete age that a person arrives at that entitles them to the knowledge and understanding of \u201clove.\u201d Some never come to understand it. Others learn very early on, for one reason or another. I was one such child. Being a child, I had an innocent crush on a boy who was loud, messy, free and sharp. He was everything I envisioned a perfect child might be. I, too, wanted to be loud and free and sharper than steel. So I went after him, and he obliged.\n\nI didn\u2019t love him, then. Not when we first met. I was excited, being in a new place around new people. I\u2019d known him for maybe a few weeks. We were, say, twelve or thirteen back then. I was still young-minded and poorly socialized; the kind of child birthed from private academies and the sheltered upperclass suburbia. Wealthier and more groomed than most of the kids there, but all too unaware of it. So my sentences came out crooked and my words too big, but this made me interesting, so I managed. Bless the determination of a child, for between my romantic pursuits I spent my time breaking down in bathroom stalls. Alas, that\u2019s not the focus here.\n\nI don\u2019t know when it began, really. I don\u2019t think he ever loved me in a way that could be meaningful. If he did, I failed to hold onto it properly. All I know is that it happened quickly and mercilessly. His hair was too long for boys his age and had the volume of a freshly blow-dried puppy, and I *adored* it. I was not so reckless in my youth as I am today, else I would have smothered him and his soft sandy hair with feeble kisses and gentle fingers. I say this wistfully, but I doubt he would have allowed such a thing to occur. Instead I breathed in the smell, which I still remember- maple syrup, the kind that is sweet, sticky, and light- and held his head against mine, irresponsibly committing him to memory, wholly and completely. \n\nI was so innocent back then. So innocent that I couldn\u2019t properly form the word \u201ckiss\u201d on my lips without turning red as a rose and clapping my hands over my face to soften the blush of my cheeks. He teased me for that. It happened easily, and I remember it well. I replayed the moment over and over that night, and for the following few days. I never wanted to forget it, and I never did.\n\nWe were sprawled on a couch watching a documentary, which may have been odd for kids our age, but you were an aspiring astrophysicist and I was determined to become a computer technician, so it wasn\u2019t unusual for either of us to find the lull of space documentaries fascinating and comforting. I placed a kiss upon your cheek, and you placed one near my eye. Like a game of tag, we traded soft pecks with the kind of shyness only children bear. You shifted your weight in a way I didn\u2019t expect when it was my turn, and I accidentally kissed the edge of your mouth. In response, you took me and kissed me, there and then. My very first kiss.\n\nDo you remember when I told you that I loved you to the moon and back?\n\nDo you remember telling me, in reply, that you loved me to the outskirts of our galaxy, the Andromeda, and back?\n\nOh, how the stars in your eyes shone back then. It was so beautiful. I only wished that mine were half as glittering.\n\nSuch a terrible thing that happened to us. Perhaps I could have loved you forever. But time passed and you changed. Youth is such a turbulent time, after all. I stagnated. Your unbridled frustration, sourced from impatience, became acutely evident, and suddenly the thorns of the rose-colored glasses I wore began to dig into my skull. Once it hurt too much to bear, I panicked. You were tired. I was insensitive, poor with communication, needy and uncertain. I was unaware of how much I had come to love you, and unaware of the need to control such a feeling, let alone how to. And, above all else, we were only children.\n\nHowever, I did not deserve your dismissive eyes and negligence. You should have told me then that I was not wanted. But perhaps you didn\u2019t know how to deal with me, unfiltered and unconfined as I was. The only lapse in my memory is that of your cruelty. My heart wants to love you so badly, it would forgive your every wrongdoing to do so. Such a function is not unique to you. It plagues every boy I\u2019ve ever loved. I believe it may serve as a failsafe, to ensure I will always try again. But the ache remains, and the residue of tears and blood and spit sticks forever to my skin. No, you never hurt me in a way that could be seen- only felt.\n\nYou held our relationship over my head for four years. I begged, pleaded, apologized and reached out to you more than I should have. I wanted answers, comfort, understanding and, more than anything, love. On the fifth year, we stopped speaking to each other completely. I did not speak of you. You did not speak of me. Our friends become your friends, and I adapted. I understood that I did not exist to you. I was not part of your world.\n\nYour words burned into me. \u201cYou make everyone sad. You carry your sadness with you like balloons, and then you go and give everyone your sadness balloons. You\u2019re too sad.\u201d\n\nAh, but perhaps what hurt more were the words that said, \u201cI have made myself forget everything about you.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about you now. You are your own man, an adult navigating the world as one must do. You went off into sports medicine at a good college, and I entered an elite conservatory to study music and production. \n\nStill, my heart remembers you as a child; a young boy with long, goofy hair and a big grin\u2026\n\n\u2026and the coldest eyes I\u2019ve ever known.", "title": "A little miniseries I'm thinking of doing?

No big deal right, just finally won\u2019t be lying about your age on r/teenagers and RA I\u2019m really glad things didn\u2019t turn out the way we thought they were going to after making that post on RA. I think that was July 17th, if memory serves (um and it usually does). I can\u2019t believe that was only a month ago. Wow. I remember I was very conflicted, thinking about how it would be easier to not be together and to just bury my feelings. But I knew I would have a difficult time doing that because that\u2019s not the type of person I am. I wish I could be with you right now. I so would\u2019ve snuck out to hang out with you tonight if you were here. I tell you a lot more now, but I want to use my words for good, not to hurt you, like they used to. Here are some things I really like.\n\nHere is something I wrote the day after we hung out for the first time, (just so you know that I\u2019ve always felt for you):\n\n**5/23/20**\n\n**Liam was right when he said he only wanted to make me happier. I really am happy right now, despite all of the fighting in our family. It\u2019s like my own little secret, a piece of happiness that I can escape to. My dad can take away all of my technology but not the afternoon I spent with Liam yesterday.** **Hopefully there will be more like it. He\u2019s really such a good guy, I can\u2019t believe I had my doubts about him before. As Liam would say, \u201cno matter\u201d or \u201call good\u201d. He says those two phrases a lot, which is kinda funny.**\n\nHere\u2019s something I wrote after we broke up, just to remind you how far we\u2019ve come:\n\n**6/8/20**\n\n**L,** \n\n**I enjoyed it while it lasted. It was nice hanging out with you, and your friends too. They were nice to me. You were nice to me, too. I really did like you, but I know in my heart that it wasn\u2019t working out and putting it off any longer was just fucked up. A word of adv!ce, don\u2019t tell someone that your relationship is serious after 4 weeks, especially if it\u2019s their first. I appreciate all of the conversations and afternoons we had together. I appreciate you for putting up with me.**\n\n**Bye,** \n\n**F**\n\nHere\u2019s my posts:\n\n**For you, because I know you check my account from time to time.**\n\n**Thank you for trying. Really trying to fix me. I don't accept people deep into my life very often, but you were patient and gave me time to gradually let you in.**\n\n**Things weren't always good, in fact, for the first 2/3, they could get pretty messy. But you stuck through it. Positive affirmation, right? That's what I hear they tell people to do to support one another.**\n\n**I've never been big on it. Words are so overrated. I've never been a good talker, though somehow after those first ten minutes we hung out, everything felt easy. To be honest, compliments are useless when you overuse them. Dating someone with low self esteem is like that, I guess. No matter who tells me, or how many times, I still have that little voice in my head.**\n\n**\"They're lying.\"**\n\n**Unfortunately, the people who hurt me still have a place in my mind. My mind sometimes tells me that they were the only ones who could see me like I see myself. I don't see myself in a very great light sometimes.**\n\n**You are so full of love. Despite all the stupid decisions you make, you have a good heart. I can't wait to see who will be the receiver of that affection. You deserve someone that is good like that.**\n\n**You did nothing wrong. You love physical and verbal affection. Positive affirmation. Me? I hate it. You tried to teach me love but that's not how it works sometimes. Especially in such a short time.**\n\n**With love,**\n\n**FS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To you, because I hope you see this.**\n\n**It was a simple afternoon. The branches defending us from the harsh gaze of the sun. A hint of a breeze would play at my hair. Though I had put it back, stray pieces worked their way out from its grip and brushed your skin. Trying. Teasing.**\n\n**I ignored the pull in my stomach. As hungry as I was, your touch was all I needed, safely exploring the boundaries of my body. Just a slight touch, on a simple afternoon. Your fingers would brush my cheek, down to the skin between my jaw and my neck. Tracing the lines of my face. Your lips on mine.**\n\n**I wish I had counted all the words we had said to one another. Over text? On the phone? In person. Phone calls hours long into the night. The faint remnants of rain glittering on the street under a light post. I should've been home but I wanted to talk to you. I wish I had a number. A number to summarize all the breath I spent on you.**\n\n**Ever since March, I don't think a single day has gone by that you didn't dance through my mind. Not just fleeting. Every day was organized around you. That should be some what reassuring to you. You told me you thought about me a lot. Though I'm not good with words, I should've told you the same.**\n\n**Feelings are only a reaction. How can I be mad at you for the way you felt? And mad at myself for not feeling the same. I shouldn't be, but I am. Things should be different. Things will never be the same as they were.**\n\n**I can't stop feeling that this will be easy for you. I remember everything. You once joked about how insanely detailed my memory was. You? Not so much. I know you won't remember the things we talked about in the hallway after class. You probably don't remember the things I said on our first date, because I said a lot. I remember exactly the things you told me, and the things you lied about, though they were few. You won't remember what you said to me when I did a shit recording of you guys playing in the basement in December 2017. I remember all of it. That's the unfortunate part.**\n\n**All of these memories that I have the burden of remembering and carrying with me. It's the feelings that will get to you. But its the memories that will get to me. The memories will pop into my head just when I'm over you. They will curse me for ruining a connection so beautiful.**\n\n**I will no longer feel like a burden. The way you listen and the way you care, it will make someone very happy some day. As strange as it sounds, I can't tell you. I don't want to tell anyone what goes on in my head. It's too dark, too sad, sometimes. I want to keep it in. If you don't know about it, it doesn't exist.**\n\n**Most of all, it scares me to imagine what you must think of me... now. I asked you the night before I ended it what you thought of me, and in your drunkenness you told me. You told me how you really felt and your words were beautiful, though I am not one for verbal affection.** \n\n**Your feelings were beautiful and positive and loving and I knew that it would be selfish to have you if I didn't feel the same. I know you were confused the next day when I ended things because I broke my silence to ask you that, and I'm sure you hoped that I was going to act like myself again. No.**\n\n**I just had to know what you thought of me then. Because now I will never know.**\n\n**I truly am sorry.**\n\nAnyways, enough of that. I love you a lot. And you\u2019re the best thing to happen to me in this past year. It\u2019s nice to finally feel like someone needs me as much as I need them. I suspect that at the beginning of our relationship I continued cutting things off because I was afraid that eventually I would need you as much as you needed me. I enjoyed that for once, someone was hopelessly chasing after me, not the other way around. But it wasn\u2019t hopeless after all. \n\nOmg I feel like I\u2019m writing wedding vows. No thanks. Haha no marriage for me. At least not until 37 and a half- jk unless?\n\nHere is my favorite memories:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The first time we hung out because, well, I knew after that day that I wanted to give it a chance. Sometimes I craft a relationship in my head based only off of online interactions, and I was afraid I\u2019d done the same with you. I\u2019m glad it applied to real life too. In that day, I was so happy.\n* Laying on your chest that one day in June. I don\u2019t remember exact details (for once) but I remember later that night you were like JUST KISS ME YOU LAID ON MY ENTIRE BODY TODAY. haha. I most definitely did, and enjoyed it too.\n* When we hung up the hammock under the whole fucking shelter in case it rained. It was nice to cuddle even with people nearby. It was kinda wack, but comfy.\n* The day after my manic episode where we crossed the creek and I took off my top (haha). I couldn\u2019t even talk right after that omg. Also the view was amazing.\n* Laying at the top of the slide before I went to \\~charlotte's\\~  house. That was so nice I felt so safe :). The weather was great too, perfect day to be held.\n* Waking up hella early and ditching my dad to hang out and try oui'd with you. &lt;3 thank you for getting up that early for me and being so sweet to me that day.\n\nI love you infinitely.\n\nI wish you were here. &lt;3 sorry abt no birthday head &lt;3", "title": "TO MY LOVE ON YOUR BIRTHDAY"}, {"created_utc": 1597721804, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ibtjo4/i_am_sooo_confused/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 0, "selftext": "I had crush on this girl for almost 2 years and me and her chatted for a while (about 3 weeks) ,we had all those long-ass convos.

I fell in love with her pretty fast. I knew I loved her after only 1 month, but I didn\u2019t tell her yet. We are in college, and we started dating a few weeks before winter break. Well, I was super excited to see her after break, so I planned and executed an over the top return for her (I planned out a few cute small inside joke gifts and hand made her a stuffed animal of her favorite animal). She really seemed to like it, and I really enjoyed doing it. This was around when I knew I loved her. We went on a trip together with a bunch of friends, and it went well but she said she wasn\u2019t ready for something serious. Fast forward about a week and change, and I got drunk and told her I love her. She didn\u2019t say it back but she did kiss me. The next night I said it again (when we were both sober) and the response wasn\u2019t as good. She basically told me she\u2019s not ready for that yet. I told her the second time for 2 reasons: the first is that i already said it when I was drunk and I wanted to see her sober response, and the second was because i felt like it\u2019s something she should know. She wanted something casual and that\u2019s a pretty big secret to try to keep from her. Anyways, after that she got weird and distant. She wouldn\u2019t really talk to me too much and she didn\u2019t cuddle or kiss too much when we were together. Stuff kept coming up and we went a few weeks like that. We finally got to talk, and I basically said that just because I fell in love doesn\u2019t change the fact that we aren\u2019t a serious, long term relationship. I said I was just planning to enjoy it while it lasted and I figured we would stop dating at the end of the semester. After that conversation, she got a lot better almost instantly, and we were good for a little bit. Then covid happened and ended our semester early, and she barely even hung out with me on the last night. I didn\u2019t get a proper goodbye or anything. I wrote up a long love note to say goodbye. In it, I basically told her that I really enjoyed our time together and I\u2019m going to miss her and I wish we had more time. I\u2019ll admit I probably shouldn\u2019t have left it, but I felt like I had nothing to lose since the relationship was over anyway. Well, we talked once in a while after that. I started most conversations, but she started some. All of a sudden, she stopped. She unfollowed me on Instagram, and she didn\u2019t reply to texts (I didn\u2019t spam her, I only reached out twice in the week and got ignored both times). I took the hint and stopped reaching out. After a month and change I decided to try again and sent a snapchat to her and a bunch of other people. She opened it and I got no response. Then a few weeks later I sent something to a few people on my birthday, and once again she opened it and didn\u2019t respond. Now we are back at school and have classes together. Today was the first day of classes, and I was filled with dread at the thought of having to see her. After class, I texted her a question (one of our classes is online and the feed cut out a bit). I got a one word response then it was back to silence. I hate that I haven\u2019t gotten over her, and I hate that I drove her away like I did.

I had lots of ideas, spanning from music to politics. However, there was something else that was at the forefront of my mind. \n\nA month or two before, I was broken up with. This was a breakup that was pretty out of the blue. It was also with someone I didn't think I'd get hurt by, since I've always played it pretty safe. After one bad experience, I learned to guard myself pretty heavily. This time, however, my guard was down. He was the first person I never got an \"ick\" for. This was actually really new to me. I had a pattern of quickly losing interest for those who approached me romantically. I wish I could tell you what was different about him, but I don't even know myself. \n\nThe breakup was hard on me. A pain that I never really felt before, which was crazy since we'd only been a thing for around 5 months. I spent the whole relationship denying what he meant to me, but I truly learned once it was over. \n\nI spent a while blaming myself. I nit picked every action I did, criticized my appearance, and beat myself up. I made sure I knew that it was my fault, and mine alone for the split. I made new friends, and made sure I spent as much time as I could with them, for each moment I had alone felt dark. I started running, stopped eating. A couple weeks of that and I thought I was making real progress moving on from this person. And just like that, I was sent home from university to be alone with my thoughts.\n\nLike any conflicted teenage girl, I used my 30 thousand words to write about love. I wrote about the way we talk about love in literature. How its unforgiving. You \"fall\" in love. You don't walk into it. We write and talk about love as if its uncontrollable. I wanted to know if that was really true. I interviewed two people about their own love stories, and I learned about what goes on in the brain when one falls in love. Turns out, it kind of is uncontrollable. At least, thats what the neuroscientists I studied would say. \n\nAfter finishing this paper, I now had more time to be consumed in my thoughts. The ones that were full of criticism and sadness. Surprisingly though, things began to change for the better.\n\nI reconnected with an old friend, and she was my beacon of light. She was patient with me, listened to all my rants. She stayed with me when home life became rough. Like me, she'd gone through her own journey of love and heartbreak. With her support, I began to talk to myself differently. The nit picking and harshness died down. The time I spent alone wasnt scary anymore. It was constructive. I realized that I wasn't imperfect, broken, or anything else. Her positivity rubbed off on me like glue, and thus began the story of the love of my life.\n\nIt's my favorite one, thus far.\n\nI realized that I'd forgotten to maintain a specific relationship with someone over the years. I'd been mean, volatile, and downwright cruel. I ignored the good and focused on all the bad. Nothing was good enough for me. Maybe it's because I didn't really know what good enough even was. It's weird, since I used to be so nice. I used to cherish and uplift this relationship. I used to think that this person was unique and special and important. I lost it somewhere along the way. \n\nThis person (you guessed it) was myself. I had forgotten how to love myself. I only remembered how to resent everything and be frustrated with my reality. It was unfair of me to ever expect anyone to love me when I didn't even appreciate the things about me worth loving. How could I ever expect anyone to know my worth, if I took it for granted? \n\nI think my greatest lesson was forgiveness. I forgave myself for the mistreatment. I forgave others. I let myself feel honestly and openly. Slowly but surely, I began to like who I was again. I can't exactly pinpoint when the switch happened. In all honestly, my love still ebbs and flows. However, I know that the way I look at myself is completely different. Its crazy to me just how differently I feel. I'm happy? Im in love? And its because of myself. This time, I didn't need to rely on anyone to make me feel less lonely. To make me feel content or valuable. I just know. Its so freeing. \n\nBeing in a relationship with someone isn't what makes me valuable anymore. I think it'll be wonderful to get a secondary love story with someone else by my side. I hope that whoever it may be will love themselves the way I will. I know that I am in such a healthier space to be able to give love. To myself, my friends, family, and any other special person in my life. I hope that everyone on this planet sees their value and doesn't conflate it with the attention of others. Its hard as hell. I know. It took me around 19 years to learn, and I am still learning. \n\nI dunno. Life just feels nice.

My relationship has been far from perfect however it is really amazing to me to have found the one. The one I\u2019m going to spend a massive chunk of my life with(Hopefully forever). My girlfriend is the perfect girlfriend, sure we both fight and argue and are insecure about our own things, we both know exactly how to annoy the other one very quickly, we both love each other so much. However that feeling, that inescapable feeling of knowing that she is the one is always there. She is an absolutely phenomenal human being, smart, funny, quick witted, drop dead gorgeous, she still gives me butterflies when she kisses me. I have been through some really shitty past relationships and here I am with this girl who feels like a gift from god(if an omnipotent power as such does indeed exist). I\u2019ve never truly been pushed to find ways to support and push another person to be better until\nI met her. We met on a dating app, which even now surprises me. I think the craziest part of it all is that we\u2019re coming up on dating for 6 months and my feelings have truly already developed to the depth of knowing that she is the one. In a way it\u2019s scary, being SO SURE and SO POSITIVE that she is the one, it\u2019s a very foreign feeling. I had given my heart fully to one other, and she took her own life around this time about 3 years ago.

Even when I\u2019m not with her, I think about her. Her smile, her laugh, her big green eyes, the way she smells, how soft her skin feels underneath my hands. It is possible I\u2019m obsessed with her and I\u2019m perfectly okay with that. I\u2019d take a bullet for this girl.

At which point the next question is: Whats the difference between a fool and stupid?  And how low does one have to be to be considered a stupid fool?\n\nI have come to the unfortunate understanding that in the context of and with regard to \u201cher\u201d...I am, at bare minimum, foolish.  An to be honest with you I am mostly \u201cok\u201d with it.

And I meant it both times.  But the reality is I can\u2019t.  I can\u2019t because at the heart of it...I believed what she told me.  And that feeling wasn\u2019t a mistake. It was real.  You can\u2019t make this up.  You can\u2019t fake that.  \n\nSo...now what?  What do I do?  That\u2019s the hardest part.  I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m looking for her to tell me she doesn\u2019t want me anymore.  If I know that then I KNOW I\u2019m making a fool of myself at which point my ego can step in and save what\u2019s left of itself.  But I get a feeling like maybe...MAYBE...there is a chance.

We have been together for years, live together, and run a business together. \n\nSince the New Year began, things have been HECTIC to say the least. My parents health is failing so a lot of my time has been dedicated to caring for them and keeping my family afloat. I own an italian restaurant and in December my girlfriend quit her job to manage and run the restaurant with me and we are opening another restaurant in the fall which is also taking all of our time and energy. We work 12+ hours a day and when we\u2019re not working, we\u2019re struggling to get things done like housework, laundry, feeding ourselves, making room to get enough sleep, etc etc. Now with all this crazy stuff going on our business is heading into a very scary direction (we live in America and are fucking terrified of the future of our country/income/all the employees under us). We are still open for dine-in and to-go but don\u2019t think we will last until the end of the week. At the end of January an unexpected tornado destroyed our apartment and all of our belongings which we are still recouping from mentally and financially. \n\nTo keep it simple, life has been violently busy lately. With everything going on, sex has been at the very bottom of our list. We are just exhausted. Neither of us have carved out the time to care for each other in that way. It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t want to have sex with each other, it\u2019s just been impossible to make a priority. \n\nEither way, i\u2019ve still been wanting her in that way *so* bad. I\u2019ve missed her so much that I hadn\u2019t even realized how much it\u2019s affected me. Last night we were up late with all our anxieties about work and family and smoked a bowl in bed to try to relax. She starting dozing off snuggled into me and i couldn\u2019t help but pull her closer and closer into me. Before i knew it, we were having sex. She was more beautiful than i ever could\u2019ve imagined. She felt *so fucking good* against me. She came for me quicker than she ever has and it immediately reassured me that yes she still loves me, YES she still wants me like that and needs me like that. I can\u2019t get over how incredible and intimate it was being with her after such a long time... like it was my first time touching her ever. I needed that experience SO bad. A huge weight i didn\u2019t even know i was carrying felt like it was lifted off of me when were done. \n\nAnyway, a small silver-lining in the Shit Storm we\u2019re all experiencing right now. I love my girlfriend so much and i\u2019m so so so thankful for the strong bond we have. \n\nIf you\u2019re going through hell in this wild mess of a world right now and you have a girl or if you have a man, hold them a little closer and give them all your love because at the end of the day it\u2019s the most valuable thing there is.

Think about this. Human behaviour. There are good people and bad people. Good loving parents and bad abusive parents. Good bosses and bad bosses. Good drivers and bad drivers. Criminals. Bad people. When they get caught, it's easy for us to say, \"You should have known better!\" Don't you think if they had known better, they would not have committed that crime, that theft, that assault, that murder? But they didn't. That's why the crime was committed. Their brain lacked the necessary reasoning and rational and logical thinking to prevent them from being a criminal.\n\nWhat does this analogy have anything to do with love? Simple. Many people have no clue what love is. They don't. They don't know it when they see it, experience it, and they are not capable of reciprocating the love they receive.\n\nSure, we have the \"5 Love Languages\", but that's still assuming the person understands what love is. For those that don't get it, what they seek or experience is simple companionship. That too can be a strong bond. Two people who get along, do things together, have sex, bicker and fight, go on trips, cook meals, have parties and go camping or watch that ball game. \n\nCompanions. Sometimes this can last decades. But there is no love.\n\nThe difference between these people and those who get the meaning of love is simple. We experience the pain of losing someone we loved. They don't.\n\nThey are the ones who, when YOU suffer a loss, lecture you, scold you, ridicule you with,\n\n* Oh, get over it!\n\n* Stop pining after them.\n\n* Just scratch your ass and move on.\n\n* Plenty of others, get back out there.\n\n* Best way to get over someone is to get under someone else.\n\n* Are you still crying over them? What's wrong with you?\n\n* Sick of hearing you talk about them.\n\n* Why aren't you out there dating?\n\nLots more stupid meaningless statements from people who have no idea what love really is. It's just not in them. They treat the loss of a partner no different than a pair of shoes with a broken heel or a toaster that's stopped working. Throw it away and go get another one, a replacement, and continue as if nothing happened.\n\nI know many people like this. They are also in long term relationships, and that's fine. \"Companion\" is who they are and what they have. They don't/won't get too sad or upset when their partner is gone. They quickly move on to someone else, within days or months, and resume their lives without any memory or longing for the one gone. They are the ones who, when dating, don't want to hear about your past whatsoever, because they won't talk about theirs. For them, it's like those old VCR's. Power failure and the clock flashes 12:00. They are the ones who find it easy to cheat, easy to condemn, easy to criticize everything you say and do. \n\nBut those that truly understand love...it's standing by the door waiting for them to arrive and having dinner or breakfast ready. It's reaching over and pulling them close to you while taking a deep breath of contentment. It's lightly touching them as you walk by. It's buying them little trinkets and gifts because it makes you happy. It's being the first to say \"I Love You\" with meaning. It\u2019s making their pain your own and doing what you can to ease theirs, instead of mocking or ridiculing them. If you love someone, you don\u2019t kick them when they\u2019re down.\n\nIf you're the one who says \"I Love You Too\" more than \"I Love You\", you may be one of the ones who doesn't understand what love is.\n\nLove is telling your partner you love them, and giving reasons why. It\u2019s trying  your best to ensure they are happy and taken care of. It\u2019s doing your best not to get them upset. It\u2019s seeing, then understanding the world through their eyes and showing compassion and understanding. It's holding then slowly kissing their hand or finger while watching a movie or while driving. It's not being selfish while letting them do all the work. It's kissing slowly and passionately. It's caressing their body before and after sex without talking. It's pacing and worrying if they are late on a snowy day. Otherwise, \u201cI Love You\u201d is just empty rhetoric.\n\nLove is feeling the ache in your chest when you lose them. It's crying tears because you know they will never come back. It's keeping the pictures and songs and gifts. because it all has meaning. If you lost someone and deleted all memory of them, you had a companion, not love.\n\nThis is where all this leads to. The worst mismatch in the world is someone who understands love for what it is, being with someone who is satisfied with a companion. An imbalance is created. We give our love freely, and expect it in return. A companion is incapable of showing love at the level we expect. When the relationship ends, the companion will replace their partner in a fraction of the time compared to the one who lost the one they love. \n\nI'm not knocking down books like the 5 Love Languages:\n\n* Words of Affirmation\n\n* Acts of Service\n\n* Receiving Gifts\n\n* Quality Time\n\n* Physical Touch\n\nBut imagine being with someone who does none of the above, or at least, at an extreme minimum, and only when pressed or questioned.\n\nMy last relationship received all 5 of the above from me. Yet in her words, it meant nothing to her. I took her overseas twice in 2018 and never got a thank you. Yet she hosted a Halloween party at her apartment and didn't invite me. After she came to my place, I'd get a hug from her with \"Oooooh, I missed you\", but that was it for the weekend. All the other acts of affection, the random \u201cI Love You\u201d, the snuggles, the kissing, the making love, I would initiate. Bed time was almost always the same for her, brush teeth, climb into bed and roll over. For two years, I would have to roll towards her and ask for / remind her for a good night kiss. She spent 3 -5 days a week at my house. Aside from doing dishes, didn't do much else. I still had to make the rounds picking up all her empty pop cans and cups and clothes and hair in the sink and counter. Wine was always in the fridge. She would bring wine, drink it, then start on mine. Rarely did she bring me something, something she saw at the store and thought, \"He likes these, I'll pick up two for him\". Rarely did she tell me to sit, while she cooked something for me. TV watching was like sitting next to a stranger at the theater, unless I pulled her close to me.\n\nI did all those things because I did love her for all the good that made her who she was. I thought, blindly, that she loved me back the same.\n\nShe would have been better off with a companion, as she had no clue that all my efforts were to show her how much I did love her and what she meant to me. I did 99 things right, 90 more than most men, and she used a trivial incident against me over and over. In her world, couples do not bicker, ever. She is right about everything all the time, and that\u2019s that. She never knew how good she had it until it wasn\u2019t there anymore. She would constantly interrupt me, talk over me, bash everything I said, mock every opinion I held, criticized every action in my life.\n\nShe never loved me.\n\nI dated other ladies after her. To me, they were dead zombies, going through the motions. Their kisses were mechanical, sex lacking any passion. Today, those ladies are with a companion and couldn't be happier. They'll sit around a bonfire and make mindless small talk about neighbours and coworkers and politicians. And that\u2019s awesome too. They found each other. Companions. But trust me, if one bails, they\u2019d be back on a dating site within days. They do not grieve the one they lost. \n\nIf you read this and don't understand the context, the deeper meaning, what you experience as \"love\" may be simple companionship. It doesn't mean it's wrong. It's just not love.\n\nI\u2019m sure there will be lots of \u201chate mail\u201d by those who don\u2019t truly understand what it is I\u2019m trying to say. Aside from the usual trolls who simply hate and want to see the world burn, I\u2019d love to hear from others who understand the meaning of love at the level I\u2019m talking about.

Also a quick breakdown of male vs female dynamics for a lot of dudes that are unaware of their mistakes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know we all want that other person in our lives, that other half that completes us, makes us feel whole and loved and special and gives all these warm fuzzy feelings inside - but **Self-Love is one of the most important loves there is. How can you expect someone else to love you if you do not love yourself?** In our society today, dating and relationships have been completely diminished to something they never originally were. Porn, Social Media, Hollywood movies, Dating apps, and artificial environments have severely messed with our collective idea of what exactly love is and what a relationship should be. As such a lot of us have this longing for \"the one\" or this perfect partner that just makes everything in our life better once they show up - and often the fixation on this idea of \"the one\" drains us spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and sometimes even physically. \n\n\"Lovesick\" is an actual problem that people can have if they don't love THEMSELVES enough. One can become lovesick with the idea of a person in their head and neglect themselves as a result. A lot of dudes can probably attest to this fact - they see a hot girl, she gives them the most basic attention like a smile or a few seconds of eye contact, and then this dude starts basing the entire purpose of his existence around how he is going to get this girl. Obsessively thinking about her all day, trying to figure out \"W*hy doesn't she love me? What am I doing wrong?\",* neglecting their own mental health, derailing from their own life goals, putting the girl on a pedestal \"maybe if I treat her like she's special THEN she'll like me!\", and just becoming generally obsessed and not focusing on themselves. All because a girl gave you a cute smile and some eye contact. **Like come on bro, do you think the girl would do the same thing? The answer is NO she has her own life to worry about. You are not her purpose for existing. Don't make her yours.**\n\nIn today's society - with the school system and most workplace environments isolating you - it can be hard to love yourself and remember that YOU are the most important person in YOUR life. You cannot neglect yourself for someone else's sake. This is not what love is. Love is not putting people on a pedestal, giving them special treatment, being \"nice\" in hopes of impressing someone, trying to be someones else's \"everything\", and basing your entire existence around someone else's happiness. This is a surefire way to create toxicity not only in the relationship, but in your own life as well.\n\nEveryone needs to remember that your first and most important relationship you will ever have is with your own self - because this relationship lasts from the day you are born to the day you die. A lot of people forget that we are all immortal spiritual souls of infinite love and abundance having a temporary human experience. This physical world is not the only world there is. If nothing is impossible, then why would a physical material world be the **only** world in all of the **infinite cosmos?** We are not our bodies, nor are we even the minds that run our bodies - we are the souls inside the body  (the heart if you will) that uses the mind to experience life through the body. You may think of the soul as the player, the mind as the controller, the body as the avatar, and life as the video game. Don't delevel yourself because you think someone else's **avatar** is better than yours. Love your own avatar and make it the best version of itself you possibly can before you go looking for someone else. If anyone has ever played skyrim, I am sure you don't go running around looking for a wife at level 1 or 2 or 3. Most of us are often level 40+ before we think about using that hearthfire DLC. Treat life the same way! Work on your own self and **love yourself** before looking for love from someone else. What you will often find is that *if you love yourself more than you love anyone and everyone else, you will attract love into your life naturally and you won't even have to look for it. IT will find YOU.*\n\nIf you don't know **how** to love yourself, message me or start a chat with me and I will happily tell you :) \n\nThere is no shame in this -  **A LOT** of people in today's society literally have no idea how to love themselves because our collective consciousness has regressed that much over the last couple decades. Blame the corporations that treat us like slaves, the governments that treat us like shit, the porn and dating apps that reduces **human beings** to objects on a screen, and the media for convincing us that *literal bullshit* is how a normal society is supposed to work. We are all here to live our own versions of our own best lives. Don't let imaginary concepts of institutions like school, jobs, government, media, or anything else distract you from the magical spiritual nature of life!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone wants to understand more about the spiritual nature of existence - feel free to message me!\n\nThe world is only 30% physical. Science itself says 70% of the universe is dark matter (mental) and dark energy (spiritual). There is a reason science cannot measure more than 1/3 of the cosmos because only 1/3 of the cosmos is physical. Just because something is not physical - does not mean it doesn't exist. Emotions are not physical and yet they exist. The mind is not physical and yet it exists. Ideas are not physical and yet they exist. Imagination is not physical and yet it exists. Energy is not physical and yet it exists. **Love is not physical and yet it exists.** Thoughts are not physical and yet they exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"***The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence\" -*** **Nikola Tesla**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the Coronavirus pandemic spreading across the globe, now is a better time than ever to return to our spiritual roots as it will help remove a lot of fear from one's life. Nothing is permanent!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For all guys out there that have no game, pay attention - here is a little knowledge bomb:** \n\nNews flash: females don't like \"nice guys\". Don't be a \"nice guy\" because you won't get the girl. This is not to say \"don't be nice\", I am simply saying **don't be a \"nice guy\".** Understand the difference. Females want a **MAN** that makes them **FEEL** in a way that they don't **normally feel. It intrigues them. There is a difference between a \"Nice guy\", and a \"Good Man\" that is kindhearted.**\n\nLook at it from their perspective: \n\nNice guy that acts nice and treats her like a princess because he clearly likes her and wants to get to know her better as long as she understands that he is a nice guy with good intentions\n\n**VS**\n\nMasculine Man that does not give a flying fuck about literally anything at all - not even her - other than his own life, his own goals, his own mission, his own dreams, his own desires, **HIS OWN SELF**.\n\nBoth are kind and respectful, both make the female feel a certain way. \n\nThe \"nice guy\" makes her feel like she is in charge of his entire life (I am your slave is what is sub-communicated)  as he constantly seeks validation (also known as a beta or a boy) and the Man makes her feel like a normal person that is not on a pedestal and - if anything - she has to prove herself to him if she wants his attention.\n\n**To put it simply:** \n\nNice guy = beta boy that desperately needs validation and gives her all his attention. \"I'm nice why doesn't she like me? Why does she like him? He doesn't even pay attention to her! She's probably just a slut anyways (trademark beta boy band-aid phrase to avoid dealing with and accepting rejection), she doesn't know what she's missing, oh if only she knew she'd be sorry and beg me to come back\". An insecure beta male that cannot take no for an answer and has no ambition or drive.\n\nMan = Alpha male that does not give a literal flying fuck about anything he is not **already doing.** A man on a mission, a man with goals, a man with ambition, a man with drive, a man with passion, a man with purpose, a man with limited attention to spend on a girl that he doesn't even know personally as his life is already full of value. Makes the girl prove her own value before giving any attention vs giving ALL of his attention just because she looked at him. Often a stoic.\n\nFemales want to feel respected, loved, valued, secure, and safe - but they do not want you to be a fucking **BOY** about it. Men are more logically oriented and females are more emotionally oriented. That is simply how we are naturally hardwired. That's why females are more present in the moment and pick up on vibes and emotions a lot more than males, and why males **overthink the literal fuck out of EVERYTHING. NEWS FLASH MY DUDES -** ***WOMEN DEFY LOGIC FOR A REASON!!!***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo conclude: \n\nLove yourself before you try to love someone else as doing so will make it effortless.\n\nYOU are the most important person to YOU in YOUR own life. Don't throw yourself away.\n\nIf someone else does not love you, it is not because there is something wrong with you - they are simply not interested. Accept this and move on. There are 7.7 BILLION other people in the world.\n\nThe best love is found in friends and family. **Just because a relationship is platonic now does not mean it always will be. It is very easy to get out of the friend-zone as long as you don't** ***keep yourself there*****!!! The friend-zone is almost always** ***a test to see how you will react!!! Don't flunk this test because it is honestly not that hard.*** **The foundation of any and every relationship ALWAYS starts as friends or at the very least friendly strangers.** \n\n**\"This person is like my best friend but we're also so much more than best friends. I love this person so much\" -** ***NOTICE HOW \"BEST FRIEND\" IS THE FIRST THING THAT IS MENTIONED!*** **If for some reason the relationship fails and you break-up, you should be able to stay healthy friends without having a catastrophic \"I HATE YOU GTFO OF MY LIFE YOU VILE FUCK!!!!!\" situation because you feel hurt or abandoned. This is WHY people get friend-zoned, because often one person can tell they are not ready for a romantic/sexual relationship and need a friend instead. Take this as a blessing in disguise. If a girl/guy cares enough to friend-zone you and** ***still gives you the time of day as if you matter to them, it is often only temporary because they want you to realize something about yourself. Don't take it so personally and instead learn from it.***\n\nNo matter WHAT happens in your life, you should NEVER stop loving yourself. If you do not love or believe in your own self, how can you expect another person to do it to you? People want to do it **with you, not FOR you**. Coexist without being Codependent. That is the key to a healthy relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch Love to all of you and may all your dreams come true!", "title": "Loving Yourself When Nobody Else Loves You"}, {"created_utc": 1584390731, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fjruoy/just_a_little_message_that_got_me_in_a_lovely_mood/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was talking with my gf and we're both living in France.\nThis morning, we already knew that total containment would be announced and applied.\n\nWe planned to see each other by the end of the next week but we can't until the end of the containment, roughly 2 months.\n\nAnd so she just said on discord \"I would have loved to see you one last time\"", "title": "Just a little message that got me in a lovely mood"}, {"created_utc": 1584387690, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fjr05m/being_honest_to_myself_but_also_confusing_myself/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "so basically im 19 going 20 male and im in a 3 year relationship with someone i met when i was 16 and im just confused about the word love do i love this girl cause i know if i seen her with someone else it would break me and if i dont anything to hurt her it would break me but im always second guessing myself about love do i love this girl, what is love and my mind always just go into shambles and i listen to slow piano and singing music aka rn and i can stop thinking about another girl i was friends with for years on end and being best friends with her and still am i think i want her but then i text my girlfriend and i dont think anymore\n\nthis probably doesnt make any sense in english cause im typing from a confused 19 year old brain that thinks its different from everyone else who knows i dunno how anyone will answer this but yea give it ago or hmu", "title": "being honest to myself but also confusing myself"}, {"created_utc": 1584384599, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fjq44i/how_would_you_describe_an_old_school_romantic/", "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "How would you describe an \"old school romantic\" ?"}, {"created_utc": 1584383314, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fjpr0y/google_home_messages/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "My boyfriend and I recently set up a Google Home Mini in our apartment, and he loves it.

It's something I really don't like about white girls and from my experience a lot of them feel entitled to too much, which often means they wait too long and end up being too late and no longer suitable as marriage material. Perhaps it's a cultural thing, yet it appears to me that there just isn't that much to like about women who aren't geared toward having a family. I don't care about career women. They aren't attractive. If she's married, fine you can work on making business better. If not, she shouldn't waste time in the business world until she is because the difficultly she faces for relationships grows exponentially due to time constraints. You really can't blame men when you no longer have time to form a functional deep relationship. This is what they don't tell you about career women. It's observable from Okcupid stats on the perception of attractiveness and online dating services. \n\nSo it comes to the thing that I want: love; and by extension commitment toward a future family. What I found is that Asian women are willing to provide way more than other women. It's easy, however easy in a good way. Having a woman who texts me every day, constantly wants to love me is a great experience. I get to talk about her ass/body and she loves it, while also being very intimate and caring. It feels really good, and that's the type of thing that makes me feel she's really committed to it. It's not a full relationship yet, but it's 90% of the way there. It's a very stark contrast to the snooty, entitled woman that feels she is entitled to so much more than she has to offer.\n\nI believe it is the cure to a lot of relationship problems in western countries. It doesn't have anything to do with \"yellow fever\" or a fetish. When other women are providing better fulfillment, love and are family oriented, that's a direct indicator to single women to follow it or get left behind. It's a free market. Making signs about how you won't do that, how men are bad, how you won't compromise for men etc is counterproductive and they end up permanently single or in bad relationships. This is a great trend with love because it reemphasizes the need to get a partner before other women do, and it's only gaining in momentum. As much as a lot of people want to complain about relationships today, there's a lot of good that can happen if people are positive and focus on what they want so long as it isn't absurd. Eventually I can see normalization when it becomes abundantly clear that men would rather give Asians attention, not because they are Asian(although some people do that), but for the personality trait of high commitment. It's a knock-on effect for the rest of society. More people will be jealous and depressed, but that should give them a reason to change.\n\nYou'll get the type of women/man that suits you if you look for simple features in a person. It's not that hard, and it will only get better. Focus your time and energy on the women who want you and completely ignore women who don't or only want attention/money. And when you have that, other women who are normally on the fence also become more attracted to you. It's well known in behavior ecology that there are two truths: 1) humans copy other humans for mating strategies; 2) females are more attracted to men that have female affection because that shows the male is desirable. I gained a massive amount of self-confidence because of it.\n\nWhile the dating market may seem bleak and disrupted, it will change for the better.", "title": "Asians. Wonderful women to love.

It shouldn't be. When people feel a connection, things shouldn't get in the way. Love is kind of \"half-magic\". In the sense that while it is a beautiful thing, it does take effort to both actually start and maintain. Love is less about the flirty looks or cute texts, and more about being there when needed, passing through the storm and smiling at the end. It's about caring for another and allowing them to understand themselves. It is also about leaving when nothing is given back, not hatefully, but sadly. Every love can happen, if both parties communicate and are open to a very important thing that has become a lost art today. Change.\n\nBecause... it's a strange paradox we have nowadays. These days we are free. To love and feel loved by anyone we want, in any way we want. To explore as much as we want. And because we are so free... we are completely chained. \n\nPeople now spend so much time overthinking life, where every relationship is almost like a job. People spend so much time analyzing their sexuality, their social status, their options around, that when someone who really demonstrates interest and real care shows up, they are immediately sent to the pile of other people. \n\nThis shows the true facade. Because people aren't really free. They are running away. As long as they can find a reason to. Maybe they haven't tried too many options. Maybe they aren't ready yet. Maybe they can find someone better on tinder on the next swipe. Maybe they are just aromantic and are better alone. Maybe, maybe, maybe. It's fine to be who you are, and choose your sexuality, but we need to be ready when the time comes. No, this doesn't mean completely and mentally ready. No one is. Being ready means ready to take a chance.\n\nLove demands work. Love is about letting go of some of your plans because the other needs the time more. Love demands attention, it demands time. It's not a problem. It's the most beautiful part of it. It's knowing that someone is willingly doing that. They are happy to, even though they could be doing something else with that time. But again, that demands effort. But sadly, today, people are afraid. Afraid of not being free. And in that cage of freedom and easily fake happiness is where they stay. Unable to actually experience everything.\n\nSo unfortunately... yes. It is a crime to fall in love with someone. Because nowadays you need to be free. You need to only love yourself. You need to have gone through all the experiences, you need to have tried everything, to have all the money and status and to be completely happy and mentally stable with all your problems and bad luck.

So we were children then when we met. I was immediately head over heels for him. I was obsessed. I would do the most embarrassing things just to try and impress him (I would always end up failing though). I would try to play soccer with him in the field, but I would end up tripping or being hit by the ball (he would come to my treatment though, I guess love is pain). I even joined in the swimming carnival just to almost drown most of the time (he was a swimmer), just to try to impress him. I would literally do almost anything to try to \u201clook good\u201d in his eyes. I would even stay up all night just to write love letters to him. I would give it to my (ex)best friend to send to him, but I only recently found out that he never received them (turns out my friend never gave the letters). It was a very childish but memorable phase that I would never forget. But then bad news came. I had to switch schools ASAP. I was heartbroken that I would never get to see him. In the end though, right before I left, I had mustered up the courage to confess my feelings to him. But as a stupid child I were, I ran away before hearing his reply. \n\nI never forgot about him...\n\nFast forward to around a few years later, I mustered up the courage again to send him a message once I noticed he finally had social media. We talked for a bit then I finally found out he also had the same feelings. Sadly, it was all behind in the past. We laughed about how childish we were then. He\u2019s moved on from everything and I\u2019m here stuck in the past. \n\nNow around several years since the incident, I am still here, remembering and cherishing my one and only puppy love. I\u2019ve tried to be with a few other people but I never felt the urge to be committed, nor did I ever fall in love with them at all. In the end, I could never really find anyone like him. He\u2019s my puppy love, and frankly, the basis of my \u201cGolden Standard.\u201d \n\nTo my puppy love, I\u2019d just like to thank you for those childhood memories. I\u2019ll never forget them.

I was the second. He worked silently and would momentarily look up and raise his left eyebrow to acknowledge my arrival, no smiles no good mornings it was always a raised eyebrow and a quick nod. I would position myself a few desks away from him where his back is turned so I don't have the need to initiate small talk. The first couple of weeks the silence was definitely awkward, at least for me. On the third week, he brought speakers and played one of my favorite songs. I hummed softly while working at my desk and I swear for a split second I saw him glance towards my direction and he raised an eyebrow quizzically. Was I starting to imagine things? I composed myself and jumped right back to work. The next day the speakers were nowhere to be found. \n\n\nWe always had an hour to ourselves before people start to come into the office. Just on the first month I have already memorized his routine. I'd walk in he'd give me a nod and after a couple of minutes he'd step out to grab his coffee. Once he comes back he opens his backpack and would bring out a bar of Snickers or a snack pack of peanut M&amp;M's together with what looked like vitamin supplements. He brings out his headphones chug some water to down his pills then would put on some music and goes back to work. This would take him around 5-7 minutes. Then it would be my turn to step out and make my coffee go to the smoking area for a quick cigarette break. I get back to my station and as usual he's glued to his screen. I would only get one greeting a day, no more no less. \n\n\nThis is what our mornings would look like. It felt somewhat comforting for some reason. It was something I look forward to everyday. I liked that I started my day with him. It felt familiar. It felt calm.\n\n\nOne day I came to work later than usual. I was sick but I couldn't afford to skip work because I had a deadline. I was just sneezing everywhere. I ran to the washroom to grab tissues and when I came back to my desk I was surprised to see a blister pack of vitamin C's but he was nowhere to be found. I figured nobody else would give this to me but him. So I popped one and found myself feeling better already. Making a mental note that I should thank him later personally. It was quite late when I finished my proposal and I found myself alone in the office. I packed my stuff and went to the smoking area to cap my day off with a cigarette.\n\n\nUsually when I work this late I would have the smoking area to myself. However when I opened the door I was surprised to see him standing there smoking a cigarette. I was taken aback and ended up dropping my files. While I tried to pick them up I swear I saw him glance my way and raise an eyebrow again. This time I was sure I was not imagining it. He handed me one of my files and gave me a small smile. I thanked him and opened my bag to get my cigarette. When I looked up with a cigarette in my mouth he was inches away from my face and I almost choked. He brought out a lighter and proceeded to light my stick with one swift motion. I inhaled so hard I thought I was going to finish a stick with one go. He walked towards the exit and I realized I never thanked him for the pills. So I yelled almost a bit to loud and said Sir. He stopped and raised his hand as if to say it's no big deal and he was gone. I whispered thank you under my breath and wondered how can I be such a klutz.\n\n\nMonths passed and the nods turned into smiles. The cigarette breaks turned into casual conversations. I told myself nothing will ever come out of this because first, he was my boss and second, I'm pretty sure he's dating the new manager from the other team. I'd see her bring him coffee every morning. And would always ask him to have lunch with her every day. \n\n\nOne morning I came in and he wasn't in his usual spot. I asked around and apparently he was transferred to a different site. I'm not emotional but I slumped to my desk and started crying. That's when I noticed a small speaker on my left. With a post-it that says: \"You have good taste, so I'll let you have this.\" There wasn't a signature or anything but I know I've seen these speakers before. I knew. At least he said goodbye.\n\n\nI would still start my day the same and would always find myself staring at his desk. We had the same routine for almost 2 years. I searched for him in social media and would stalk his profile for days. Finally, I decided to muster up all my courage and added him as a friend. It took weeks before he connected with me. But a day after I got a message, it was from him. \n\nBoss: Hey! How are you and the team doing?\nMe: We're doing just great! We kinda miss you tho.\nBoss: It's nice to be missed. I heard you're up for promotion? Congratulations!\nMe: I'm crossing my fingers but I still have data that I would need to work on and I can't seem to figure it out.\nBoss: Maybe I can be of assistance. Send them over.\nMe: No I don't want to trouble you with these things.\nBoss: Send them over. I didn't say I'll do it for you did I? I just wanted to take a quick look and sort it out.\nMe: Sent! Thank you sir! \n\nBefore my shift ended he sent me another message\n\nBoss: You still in the office?\nMe: About to head out.\nBoss: I've seen some discrepancies on the data I need to show you. Can you spare me 15 minutes?\nMe: Even if it takes hours I won't mind. Besides I'm the one hogging all your time.\nBoss: Meet you in the lobby at 5.\nMe: See you sir. And thanks again.\n\n\nThe moment I stepped inside the elevator my legs turned into mush. It's been months since I last saw him. And I've always managed to look like an idiot whenever we get the chance to talk. I hurriedly put on some lipstick and fixed my hair. When the elevator doors opened he was there, but I was taken aback. He was wearing a plain white shirt, a pair of 501s and white Chuck Taylor's that has definitely seen better days together with a black baseball cap.\n\n\nI couldn't talk for a full minute. I was in complete and utter shock.\n\n\nI've never seen him outside of his office clothes. He usually sports tailor fitted black slacks, leather shoes and pair it with a white crisp shirt and would roll his sleeves up to his elbows. His office clothes was always impeccable and tastefully put together. \n\n\nBUT NOTHING BEATS JEANS, CHUCKS AND A PLAIN WHITE SHIRT.\n\n\nHe waved and signaled me to follow him to his car. He opened the door to the passenger seat and put my seatbelt on for me. I almost melted. I knew he wasn't wearing any perfume but he distinctly smelled like fresh linen and musk. I was going to pass out.\n\n\nWe drove for a bit and he started discussing the data. He was always excited when it came to these things. I've always thought that data analysis would give him a raging boner. I chuckled out loud and he raised an eyebrow. And asked me: \"Were you making fun of me just this time?\" And I politely told him that he would always get excited when it came to these things. And I would see him light up whenever he figured something out. And he gave me the eyebrow raise again and leaned over to kiss me on the lips.\n\n\nI was shocked but I finally gave in and just went for it without any hesitation. Thoughts racing through my head while he tucks a strand of hair inside my ear. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE YOU DOING? But yes the flesh is weak so we ended up making out for an hour before we came up for air. His first words were: \"I have been waiting for years to do that. And it's better than what I've imagined.\"\n\n\nI was still in total shock that I couldn't speak. He would look at me from time to time while he was driving while I was just sitting there looking like a complete idiot. The next thing I know I was in front of my house and he was dropping me off. He handed me the file and said he sent me an email for the presentation. By the time I could speak he was already gone.\n\n\nWe never went on dates. Instead he would have me come over to his place and talk for hours. We would drink smoke and stay up. Talk about our lives and not worry about being judged. We would talk about everything and anything under the sun. We were not afraid to be ourselves. He would feed me, cuddle with me and have mind-blowing sex with me. I'd stay there for days. It was perfect. Except it wasn't.\n\n\nHe made it clear from the get go that he doesn't do relationships. If there was anything he loved the most. It was his freedom, his independence. I knew he had other girls over but they are not allowed to sleep over. The terms were clear. I agreed to it as long as he practiced safe sex. My goal was to be the last woman standing. I endured everything. I didn't complain. I did everything just to make him realize I was not one to let go. I never once told him how much I love him. I partly succeeded. I was the only girl who he hung out with and dropped the others without notice. He never told me. But I knew.\n\n\nThen one day he told me he was going to be relocated again. This time it was overseas. I panicked because we were making so much progress. We even went on dates now. In public! But again I had no choice but to let him go. \n\n\nHe called me almost every day and he seemed to look so much happier. He looked radiant. He sent me tickets to visit him over the weekend but I declined. Scared I might cling onto him like glue and wound not want to leave. He talked about work like it was some exciting adventure. He went to treks, virgin beaches and explored every nook and cranny of the island. He was back in his element. This was the guy I was watching from afar. He's back. He's finally back.\n\n\nThen it dawned on me. I can never make him this happy. Even if I devoted my entire life to him. I could compete with other women but never against his one true love. Freedom. \n\n\nWhen he came back he was just glowing. He had colors on his cheeks and he looked so much healthier. I was happy that he was happy. But I needed to tell him how I feel. When we got back in his place I started to cry. I never cried in front of him. I was scared he might freak out and kick me out of the house. Instead he handed me a cigarette and lit it up. And told me to talk about it. As soon as he said that words just kept flowing out of my mouth. I told him everything. Everything. And when I was done he gave me a glass of water and told me if this was a different place in a different time he would have even married me. \n\n\nI've never heard him talk about his feelings for the past couple of years. He hugged me and kissed my forehead. And told me he would hate to see me go but he would never stop me from doing so. And told me as much as he cares for me he lives his life as he pleases. He likes his alone time and considers it sacred. He does not want to burden me or hurt me because there is nothing wrong with me. It wasn't about me. It was never about me. I should not take it personally. \n\n\nAnd now I finally get it. I used to think I wasn't enough. Not pretty enough. Not smart enough. Not sexy enough. But I was looking at it all wrong. I was selfish. What I didn't see was him helping me further my career, pushing me to learn new things, and helped me discover who I really was and definitely helped me put things into perspective. And now I think I like being with myself more.\n\n\nHe did love me, not just the way I wanted him to. Our love might not be conventional, it might not even be considered normal. But who cares right? I'm happy he's happy. That's all that matters. I haven't created an ending for this story yet because plainly put I don't think it would be ending anytime soon.\n\n\nPS: It's a long read I know.

And my god, I\u2019m so in love with him. It feels like I\u2019ve known him forever. We\u2019ve grown a lot and have both acknowledged and worked on our toxic traits. We are still growing and getting to know each other. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever saw myself wanting to marry (in the very far future, we both have goals to achieve before that). It feels natural talking about those things though, and I love that he\u2019s accepted all of me and has handled my depressive episodes with lots of care and understanding. He\u2019s taught me a lot about the importance of communication. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s wild feeling this way. I was in a relationship for 5 years with an older guy (14 years my senior) before him and I didn\u2019t experience this. I\u2019ve realized now that though I loved and cared for that man, I wasn\u2019t IN love with him, and honestly felt trapped. There was a year and a half break of guys before I met current bf. We met at a party neither of us wanted to be at, and started out as lovers not wanting to be serious because A) we were long distance and B) I was planning to leave for Korea. Then just a couple of months into it we became exclusive. And I ended up moving down to be closer to family and him. I still plan on going to Korea to pursue my dreams but Covid has put a halt to it. We plan to work through it, which I have hope for given the industry he works in. He supports my dreams 100% and I\u2019m really hoping he\u2019s the last bf for me. I\u2019m typing this out as I lay next to him snoring very loudly lol but I love every minute of being with him. I\u2019m genuinely happy that I have him in my life. Last week was really rough for me and I know I was super moody and pushed him away. It hurt him knowing that he couldn\u2019t make things better for me and I feel bad about that (again we still have some growing to do), but he\u2019s never given up on us or me and I know he cares. I do my best to show him that I care about him too. I have this silly jar stuffed with reasons why I love him but I\u2019ve been hesitant to give it to him. I just can\u2019t find the right time and honestly I feel a little embarrassed about handing it over. I feel like a school girl with a crush or something. And man he kinda makes me feel that way all of the time. I still get butterflies from time to time when he kisses me. Today he gave me the sweetest forehead kiss and I thought I would melt. And the back of the neck kisses fucking drive me wild! I\u2019ve read posts about how love is hard, love isn\u2019t always exciting, and in real life you don\u2019t experience the movie version of love.  And yeah I agree to an extent, but overall, at least in my current experience, love IS always exciting and only hard when we have tension to work through. And it does feel like a rom com movie love sometimes, despite him not being the most romantic guy. But what I love is that he\u2019s willing to try to do more romantic things because he knows it makes me happy. And I reciprocate those gestures because I think he deserves to feel like he\u2019s got a movie love too sometimes. Okay that\u2019s it.

We met in college. She was so great that it was hard not to fall for her. She had everything that I found in a girl attractive. I never felt that way before. I confessed to her. But she did not feel the same way about me. I was very heart broken and sad. I badly wanted to be with her that I screwed up my social life.\n\nFrom January, 2020 to March till COVID-19 hit the world, I remember absolutely nothing about my college studies and activities. All my thoughts were about her. I prayed to be with her, I used to cry alone in my room because of pain. But I knew it would never happen. I always knew that she will never be with me. Still I fell for her. I knew I would get hurt eventually, but I could not resist it.\n\nI became annoying and irritating to my friends. I started being lonely and distanced myself from my them. But my friends were supportive. The girl also was so good that she put up with a lot of my shit. I used to constantly message her trying to convince and always tried to converse with her. I was afraid that I will lose her. \n\nI should not have done that. I annoyed her very much and crossed my boundaries. But she handled it well. She never asked me to get lost or to stay away from her. Instead she became a good friend and never stop talking to me, just to make me feel good, even if she did not want to. She asked me to get over her and she helped me to do it. I know it sounds crazy, but the girl I was madly in love with helped me to move on.\n\nWe made some ground rules. She used to get annoyed of me asking her to by my girlfriend everyday. So she asked me to never mention that I want a relationship with her. I was afraid to lose her so I prioritised friendship over relationship. But it was never easy. I wanted to talk to her all day long. She even helped me with this obsession.\n\nShe talked to me but mentioned that she was only doing this because of me. She really did not like to do it everyday. This made me realise slowly that I cannot force myself on her. She was already putting up with a lot of my annoyance. She could have simply blocked me and told me to fuck off. But she did not. She helped me to find my self worth again.\n\nI eventually got over her. But during the process, we used to talk. She never forced me to cut ties with her. We became good friends and eventually I understood that I made her go through a lot of trouble which she did not deserve. I accepted the fact that she was not for me. This acceptance helped me a lot.\n\nBut I questioned a lot of things during this process. Why love hurts so much? Why we can't get the person we love to be with us? I always thought that I don't deserve the pain I'm going through. Yes the other person has her choice but what about our choice. What about our choice that we want to be with someone?\n\nThe whole thing was so painful that I forgot about my own identity and self love. I longed for someone else's love. I wanted someone to love me, hold me in their arms, kiss me, listen to my stupid talks. I used to think that if I don't find someone I will never have love in my life. During the last stages of my affection for her, I talked with another girl.\n\nShe used to like me and wanted a relationship with me. But, my obsession for the first girl hurt me so much that I got exhausted at last. I just wanted to be with no one. But I talked to her anyways. While talking to her I kinda forgot that I was madly in love with someone. She again asked if we could date.\n\nBut I rejected her. I felt that I would be doing injustice to her because I knew I was using her to get over the other girl. I was feeling so guilty and angry with myself. Sometimes I used to feel that I do not deserve to be loved at all. But time passed. I completely moved on. I am enjoying spending time only for myself.  \n\nBut this whole incident had shaken my beliefs in love. Will I have someone in my life who I love and will love me back. I don't want to go through the pain of heartbreak again. I dont have it in me.

She said to me that she  loved him (basically, she likes him more than she likes me) and that he  made her feel very well, even though they were never close to each  other.

She told me that she was sorry, because she  couldn't controll her feelings, and that she had illuded me for some  time. I kinda accepted it, but felt like shit. After talking, I layed  down on her bed, and just started looking to her. Things escalated, and  it got to the point where we were french kissing for over 2 hours  straight.

I was pure darkness, you were pure light, and your heart attempted to walk on the barriers of fire and ice and heartbreak that had built themselves within me.

I wonder what you will brighten in days to come, if you will continue to enchant, enchant, enchant, or if that light will dissolve. I wonder what will come for you, what will come for me. What we will become.\n\nI wonder what you are doing at this moment.

But the problem is not enough of these swipes are actually turning into real date's. So here are five tips for turning tinder messages into actual meet ups. \n\n# Tinder Tip 1:\n\nThis one is a profile hack so this is something you could do in your actual profile to make it more likely that he asks you on a date. You say in the bio: \u201cAlways on search for the best gelato in town\u201d Men are looking for a conversation starter besides just the way you look in a profile so when you give them something to latch on to you also give them a concrete idea for what to do with you.\n\n# Tinder Tip 2: Act like a human being \n\nOn tinder, people play it like it's a video game and they have no human emotions and when we don't feel like we're dealing with human beings we lose our empathy and we stop treating them like human beings. If you want to be treated like an individual like a person like a person that's worth taking out and spending time with we have to start acting human.\n\nHow you do that in your messages you say things like \u201cI'm spending time with my niece today, it's so amazing\u201d or \u201cme and my sister are going out tonight she just got to town and I missed her so much\u201d or you could say \u201cWent and saw a scary movie. Horrible idea- I\u2019m still freaked out :\u2019)\u201d(with scared emoji)\n\nEssentially, anything that shows you to have a little more depth friends, family, human emotions, vulnerability, these are the things that actually reveal more about us.\n\n# Tinder Tip 3:\n\nShow him that he stood out to you. What that means is actually pay him a bit of a compliment say to him \u201cYou seem like one of the few people on here that actually sounds like a human being lol\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should exchange numbers and see if we get on over the phone ;)\u201d by the way when you say we should see if we get on over the phone you're giving him an extra challenge to deal with. You have to impress me on the phone before we go out on the date.\n\nYou can also be a bit more direct and say \u201cHere's my number we should grab a coffee sometime you seem like an interesting guy\u201d.  You seem like an interesting guy is a nice embedded compliment but at the same time it's not like you're saying I know enough to know you are an interesting guy you just seem that way but I'm now giving you a reason to want to meet up with me. I've given you a positive identity for you to fulfill.\n\n# Tinder Tip 4: Give tinder addicts a bad name \n\nThat means when you've been messaging back and forth with a guy for a while send him a message and say \u201cOkay gotta go headed out with friends. You should [text](https://medium.com/p/how-to-text-a-guy-3-texting-secrets-men-cant-resist-a6261f33e784) me sometime so we don't become those weird tinder people who never actually talk ;)\u201d \n\nHis likely response is to say \u201cI don't have your number\u201d then you can fire it back to him and he now gets to follow up by not being one of those tinder people \n\n# Tinder Tip 5: Remember\n\nCall people don't make a big deal out of meeting up, so if you find yourself messaging back and forth incessantly on tinder all you need to say is this \u201cwell, feel free to say hi in person sometime. I'm around before meeting friends later tonight if you want to grab a drink. Otherwise catch you soon.\u201d \n\nSee the thing about that is it shows that he's not even a blip on the radar of your week you have so many things going on that he's not that important for you to make a big deal out of how to meet up you, just throw it out there casually.\n\nLook, tinder is something that most people play like it's a video game, wasting hours and hours on something that's utterly fruitless. It's not a video game, it's something that's there to create opportunities for your actual real life just like any dating website or app it is just a tool.\n\nSo instead of using it to waste hours of your precious life, use it to build your life and have real experiences and see what might come of it.\n\nBe bold, be authentic, don't be afraid to ask what you want and certainly do not suffer time wasters.", "title": "5 Tinder Tips To Get Him To Ask You Out"}, {"created_utc": 1617996662, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mnos4k/he_asked_for_my_ring_size/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve blissfully been with my partner for over 6 years, moved-in together as best friends in college and quickly started dating.

My parents are still together and even though physically like to hug and kiss each other in public never really showed what love was to them outside of that. But I got to see the behind closed doors acts of my mother screaming and my dad gaslighting and invalidating her experience before that was turned on me and my siblings. \n\nI grew up and got into an abusive relationship at 17, was in it for 2 1/2years and left that one to later find a toxic relationship. I thought that love had to hurt and that you had to get through these major tough times to have some good times. I thought you had to stay up crying your feelings out because when you tried to talk about them you were told how to feel or that you were overreacting. \n\nThat was until he(23M) came into my life. We met off of Tinder, our first date we went to a bar and he spent an hour and a half passionately talking about having your own style as an artist (we\u2019re both artists, he\u2019s currently freelancing and doing so many interviews and projects all at once). The twinkle in his eyes was mesmerizing and I couldnt take my eyes away. I sat there face in my hands just enjoying and listening and not wanting him to stop talking. In the beginning we hung out maybe once every two weeks. Then we started seeing each other once a week and now a couple times a week. \n\nI told him earlier this month that I was moving to Oregon going to move in with my grandmother because she has a blood disorder. The next day was his birthday and he called me at midnight to ask if he could come over. He came over and started crying, he told me that with work he hadn\u2019t gotten the time to think about us yet, or taking time to process the feelings that he had about us. He told me that he was frustrated because just as he started being vulnerable with me unlike anybody else before me that I told him I was leaving.  He told me he was not expecting anything to have come out of us being casual but that he really liked me now and he never expected to like me as much as he did. We ended up having so many break down conversations where we held one another and talked and validated one another\u2019s feelings. It was unlike anything I\u2019d had before. \n\nHe asked if we could actually go on a date the next day and it was one of the best days of my entire life. We ended up going to go on a hike and saw bison at one of my favorite hiking spots, then we went to one of my favorite stargazing spots and had a picnic under the stars we listen to music and talked, he took me to his favorite spots which was on the top of the dam. We listened to music again I and danced. He held my hand the entire time and kissed me even know he doesn\u2019t like PDA. He literally had told me he never felt comfortable enough with anyone else to do PDA but wanted to work on those feelings with me. \n\nHe made a point to come over on his free time when he only had an hour to two with working on such big projects and having so much craziness on life just to see me just to hang out for a little bit. Every time we hung out it was amazing. I ended up breaking down after a little while of us hanging out because I realized that I loved him and I was scared because before him love and pain came hand in hand and you couldn\u2019t have one without the other. I was terrified of having a connection be tainted in that way again. I started working these doubts and feelings out on my own. \n\nHe has always open with how much he liked me and how much he liked hanging out with me and being with me which honestly he made me feel more safe than I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. And I realized that I wanted to feel that safe when I was by myself that I didn\u2019t wanna rely on him and take it to the point of codependency like my previous relationships. I wanted this one to be different, I wanted this one to actually work out. So I continued working on myself and trying to be vulnerable, which is absolutely it\u2019s terrifying but he was worth it I know (Ik I keep using that word but it is). \n\nHe came over again and we held each other for a while and then I was hella awkward but I told him that I loved him. I told him that every time I hung around him he felt like home, a home I had never had dreamed about before, and that he had a way to break down all these walls and make me feel completely safe at the same time. He had a way to make it so that my bad days just immediately dissipate when I stared into his light blue eyes. He made me want to be better and strive to be better not only for him for myself. Then took his face in my hands and I told him I loved him. \n\nHe told me he hadn\u2019t heard someone say that besides his mom. That he hadn\u2019t processed feelings that he had with all the work he was doing. But he assured me that he never felt this way with anyone else before and then he really really liked me. He stayed up till 3 AM talking to me and we were full of awkwardness and smiles that were genuine. I told him that we should put a pin in the conversation until I got back in two months and he should take some time for work and processing things. He took it as me not wanting to see him anymore before I left and freaked out a little so I clarified. He was super excited I still wanted to see him. \n\nI just wanted him to have time and take things at his own pace, not to rush it for me. I\u2019m absolutely terrified of leaving especially after all of this but I know I need to. So I\u2019ll keep dreaming of coming back to his open arms and lovely smile until it actually happens. \ud83d\udc95", "title": "I\u2019m in love an this time it hurts in a different way."}, {"created_utc": 1617984638, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mnkm17/how_do_i_show_affection_through_text/", "num_comments": 7, "score": 1, "selftext": "hi! i\u2019ve been talking to this guy for around 7 months ( we dated for a month but mutually agreed we didn\u2019t want labels anymore) and it\u2019s a long distance relationship. we said ily around a month ago and i honestly have never felt this way about anyone before. i\u2019ve always had a problem with not being able to express my love through text or in person but i care about him so much and i want him to know it. he\u2019s going through a depressive episode right now and i want to talk to him and show him i love him but he hates talking about his emotions. how can i show it??", "title": "how do i show affection through text"}, {"created_utc": 1617983472, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mnk6az/i_love_love_and_need_your_stories/", "num_comments": 10, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m in that weird stage where I know I love this person but everything is new and developing (hopefully).

I thought love alone could overcome everything else, the love I showed someone could inspire them to overcome and adversity and that the love someone shows me could do the same. Love cured everything. That's what I believed, now I realise that cannot be true. Love is firstly such a vague and subjective word without a solid definition. We can attribute love to other things like trust, commitment or neurological chemicals and everyone's personal ideas shape their view of what love is. To me, love can no longer be the solution to everything because the concept itself is like a floating cloud. There are things that are objective, clear and can allow us to overcome things such as reflection, accountability, a sense of duty and a set of morals. Love itself is not it. To an extent my ideas were defined by my own insecurities and my lack of self love, I believed that I can make someone love me by showing them love and in doing so fill the void that I had within myself. Is that even love? Is that codependency? Regardless, love is not this thing that allows us to overperch stony limits because love itself is something that cannot be understood in definitive and objective ways. Moving forward, being someone who sees herself in a stable marriage and hopefully building a family I no longer see love as the first critrea or the only one. Marriage is a plan, it is a acknowledgement that we are imperfect beings that want something and want to work together to build something.

After about 6 months, Told him I liked him, he didn\u2019t feel that way. Cut contact with him to move on, regain my bearings. He didn\u2019t leave me alone, wanted to stay friends. I blocked him as it was too painful to stay friends with him.\n\nMet someone at 30, too much passion and romance, fell head over heels(mostly hormonal). After few months, asked him where it was going. He wanted to see other people still. I walked away.\n\nDating someone now. He has pretty much become my best friend. We speak everyday, spend 3 or 4 nights a week together. Recently had the talk to being exclusive after dating for 3 months. That night we slept the whole night hugging. I would like for him to be my forever person. We get along really well. We make a good team. I would like to have a future with him, travel with him. We have discussed this. May be have kids with him, grow old with him. These are just in my head, I don\u2019t know how much of it he really wants with me.

I\u2019m sure some of you will understand it but just really weirded both of us out to start with. Everything between us is literally perfect and we\u2019ve never even had an argument Because we\u2019re just able to talk things through and work it out. Neither of us can ever imagine leaving the other and everything is going great. \n\nBefore we met I had an ex girlfriend who I\u2019d lost my virginity too in a pretty forgettable way. I wasn\u2019t physically attracted to my ex, as bad as that is to say, I just wasn\u2019t. Which made sex very Unenjoyable and not something I looked forward too. On the other hand my Current girlfriend whilst being over a year younger than me has had numerous sexual partners. She had never been in a proper relationship but partook in a fair amount of casual meetups. I hate to even entertain the idea that she has or had done something wrong by sleeping with all these people before we met, but for some reason the way she casually mentions it just gets to me, thinking about her with those other guys just hurts. \n\nI don\u2019t blame her in the slightest for this, I blame myself for even thinking about it like this. Writing this pains me and it\u2019s taken a lot of courage for me personally to actually face this.\n\nAmong the people that she slept with is one of my old mates who was a really really terrible person and I knew how badly he treated girls. She even saw him the night after we had our first date and they didn\u2019t have sex but did other things that I asked her to not tell me about. This is the thing that gets to me the most, thinking about my perfect beautiful girl, my baby, getting fucked by my old mate in an abandoned building. \n\nI don\u2019t exactly know what I\u2019m asking for but I just felt like I needed to get this off my back and see if anyone had ever had a similar experience.

This is by no means a reason that I would seperate with her for, it just makes me uncomfortable to think about.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to her about my mate and I think that was really beneficial, but When she\u2019s joked about how many people I\u2019ve slept with only being one and then she asks if I\u2019d like to know how many she has, I don\u2019t have the courage to know, I want to know everything about her because I love every part of her, but I\u2019m afraid for some reason at finding out. I really don\u2019t know what to do, because this has just been something weighing on me the entire time I\u2019ve been with her, not a massive weight but still there.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is the right sub or not but I\u2019d really really just like someone to talk to about it or words of wisdom, because I love this girl so much and want to spend the rest of my life with Her, I\u2019d just like to get over this.

A tall handsome guy comes up to me and offers me a beer. He was exactly my type. We start talking, we click instantly, I felt so comfortable and in my own environment even though the house I was in had the worst vibes I ever felt. We talked all night, at 4 am I was about to leave and we discovered we lived on the same path so we took an uber together. After that night, we didn't really reach out again. But I knew right then and there, 4 years ago, that I had a crush on this guy. His energy was so pure and loving I automatically felt like I wanted him in my life. However my insecurities got the best of me and I never made a move because I thought he was out of my league.\n\nA few months later,   I met my ex boyfriend. We dated for a year, and he was my first boyfriend, and also my first time experiencing someone being verbally and physically abusive, manipulative and toxic under false pretenses of \"love\". He made me feel inadequate, like I didn't know how to be a girlfriend, like I was selfish and heartless. When I broke up with him, I felt so free. I knew I had to work on myself, but I was so happy to not feel like there was someone out there that hated me for who I was and was obsessed with trying to change me.\n\nA month after breaking up with my ex, I go to a friend's birthday. There I see him, my crush. I started gushing about him to one of my long-time guy friends, and he told me I should shoot my shot. I went up to him and started a conversation, then I told him I couldn't believe he was single. A blonde girl then came and dragged him out of the party to go somewhere else, he asked me if I was also going there, I said sure but I ended up going home. That night, my long-time friend who was also with me that night told me he thinks he might have feelings for me.\n\nA year later, I briefly dated that same long-time friend. I thought I could trust him, and I decided I would settle for dating him because it would be a safe bet. I was never really attracted to him but I felt like good guys didn't exist anymore and I just wanted peace of mind and companionship, even though I didn't really need it. He ended up being deeply troubled and gaslight me, and lied to me about things that I thought I was avoiding by being his friend first and supposedly getting some respect from him. I left this small relationship sad and confused, not understanding why people lie so much, why people could hurt others when the truth is so much easier.\n\nA week after I cried all the tears in my body, my long-time crush answered my instagram story. we had been talking sometimes on instagram, answering each other's stories, but very friendly. on a drunk night when my friends were trying to cheer me up, my girl saw that I was talking to him and asked me why I was smiling. She quickly took my phone and asked him to hang out sometimes. I was so afraid she did that, but to my surprise he agreed, and asked me to hangout 2 days later. \n\nThat night he came over (it was cold outside and everything was closed due to the pandemic). I had never been this nervous in my life, as I had never hung out with a guy that I liked. I always settled for whoever liked me. He came over around 8pm and we drank wine and talked till 4 in the morning. I couldn't believe it happened. After all these years we hang out, and it's better than what I could've imagined. \n\nThis pretty much set the tone for the rest of our dates, where for the first month we would just hang out and watch movies, talk, laugh and drink till the early hours of the day. \n\nAfter a month we still hadn't slept with each other, as I told him I wanted to get to know him more. Truth is sex has never been a big deal to me but I wanted it to be special with him for some reason. He respected that and we waited. When we finally did it, I couldn't believe how good it felt. Like you just can't have a physical and mental connection with someone this good,  nothing is ever THIS perfect. \n\nWe hung out a few more times, and then we both became very busy. For a few months we didn't see each other, maybe once a month, but we'd regularly talk and send each other funny things. We decided to see each other when we can, and just enjoy the present moment and not worry about expectations and where this could lead, as long as we both know how we feel. I still feel so nervous when I talk to him, because I can't believe that someone understands me this much and feels everything the same way that I do and thinks the same way that I do. We love all the same things, and he told me he tells his friends about things I enjoy and they're all are surprised  that I exist. I'm surprised because it seems that this man was perfectly crafted by the Gods for me. \n\nThis weekend we finally hung out again, we walked the whole city and talked and laughed and share stories and experiences. He made me feel like i mattered, like i was somebody. \n\nhow beautiful it is to have all your worries answered, like he was picking them up one by one from my brain and soothing them with his sweet voice.\n\nand we made love that night and as i felt our bodies crushed into each other he said \u201cgod i missed this\u201d and i wanted to scream me too. ive never felt like someone\u2019s body could make me crave them so much, and their pure soul make me adore them just as such. \n\nWe're taking our time to get to know each other, but the way he has always been honest and straight forward with me makes me not even care about a title, because I know that most relationships with titles these days don't even have the range of truth we give each other. I got a good feeling about this one. Everyday I toss and turn in my head thinking about how me from 4 years ago would react if she saw this happening today. Like this situation exceeded all my expectations and wishes. And if I end up hurting myself, i will see it as a lesson that angels still exist, and they make your days just a little bit brighter. \n\nlove is scary as fuck!!!!!!! but its also kind of the only reason to be alive i think.", "title": "thanking the universe."}, {"created_utc": 1617840486, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mmfiz2/every_day_is_better_than_the_last/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Every day is better than the last."}, {"created_utc": 1617840182, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mmffn5/my_fianc\u00e9_left_his_phone_at_home/", "num_comments": 24, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m off of work today.

She said she has depression and anxiety; she has also said she often has trouble sleeping at night, which can lead her to be tired during the day and have headaches, which has been a contributing factor to relationship problems in the past.  Also, due to her sleep issue, sometimes she sleeps for quite a while during the day.\n\nWe have enjoyed our time together, and we have good conversations and things in common.  She has been very relaxed and chill, which I like.  Because she said she was looking for a friend that might lead to a relationship, I've been patient with her and not wanted to push things.  I recognized she's guarded and wants to take things slow.\n\nThere were times when we planned to meet up but she wasn't feeling well, and she said she was sorry and we met later.  She has told me she thinks I've been a good friend in being understanding and patient with her.  I've actually gotten to really like her, and we've told each other we like each other.\n\nI've realized I've developed some feelings for her.  The thing is, I feel like I've gotten mixed signals from her.  Aside from words, she seemed to be giving me some hints that she liked me - A few times, she kissed my cheek when we were saying goodbye, though she hasn't been doing that anymore.  She has cuddled with me a few times when watching TV.  Last week, we met for dinner and she said she wanted to tell me she really likes me, I'm the nicest guy she has met, but she just needs time - She said she has issues with compliments and affection, which she has been seeing a therapist for.  I said I've been falling for her, and she said she has been falling for me too.  I felt good to know she seemed to feel the same way I've been feeling.\n\nNow, a few days ago, we went shopping and she held my hand.  Then we watched some TV at my place, and she cuddled with me a bit.  Then she wanted to go home - and I had the courage to ask her if I could kiss her before she left.  She said no, she isn't ready for that yet.  After she left, I texted and said I'm sorry if I seemed to forward, and that I didn't want to do anything to make her uncomfortable.  She said I'm okay, she has been enjoying my friendship and isn't quite ready to take things to the next level yet.  I've been left confused, as she was holding my hand and cuddled a bit that same day.  She had recently said she has been falling for me.  And after 3 months, she doesn't feel ready for a kiss yet.  \n\nThe last couple days, it seems she has been a little distant (though after I had texted the other day and she didn't reply, she said she had fallen asleep after she got home from work).  There have also been times when she wouldn't reply to my text for hours, and she'd say she was sleeping (she can even be sleeping all day).  So she has been sometimes unavailable.  It has been hard on me, with feelings for her.  She has said she needs time, but I've been feeling a bit lonely and down and unfocused.\n\nI feel like I've been getting mixed signals from a lady I've been seeing for 3 months.  I have feelings for her that seem unrequited, and I've been feeling down about it.  Due to her issues, I've wondered if she may have an avoidant attachment style, or maybe she isn't interested in me (despite the signs she has given).  I also feel like it's unrequited love, and I've wondered if she may be talking to or seeing someone else.  I also hope I didn't put her off by asking if I could kiss her.\n\nIf she just needs time, would it be worth waiting for her?", "title": "Seeing someone who said she's ready for serious relationship - How to handle someone with affection issues, depression/anxiety?"}, {"created_utc": 1617828912, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mmbqya/im_available_for_hookup_service/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I\u2019m available for hookup service..."}, {"created_utc": 1617828168, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mmbht6/i_cant_anymore/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "I fucked up, again", "title": "I can't anymore"}, {"created_utc": 1617828167, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mmbhsw/i_got_a_hot_gf/", "num_comments": 7, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I got a hot gf \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd17"}, {"created_utc": 1617826147, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mmarwu/is_17_too_young_for_a_promise_ring/", "num_comments": 23, "score": 1, "selftext": "For context no I don't mean the traditional, Conservative Christian type of promise ring, i'm talking about a ring given alongside a promise (along the lines of \"loving you forever\" \"being faithful\" that kind of stuff) and just to have matching rings while we're away at college.\nI asked on r/relationship_advice on how to give it to him in a cute way but people mainly focus on the fact that we're too young, shouldn't stay together while we're in college or shouldn't waste money, I'm kind of reconsidering if it was even a good idea in the first place, I like the idea and I know he'd like it too but maybe we're too young yet.", "title": "Is 17 too young for a promise ring?"}, {"created_utc": 1617826073, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mmaqva/to_sweet_j/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "Dear J, for 4 years or so you have been a caretaker of me and I liked you from the start, always in such a good mood and nothing too much, you like what you do that shines through so was always liking it when you walked in, when you helped me, so much laughing.

I pursued one relationship out of desperation of loneliness, but after a few weeks of being together I knew I just didn\u2019t feel the same as he did and had to cut it off. I thought I liked him, crushed on him in the beginning but my heart quickly turned away from it. We never even kissed when we were together. \n\nI got to college, the dating pool widened. I spent countless nights swiping through Tinder; I planned and went on lots of first dates. However, with each first date, I never felt that \u201cspark.\u201d I had to sadly turn down offers for second dates and wonder what was wrong with me. I began to think I was aromantic and/or asexual and that the relationship life just wasn\u2019t for me. (This is not to invalidate those who are aro/ace though. You\u2019re valid and it\u2019s not that you just \u201chaven\u2019t met the right person. Anyway - ) Months went by and I spent less and less time on Tinder and more time working on myself. I fostered kittens, I started working, I got straight A\u2019s in my courses, and felt okay. \n\nI told myself I had 3 last chances before I put the whole dating thing aside and would just focus solely on life instead. I matched with a new guy. He felt a tad bit different. He responded quickly to my messages with full, conversational replies. He was genuinely interested in what I did, and had many passions and talents himself. We played minecraft together one night and decided to meet up for a hike a couple of days later.\n\nThe rest is history after that. I fell almost instantly for him. I don\u2019t know exactly why, but we just clicked. I\u2019m sure many others gush about their loves like this, but he is genuinely the best boyfriend I could ever ask for. We\u2019ve been together for 6 months and have never argued once, he has never made me upset and vice versa. \n\nHe has the prettiest blue eyes, and a dopey, loving smile that makes my heart flutter each time. He feels like coming home on a cold day to a warm fire, hot chocolate, and a cozy blanket. He\u2019ll excitedly tell me about Star Wars and I absolutely adore the way his eyes light up as he explains the complexity of Clone Wars and all the movies and so on. He\u2019s spontaneous just like I am, always ready to get in the car and drive 7 hours to Virginia for nothing more than to hold each other on a mountaintop while the sun sets. \n\n2021 has really thrown me for a loop as my health has taken a turn randomly, but he has been my rock through it all, my reason to smile and keep pushing on. \n\nLove is insane, huh? I feel so warm thinking about him. I cry about him a lot because of how strongly I feel about him. I can\u2019t wait to grow old with him. We have so many dreams, of living in a van, of traveling to Alaska, of painting and photographing the world.\n\nI love him.

I wish you would allow me to be there for you as you have been for me. You held my hand and slowly lead me out of depression. Your absence is a violent ache. I have tried so hard to let you go. Tried to hate you. Drank myself sick and said many things to you. The reality is, your the only living person I want. I miss your voice, your smile, looking deep in your eyes. I miss the deep connection I feel for you. I miss your smell, I miss your lips on mine. I miss the feeling of you on top of me, holding me and kissing me. Making me feel desired. I miss the way we held each other. I miss your smile when you caught my eyes. I miss talking to you. I miss the way you kissed my tattoos like you knew right where my emotional pain manifests. I miss your intuitive nature and the way you seemed to immediately read my facial expressions. L, I am so in love with you. I'd spend the rest of my life getting to know you if you'd let me.

Mere days after the pandemic was declared. Met is an overstatement, I liked his comment under a video game public Facebook post. And he messaged me. I first thought \"great another gaming dude who wants to chat\" so I said hi, told him to add me on steam and that was that.\n\nHe added me on steam and messaged me. I politely responded until I realized... wow we had a lot in common and my God, he was fascinating. We kept talking and playing games. He was in upstate New York and me, in French Canada.  Hours away but an eternity apart because the borders had been closed. \n\nEvery day I would follow the news of borders reopening, praying to God or whomever to grant me this. And the news were just bad. \n\nOn June 6th, late at night, we talked and he declared his love to me. Said, it was weird to fall for someone he's never met but I totally bewitched him. It's the first time I understood what butterflies in the stomach mean! It was a fluttering sensation. Exactly that. I swore to him I'll find a way to see him soon.\n\nA few weeks later I stumbled on a news article that there was a loophole in the border closures. I could go to the USA and quarantine on the way back but only by air. He couldn't come at all. It was terrifying. A gamble. What if I got stuck there and lost my job? What if? What if? I didn't know anyone who had flown internationally since.\n\nI booked  a flight to Newark on  August 8. The airport was so deserted, at some point it was only me and the janitor in the terminal. 5 flights would depart that day to the USA. Usually it's at least a 100.\n\nI landed in Newark, shaking, wondering. What is he like? I never felt this way about someone and I was 30. I have had many relationships. But this was different. I made it out of the terminal and waited, heart beating  for the black Honda Civic with New Jersey plates. He arrived and he was more handsome than on camera.\n\nWe spent an amazing and passionate 5 days together. Every second with him,  every touch, the weight of his arm around me while he slept, his soft breathing on my neck, every glance into his hazel eyes I branded into my memories for, if, life goes south for me, or I lose him,  I can remember these moments and know life was worth it. These memories were worth it.\n\nWe decided to brave the pandemic and travel to Europe. Serbia as it's one of the countries Americans were allowed to. And we both loved Roman archeology so this was the key of the trip. He organized it all. It was an amazing trip to a great country with great people.  They had no restrictions in October so i had forgotten the pandemic was a thing !\n\nWe returned and I saw him twice after that in 2020. We spent NYE in the USA with his friends. And then my govt announced that we needed to stay in quarantine hotels if we travel plus tons of tests... I was depressed for the first time in my life.  I just wanted to be with him and it's like the universe was conspiring against me...  I thought he would leave me because the whole thing was just so hard. He swore to me wouldn't. I offered to  apply for an invitation for compassionate grounds that would allow him to come as my boyfriend. He agreed to come for a month and we rented an airbnb as he's allergic to cats.\n\nOn day 2 here he proposed to me. I was in tears. I would be the wife of this amazing man! This prince charming whose pictures I look through when I'm sad... and now we've decided to elope\ud83e\udd70 I'll be going to the USA next month and cross the border by foot on the way back to avoid the quarantine hotels... and then our lives can finally begin.\n\nThank you for reading \ud83d\udc9b", "title": "A pandemic love story"}, {"created_utc": 1617795583, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mm04qs/i_asked_him_what_his_intentions_were_and_he_did/", "num_comments": 16, "score": 1, "selftext": "I met this guy few weeks ago and we went on a few dates together that went really well.

It was as I was in the final stages of my bachelor degree, and my dad had recently narrowly survived a cardiac arrest while we had been skiing together, so emotions were high at the time. I was beyond devastated. It was completely out of the blue, and right at a time where I really needed support. For six months, I cried and thought about little else. I then travelled solo overseas and that helped me take a big step forward. It was a year and a half after the breakup that I could truly say I was happy and had moved on. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t want to feel that feeling again; that soul-crushing heartbreak. That hindered me for some time while dating again. My standards were very high, as my last boyfriend truly was a wonderful person and I now have no hard feelings towards him. I was anxious when things started to progress and get more serious with someone I was dating, and I quickly wanted to establish something more exclusive and committed, because I didn\u2019t want to lose the person I was beginning to have feelings for, and feel anything close to that awful heartbreak again. My interest and eagerness to find commitment kept some men around for longer than they deserved, because they knew they could message me and I\u2019d welcome them back again and again. I wish I could have been stronger and seen that these men didn\u2019t value me the way I thought and the way I deserved. I\u2019d forgotten what that true respect and value felt like, and thought I was getting it, when I really wasn\u2019t. \n\n2020 gave me a needed break from dating and I finally got back on the apps over summer 20/21. I started talking to this kind, respectful guy who was interested in me as a person. We didn\u2019t talk for long before meeting up for a walk on the beach and a coffee. He was country Australian through and through, so down to earth, polite and talkative. After a month or so of talking and a couple of meetups that revolved around skateboarding, surfing and beach walks, I wondered if he was even interested because he had barely flirted or said anything even slightly suggestive. I was not used to this! But really he was just going at his own pace. We were developing a friendship that was fun, respectful and just thoroughly enjoyable. It was definitely a slow burn.\n\nSix months later and I\u2019ve fallen deeper in love than I could have imagined. We share so many interests and goals for the future, which I\u2019m stating to see materialise and fall into place before me. My parents adore him and so does my 92 year old Nan. I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s here to see me so happy with someone! He sees me completely for me and tells me he loves me multiple times every day. When I get up in the morning and stand naked before him with sleep in my eyes and my hair in a mess, he shakes his head in disbelief and says I\u2019m glowing and that I get more beautiful every day. I love his kindness and respect for every living thing around him. He\u2019s so capable, hard-working and inspiring. He can be a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is so gentle with me, with nature, and when discussing people\u2019s hardships and feelings. I feel so safe with and protected by him and yet he also makes me feel so strong, respected and independent. \n\nIt\u2019s just been so easy and straight forward. I\u2019ve never second guessed his true intentions, or felt insecure around him. He is honest and open with me and we communicate about everything no matter how insignificant it may seem at the time. It feels so right everyday and I am starting to feel like this is it! He\u2019s my person. He is so perfect for me and all I could ever hope for in a partner. I am just so happy and excited for the future! Our love is an absolute breeze. \n\nThank you for listening to me gush and gloat.", "title": "I\u2019m (27f) so in love, but for so long I couldn\u2019t imagine being here!"}, {"created_utc": 1631315856, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/plvzbc/oh_boy/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Oh boy."}, {"created_utc": 1631312042, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/plux1k/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I don\u2019t know what to do!"}, {"created_utc": 1631309686, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/plu7f5/i_catch_feelings_to_easily/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I catch feelings to easily..."}, {"created_utc": 1631309083, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/plu0wc/do_you_think_its_a_decision_to_fall_in_love/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Do you think it's a decision to fall in love?"}, {"created_utc": 1631307136, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/pltf9c/my_boyfriend_lets_me_gush_about_my_dreams/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "My boyfriend lets me gush about my dreams."}, {"created_utc": 1631306292, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/plt68a/idk_if_this_is_allowed/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Idk if this is allowed"}, {"created_utc": 1631305669, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/plszcy/why_the_fucc_are_we_so_far_apart/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Why the fUCC are we so far apart"}, {"created_utc": 1631303649, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/plsd3x/i_dont_know_if_a_girl_likes_me/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I don\u2019t know if a girl likes me"}, {"created_utc": 1631303371, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/pls9yk/im_deeply_in_love/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I'm deeply in love"}, {"created_utc": 1631298562, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/plqqvo/like_a_bird_like_a_sword_on_fire_a_hero_in_armor/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Like a bird, like a sword on fire, a hero in armor."}, {"created_utc": 1631290920, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ploc04/i_will_never_be_loved/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I will never be loved"}, {"created_utc": 1631289303, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/plnske/sometimes_they_make_you_feel_like_they_love_you/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "sometimes they make you feel like they love you and sometimes you are nothing to them!

This tale is not like other romances and may be seen as empty by some, but to me, it means the world and shaped the very person I am today, and unfortunately lives only as a ghost of a memory, or perhaps, a memory of a ghost. \n\nMy name is Revan Paris \u2013 currently twenty. I was ten at the time of this story, and still had much to learn and grow to be, however I was wise beyond my years and adult like in much of my action and thought. My life before and after this is a story all its own, from the years spent in isolation to others, to my frequent almost monthly moves from one city to another, to being raised and hunted in a dreamworld of nightmares, to my latter years after sixteen and the person I am today. However, my life was filled with loss and tragedy, and at the time this story begins I was living alone with my mother in Oregon. Most of my hours were spent alone, with my mom using her computer to study for her master\u2019s degree. I worked on homeschool in the morning and spent most of my time playing online games like Farmville. \n\nI found this old mmorpg, toontown and decided to join one day. It was pretty fun, and I spent many hours every day playing it. Though I knew it not at the time, a major aspect of my online personality was being formed at the time, and the person I am today on Swtor stems fully from this time. One of the aspects of the game was \u201cfriending\u201d other players and thus being able to know the person\u2019s in game location and chat with them anytime they are online \u2013 along with having them in your friend\u2019s list and being able to travel to their estate. After a month or two of playing I saw a higher up (better leveled) toon named felicity and I sent her a friend request, a common practice at the time since being friends with higher toons helps you advance faster in the game. Little did I know that simple act would define me for the rest of my life. \n\nHer in game name was Felicity and we started playing the game together, and after doing some game activities together a couple days later we began hanging out in game all the time. My characters name was Sir Comet Pumpkinswirl, and as you would expect my personality was about as crazy, wild, and interactive as my name was elaborate \u2013 and there was never a dull moment with me. I was fun and nice player. Felicity in contrast, was very quiet, kind, and caring. When she replied \u2013 she had a way of saying things in a way that would make you yearn for her next words. My heart would jump when she came online and would stop when waiting for her next reply. The greatest regret I have is losing most of the memories and conversations we shared together, but I will allow you to see what few memories I have left, of my first and only love of my life.\n\nFelicity originally had two friends she would hang out with a lot, maddy who I didn\u2019t really know, but after a month of playing with felicity I never saw again, and lynn her boyfriend, who I was jealous of because of how much they hung out together. Me and felicity would hang out as soon as she got online, and after playing all day we would travel to her or my estate at night at talk till she got offline, usually from 6pm to 10 or 11pm pacific standard time. Felicity and I agreed to be best friends when I asked her after playing together a couple months. A few weeks after we became best friends, I remember myself and felicity were playing in donalds docks when she asked me if I liked her saying she liked me and if we could be closer. I asked her what she meant, and she refused to tell me, and about twenty minutes later saying she \u201cliked liked me\u201d and wanted to be my girlfriend. At the time I was only ten so I was hesitant especially considering she would be my first girlfriend, but I said yes. From then on I would call her gf and we were closer than ever.\n\nI have explained the situation, but I have not told the person she was. I do not know the color of her hair, her age, not even her real name, but I will share with you the person I knew. Felicity was always kind and caring, she called me comet as a nickname and her sentences would be go \u201ccomet, really?\u201d or  something of the sort, but only at times \u2013 she would never overuse my nickname so much so that it would make my heart stop every time she did. if I did something that annoyed or flustered her a bit she would respond with \u201cCOMET!!!\u201d, it still makes me laugh to this day, I was always a bit crazy at times. She usually wore a black spiderweb shirt with a red bow and a heart-patch jean skirt with a backpack on her cat character in game. I remember once she let me dress her up\u2026. Only once though \u2013 Which knowing me I picked blue dragon wings, a fruit samba hat, alien bug eye glasses, and neon shoes\u2026.. She hated it but still wore it for me that day. We would duo hard tasks together and spend so much time every day. At night we would talk, and I would share my past and who I was, and she sometimes would tell me about herself. Her favorite book was Twilight and she liked snakes and spiders, which at the time I totally hated. Her favorite color was dark blue. She used to dream at night sometimes of sitting in a peaceful field under a big tree, I always wished I could find that field, dream of that tree and find her there. Her dream home was in the woods next to a waterfall with a window right above her bed so she could see the stars. She also wanted to work as a park ranger someday, maybe that is what she is doing this very day. \n\nFelicity had an impression of kindness, mystery, care, sweetness in every sentence she gave, she also took her time in responding, making you wait to hear her words. I jumped for joy every time she came online. She even created a non-cat toon \u2013 her only rabbit because she wanted to have one that matched mine as a gift to me \u2013 Daffodil Dandyswirl \u2013 her female companion to my toon. I also remember her other toon names, Melody Sparklebee and Io. She also had three doodles, Whatever (she picked this name because she told me she uses this phrase a lot which I found funny), Snowball (similar to my doodle Sapphire), and Luna. She was also very alluring in the way she said things, not flirtatious, but she had a way of saying things with a life in them that I have not seen from anyone else to this day, and Only two people I have known out of thousands I have talked to both irl and online have even come close. I was not the only one who saw this either, while she was my gf two dudes started hanging out with us a lot \u2013 jimmy kitty and jonathan which made me jealous, and for good reason because both of them wanted to be her bf as they admitted to me. I was always cordial though, but I did warn her about their intentions \u2013 but me and both of them agreed to let the best man win \u2013 and Felicity chose me. That being said they still tried to get with her any chance they could get, and part of me wonders if she actually cheated with them. \n\nI do not know much about felicity's home life, but she once told me something really horrific happened to her, she never revealed what it was. I do not remember if she said she loved me, or if I said I love her \u2013 perhaps it would hurt to much for me to remember, and ten years has passed since then and much of my memory has been lost from this time. Unfortunately, life has a way of ruining what is most precious. Because of my mom\u2019s separation, in order to survive she had to travel around the country repairing old houses for food and shelter, and thus, many of the places we lived in for a few weeks had no internet access. From felicities perspective, I would just vanish for weeks upon end and reappear and then stop playing for a while. This created distance between us and slowly she started drifting away. This hurt me a lot, because while I may have been just her online bf that would vanish for a couple weeks and come back on my side there was a different story. Every time I was in the car passengers side driving for hours upon end I would look up at the moon and think of her, when going to a motel I would rush to set up internet connection and go online just for the chance to see her, at night I would fall asleep thinking of her, and I would wait in agony for weeks just for the opportunity to talk to her again.\n\nA year or more passed, im not sure how long for certain. At this point in time me and felicity were still bf and gf, but she was distant no longer spending much time talking to me or together. I invited her to my estate and told her I was leaving toontown for good, but I gave her information about my online profile if she wanted to contact me irl, I then said goodbye and left her and toontown for good deleting my character and profile, in my heart I knew I would never hear from her again, and I never did. Some part of me must have shut down at that point, I felt nothing and went on life as normal.\n\nA couple years later I found out toontown shut down and a remake \u2013 toontown rewritten opened up. I searched for her name online tirelessly after that wanting to find her again. Eventually I pared her name with one of the dudes that was trying to get with her, and to my surprise he was looking for her too. I contacted him and we connected with shared intent to find her, I joined toontown rewritten and spent many hours for two months asking everyone I could see, much less toons resembling how she looked if they knew a toon named felicity. I never found her again, and eventually realized she was not to be found online in the game. Ten years later I have grown, gotten a job, known many people, had relations with other women, even a new best friend now, but sitting here alone I realize how truly special she was, and how she was the only person I ever loved. Ive tried to find her online but to no avail seeing as I do not even know her real name (although jimmy kitty told me she told him it was anne), her location, or any distinctive information about her. \n\nWhat is love, what does it take to truly love someone, must you be a certain age, connect in a certain way, know a person\u2019s facial features, live together, sleep together, \u2013 or perhaps is it something more, to connect with someone through the moments you share, the desires and dreams you entrust them, the way your heart jumps just by being able to see them and talk to them, finding yourself thinking and dreaming about them throughout the day and night, being willing to do anything to see them happy, and having who they were leave an impression and mark on you permanently? After knowing felicity, I began noticing in my online conversations and personality in Swtor over five years later a certain grace, care, and mystery resembling who she was during my conversations with others \u2013 and at the same time still having my crazy comet side, becoming a complimentary combination of felicity and comet in my online personality. I found this really intriguing, had she truly affected me so much that my personality morphed into someone partially resembling who she was? I learned many lessons from Felicity, I learned what grace meant, what it meant to love, I learned the lesson early on to never date online thus saving me from many disasters others my age and older had fallen into, and I learned to never love again, and how rare someone truly special was. \n\nFelicity, Ive loved you always, I am sorry I could not connect with you when I was young in the way I could now that I have grown, I hope your life is filled with happiness and joy. I wonder many a night if I was truly in love with who you were, or just who I thought you to be. As my memories fade it seems like only a ghost and recollection of a memory I used to have remain, or simply a faded memory of a ghost and enigma. I wish I could know who you are, the color of your hair, the glow of your eyes, the story of your life, what you dream of at night and aspire to be in life, who holds you at night and wipes away the tears when you cry, who you want to hold close by your side, and the person you have chosen to become in life.\n\nWas I truly in love with you, or was it my idea of you I was in love with? Either way I have never met anyone as special as you, nor have I cared about anyone like I cared about you.\n\nThe mention of your name rings like a Melody to my soul\n\nThe memory of your words Sparkles in my heart like the moon in the night\n\nThe moments we shared are more beautiful than a sea of Daffodils\n\nI lay under the stars in sheer Felicity dreaming of you\n\nWhat I would not give to see you, one last time\n\nTo Felicity, Always and Forever, Your Comet", "title": "My First Love, Felicity"}, {"created_utc": 1624747115, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/o8kpi5/what_is_the_difference_between_a_bad_and_toxic/", "num_comments": 8, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "What is the difference between a bad and toxic person/trait?

The story arc was them working together and falling in love, then falling out of love.\n\nThe writers introduced a temporary character, Kelsey Grammer as Frasier Crane, the new love interest for the Shelley Long character Diane Chambers.\n\nBehind the scenes, Shelley Long couldn't stand Kelsey Grammer. Since she had become a prima donna over the last few seasons, the producers decided to keep \"Frasier\" around longer than planned, just to spite her.\n\nEventually, Shelley Long became too big for her ego and left the show, convinced she was the next big thing in Hollywood.\n\nWe all know what happened next, her career fizzled out and she faded into obscurity like many others like her.\n\n Kelsey Grammer, kept on by the producers to spite Shelley Long, became a popular character and was made a regular. He wasn't without his own demons and issues, but he overcame them and today, has a successful career.\n\nAll because Shelley Long thought she could do better. \n\nRelationships are the same. Two people meet and fall in love. Well, one does anyway. The other sometimes does, other times plays along, not very comfortable with having someone love them. It's always them who then break things off, thinking they can do better than what they have.\n\nThat rarely works out. Grass is not greener. \n\nYes, I know there are **always** exceptions. But generally, the one who gets left behind eventually recovers and finds someone who this time, really REALLY appreciates them and treats them the way they deserve to be treated because of all the good their new partner brought into their life.\n\nThe one who thought they could do better? Once the initial fireworks of their new relationship fade away, they too fade into obscurity as they burn through one partner after another.

This was about a year and a half ago and it took me around 8 months to fully get over the relationship. Since then, I've noticed I'm much more cautious with getting to know people and dating. \nI figured the one way to truly get over someone is to start fresh and spend all of my money on phony dating apps full of people who really only want hookups (which is fine, but not when you aren't up front about it). I found myself going on dates with people who either made fun at my acne, body type, and pretty much anything I showed insecurities towards. I'd delete the dating apps after getting ghosted by (no joking here) ever guy I'd meet once or twice. I thought something was genuinely wrong with me. I asked my family if I talked too much or if I smelled bad lol. They always said I'm awesome just the way I am and it's really just a them problem. \nI decided to give the dating app, bumble, one last try. I ended up matching with a guy who looked way too pretty to be interested in me. I figured I may as well spark up a conversation with him anyways. At this point I've given up on the goal of finding a boyfriend and turned it into finding someone cool to talk to. We ended up having amazing, goofy, and deep conversations. And, for the first time, he asked me first to meet. \nWhen we met, it felt like we already knew one another. We both were nervous and it felt like that awkwardness you'd get in grade school when your crush would talk to you. It was so fun and refreshing.... Until, I started to overthink. \nWe'd always go on adventures and do something really fun. We'd hang out for 8 hours and still not want to leave each other. Not once did I let him know how I really felt- I fear coming off too strong. No offense, but guys tend to not like confrontation/ 'moving fast'. It all felt smooth like butter- not forced one bit. \nSuddenly, things changed. We haven't seen each other in a couple months due to the both of us traveling/going on vacation for the summer. I was honestly really enjoying just texting him a couple times a week, just checking in. I liked having that break to bring my focus back to myself and my personal values. I'm on vacation in Mexico atm and now that I know he's back in town and my trip is coming to an end, I'm feeling very unsure and anxious about the whole thing. I fear that after all this time hanging out won't be the same. Maybe he's found someone else he prefers more. It took me three months just for me to give him my snap chat. I'm being more careful than ever. \nNow I'm here, laying in bed, feeling like unadding him on Snapchat and muting his number because I'm terrified of losing again. He's too good to be true. \nAll I wanna know is if this has ever happened to you or if you have any input on the situation. I imagine any comments will just say I'm over thinking. It's also been a pattern that as soon as I get close with someone, the ghost me. If he ghosts me, frankly, I'm going to give up on trying to find new romantic interests. \nThanks for reading.", "title": "Do you ever feel like letting go of someone before committing to avoid getting hurt?"}, {"created_utc": 1624590229, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/o7f31j/weird/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "weird"}, {"created_utc": 1624589802, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/o7eypx/deprived/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Deprived"}, {"created_utc": 1624589615, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/o7ewzo/we_had_a_nice_impromptu_date_today/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "We had a nice impromptu date today."}, {"created_utc": 1624587072, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/o7e7tr/not_sure_what_i_am_feeling_or_whats_going_on/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Not sure what i am feeling or whats going on.

Just wanted to share my story.  To start it off, a lil about me (M/44).  Im an introvert, shy, stoner, loner, done with heartbreak hurt of relationships, dont want marraige type guy.  I keep my friend circles small.  Gaming and streaming television are pretty much all I do when I am not working or have my children (2 from past relationships).\n\nThis past late November, browsing through some dating app checking out profiles.  And I get a message from (F/37), I know a guy getting messaged by someone?  And it stated \"You look familiar.\"  She did not look familiar to me however.  We started chatting...and things clicked that first night more than ive ever felt with anyone else.  She tells me pretty fast that the picture on her profile was fake and she did so due to what she does for a living and didnt want personal info coming into the wrong people.  She sends me a real pic...beautiful woman, but still doesnt look familiar.  We talked well into the next morning.  I fell in love with this girl that night...more than I ever could percieve possible.  She says the same.  \n\nDuring our first conversation, we added each other on facebook.  And there it was...she saw me enough on her exes (M/41) friends list.  Mind you its been probably a good 10 or so years since I last physically saw this person, and what could be considered a good close friend back in that era.  But it was a few months since they broke up and she didnt deem it a problem.  Now her ex..is also what you could consider a piece of dog poo.  Habitual liar, cheater, drunk, anger issues, but somehow has the ability to sweet talk females.  The reason why they broke up were for those reasons.  Only reason he was a friend in the past was he was part of a circle of friends i fell into.\n\nBack to me and the girl...we texted consistantly for about a week.  And there was no doubt we felt only what we could describe a magnetic attraction pulling us together.  It wasnt long before our first meeting.  And yes, it was magical.  Best night of my life at that point.  Theres nothing comparable to the feelings we had for each other at this point.  Like if past lives were a thing...weve been together every incarnation.  It was also that night we became official.  A week or two passed, and things just got better and more intense.\n\nAs with most nice guys that get effed over...i made the biggest mistake of my life not knowing what the chain reaction that was ahead.  I was like...im going to get a hold of ex and try to be respectful and make it seem it was intentional or that we were trying to hide it.  He seems cool and is all like yeah you guys would seem perfect for each other and he reaches out to her and tell her the same.  That didnt last long.  He kept getting in contact with her and manipulated his way back in somehow.\n\nOne night after getting son from out of town, i let her know I was home safe (we didnt live together).  And i get a text \"im sorry\" and am immediately blocked.  I was so confused.  Until a few minutes later i get a message from ex saying yeah they got back together.  The hurt i had that day, and the proceeding month or so, if i didnt have my child, i wouldnt be here today.\n\nFast forward a month or so, we are about at the end of January now, and she messages me...how sorry she was, and how he got controlling right off the bat and wouldnt let her get a hold of me at all, but still wanted to be friends, she still wants me in her life and stuff.  Come to find out he lied to her and told her i was a big meth junkie (i am a heavy marijuana smoker...but thats it), went and told other mutual friends we had/have that i thought they were all pieces of dog poo, dude tried to ruin my life.\n\nIt wasnt long for that attraction to boot right back up, and we decided to get back together around valentines day, regardless that she has not broken up with ex yet...but she will \"soon\".  But she, she has effin heart of gold, and despite his \"habits\" hes still doing she had a hard time doing it.  I tried to be understanding and told her im not going anywhere.  It took way longer than it should have...maintaining that kind of relationship hiding it from people mainly the ex, too put it lightly a little stressful.  A few times i was fed up with it and did leave only to keep finding ourselves being fately attracted together.  But i know this girl is for me, i never cared for marraige...wasnt a life goal of mine.  Until her.\n\n3 days ago, she finally did it, and its so great to feel open with freedom and back on track again with my best friend, my lover, and my soul mate.  We dont keep secrets from each other no matter how damning.  We have never lied to each other and our love still continued to grow throughout our experience.  I could never feel for someone else as I do her.  Im glad I kept the strength and patience to pull through months of this.  We have total trust and loyalty despite this speed bump.  I am going to marry her.  Marraige is a life goal now.  Thank you anyone who read this far...for reasons obvious...i cant share this story with personal people, but felt the need to share it.\n\nTL/DR - Stuck through with my girlfriend through a pretty preventative speed bump on our love life.", "title": "My story of my soul mate."}, {"created_utc": 1624564939, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/o78so6/nothing_\u4e00/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Nothing \u4e00"}, {"created_utc": 1624563958, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/o78gmy/things_were_great_where_did_we_go_wrong/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Things were great, where did we go wrong?"}, {"created_utc": 1624563796, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/o78ekc/saying_i_love_you_in_a_situationship/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Saying I love you in a situationship"}, {"created_utc": 1624563371, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/o789gm/cant_be_together_because_of_her_family/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "can\u2019t be together because of her family"}, {"created_utc": 1644862308, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ssh6of/change/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Change"}, {"created_utc": 1644860378, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ssgdpy/happy_vd_everybunny/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Happy VD Everybunny!"}, {"created_utc": 1644860161, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ssgakc/for_all_of_my_fellow_singles_today_on_valentines/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "For all of my fellow singles today on Valentine\u2019s Day"}, {"created_utc": 1644859914, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ssg71b/how_does_it_feels_to_be_loved/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "How does it feels to be loved?"}, {"created_utc": 1644859474, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ssg0ky/i_mightve_fallen_in_love_with_a_girl_i_probably/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I might\u2019ve fallen in love with a girl i (probably) will never meet again"}, {"created_utc": 1644857855, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ssfckc/i_fell_in_love_with_a_girl_that_i_probably_never/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I fell in love with a girl that I probably never meet again"}, {"created_utc": 1644857090, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ssf1df/valentines_day_music/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Valentine\u2019s Day Music"}, {"created_utc": 1644856925, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/sseyyq/i_really_want_a_partner_so_i_think_i_should_stay/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I really want a partner so I think I should stay single for a bit"}, {"created_utc": 1644855995, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/sselqu/we_build_playlists_together_this_weeks_theme/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "We build playlists together.

I started noticing that she stares at me and when we talk she keeps up this gaze as if she wants me dead lmao but I thought it's pretty normal to maintain eye contact while talking to a person so I didn't give it much thought. A few weeks go by and I started noticing that she looks at me from afar and when I catch her looking she maintains eye contact. This one time she just decided to come to my isle, stare and maintain eye contact for like 5 seconds and just leave. We have to wear masks at all times so it's very hard to figure her out. To point out another thing, she also kinda lurks around to where I would normally be. Another time when I was about to enter my workplace, I kinda bumped into her since I didn't see her walking towards me and we both startled each other. We said hi and all and she checked me out looking top to bottom and just walked away. Getting very mixed vibes from her.

We start dating LDR an year later, it start a bit wonky cause we dont talk much or do much at first? Weirdly enough how we survived that phase for the whole month. Then me and her kept asking how our was our day every single day even tho there is nothing to talk about we just make up nonsense situation and what you gonna do in that situation.\n\nA few months passed... I didnt know i can fell in love this deep but i just did and i swore i will marry this girl at that moment, i want to make her the most happiest women in my life and do everything i can to puts smiles on her face. Just heard her opinion and inputs about my days and my make up situations. I can tell she is caring, kind, smart women and also well manners to the point its cutely innocent? (I have that feelings to corrupts that innocent but oh boy it took me like 2 years worth of relationship for her mind to being *slightly* corrupted so she can stop being so cutely dense and take a hint that i also want us to have naughty moment)\n\nAnd since its LDR, my craves to interact with her irl is just getting bigger and bigger. I started to make a list of what i want to do with her...all sorts stuff from trivial stuff cuddling in couch while watching tv, whispering my love to her ears every now and then to the most romantic cheesy stuff i can think of, climbs ontop of mountain with her and brags how lucky i am to have her to the world, crying together with her when she finally pregnant with our first child. Every time i have this long feeling for her i always hit her dm and tell everything about it. Shit i never call someone dear or darling back then cause it was so cringe to me but with her if she want me to start calling with the cringiest nickname i would gladly call her that every single time we are together without faze even we are in public. She changed me...in more ways than i expected for better. \n\nBut after 2 years, she stop texting me for a whole month(we never stop contact like that without any prior notice) and i got worried like really worried to what happened to her then her cousin told me that her family finally caught our relationship. Maybe i was super positive and decisive i thought i can finally talks to her family and tell them my true intentions that is to marry her in the future...but her parents doesnt want me as son in law because 1st they dont her to stay away from the family(even tho im willing to move to their country if thats what it take for us to get marry) 2nd because we are different in racial so they dont want to mix it. I tried and tried to convince her family and they kept rejected me again and again then tell me to break off our relationship. I was mad, im mad that relationship that i spent 2 years on is gonna end and they dont see my resolution to see this relationship through to marriages and die old(which understandable cause they barely know me and she never mentions me in her family except for cousins) \n\nAfter that we finally can talk again but for a brief...sorting out our feelings for each other and she wants us to breaks this relationship (oh i tried to changes her mind so hard in that brief moment but for her, her family comes first) i was disheartened and disbelief beyond words even now i wish i could try harder back then to convince her family or her or maybe made her falls in love with me more. I love her man i really do and i really wish i can have her as my wife and die old with her but seen how she unfaltering to my words and decisive with this breakup. I cant do anything but give in, it felt like i was moving a mountain then accepts the fact i cant move that mountain and that moment i learned what hopeless feels like. So we broke up but still stay in touch with each other(tho its super rare) maybe because i need to sorts my feelings and calm myself down to accepts the fact we cant be together till we both die old\n\nIts honestly not a really bad break up but its...hard to erased her in my heart like every wall and space inside my heart is being nailed down all about her and each time i want to remove something about her i feels like i lost a bit of me. Even almost 2 years i still love her so much but it doesnt feels that much painful that knowing i cant stay together with her forever. Now im 22 and shes 20 and what i can tell she is living her life...maybe i havent talk much with her nor her cousin keep me update about her life\n\nI think i should stop for now feels like im just digging out lovely memories that gonna make me more sad later and thanks for those who read this far and im sorry for ruined this wholesome vibe that you all having but i hope you can your significant other and stay forever .

Just see how wrong assumptions you have towards life. Your happiness is completely depend upon others. You are just 20 so calm down because there is a time for everything in life. You will get it don't worry, but let the time come. Don't run for that. You will get your bf, you will also fall in love, you will have sex in ur life, you will get married, you will have kids.

He can barely stand to make it from the bed to the front door to sit outside. But he's had more energy today! \u2764 I'm so hopeful and happy that he is more energetic than he has been in a long time. I missed him and his smile and light so terribly.\n\nYesterday he opened his eyes to tell me I was moving too much and I stopped mid sentence. His eyes stun me they're so beautiful. A cool green sometimes, with nothing but green, and then sometimes they have thins golden brown color that pops out around the pupil. Absolutely breathtaking. I fall in love with him all over again just by making eye contact sometimes. And it's not even a shallow looks thing (I mean of you ask me, he's gorgeous), but more of a wow please stay with me forever bcs I love your soul type thing.\n\nWe've talked about marriage a bit. We definitely want a baby. We were trying a lot before he got so miserably sick. Hes the love of my life.\n\nBefore I was with him, my apartment was just a box that held me and cooled me from the heat of the day. Now it's a home. Now I'm proud of what I have and how I can take care of him and his kiddos. I can't wait for the future when we really get back on our feet and start making plans for life together.\n\nI'm so absolutely in love with this man. I never realized it could be this way. I can barely say no to him or be mad at him. He's so sweet and cute. I hate when I have a bad mental health day, because I never want to be anything but completely there for him. But he's there for me, listens and comes to my aid when he can tell I'm not ok. Gah once he's well enough, I can't wait to please him any way he wants.\n\nEarlier I felt a little past the elastic on his pants on his hip and he told me not to be handsy. I immediately stopped and apologized and promised not to again. Honestly I knew not to, it was more of a reflex. I did not want anything or expect anything. Nor was it on my mind to even try! But it was so absolutely cute and sincerely made me smile that he told me not to for some reason. I just melted inside.\n\nOf course he wasn't upset in the least, but the idea that there is going to be anticipation and complete and utter respect from me towards him regarding touching him and sex really did it for me for some reason.. I can't wait to rock his world after he feels well enough. And we both tested positive for covid, so we are quarantined together. \ud83e\udd70 I'm so happy to be taking care of him, and I think he's getting better!!!\n\nI'm so absolutely in love with him. I wish I had money so I could give him and his daughters whatever and everything. Otherwise they have my heart fully forever. He's my soulmate. He told me once he'd lay on glass for me.

(I hate him that much). \n\nSurprisingly he got little smart in studies and sorted out his anger issues in 2 years period, he seemed a changed man. One day someone tapped the door and mom asked me to see who it is. I opened and surprised to see him outside. He said hey. I said hey. He said, \"hmm, is my sister here?\". I said \"No, I'll let you know if she comes here\". (That's our first conversation). I closed the door in haste. And after two days, he called me when i was about to enter the library. I asked what?. He said, \"are you? I mean my sister asked you to call her later in the evening\". He ran away saying this. I was like whatever. \nLater that evening I called my friend, she said (spilled) the truth that he likes me. I was like what? That creature? \n\nShe defended her brother and said he is scared and intimidated by you. He's very nervous to ask you out. He never asked anyone out. Just go out with him one time. If you don't like him, I'll tell him to back off. After some arguments, i said, \"I'll go out with him only if he asks me out, not you but he should ask me out\". We striked a deal. \n\nThen the next day, he came before me when i was about to leave to school. He was like, hey. I said hey. He said hey again. I said hey. He said i want.. you to. I called my sister and said let's go to school it's getting late. He didn't even tried to call me as i was leaving in front of his eyes. Then for next 2 months all i did was haunt him and raise my voice a little when he was about to ask me out. In those 2 months i really enjoyed watching him beat himself up to ask me out and kinda sad as he messed up again. My fav pass time in those two months is to see him playing with his dog and see him exercise and listen from my friend about how he is practicing to ask me out. Without me knowing all i was expecting everyday is when and how he's gonna come and ask me out. Basically, i was thinking about him all day. I even started saying no to other guys. My thought was if he sees me going out with another guy, he will not ask me out.  After 2 months of waiting. I asked him out. (Well, i Messed him up big time, he really deserved this). \n\nWe went on our first date. Our first date was just walking in the park, talking for one hour and had dinner.  Nothing else. He was really funny and charming. I never saw this side of him. And i like him giving attention to details. And then we went on another date and another. After two months and odd of dating he finally said, \"I love you so much\". Finally. I gently kissed him and said me too. It's been 28 years since that day. That day we lost our virginity too. (I always wanted to give mine to the right guy. I felt like I can never find another like him). \n\nThe next three years went like anything. Schools over, college, going out, lots of late night stays those were the best years of us . At 19 he proposed me out of nowhere. Before my brain finish thinking about anything, my mouth said yes instantly. There was no second thought from me. And after few months we got married. I was already pregnant at that time. And later we had 3 more kids. Now all 4 kids are grown up and living their life happily. And we have a grandson. \n\nYesterday we were talking about all this. His sister/my best friend and sis in law revealed the secret that after trying himself to ask you out and failed. He literally begged her to set us up. He know that I was her best friend. I may go out with him if she recommends him. She said\" 'that day after he messed up at the library he came to me and said, I see a future with this girl. If you don't act on it,  i may miss her. If things didn't work out I'm okay with it. If I miss her now i may regret that later in life. But I'm very confident that I'll get her if she go out with me. She will be your sister in law. I promise you that.\"  Seeing his madness, she set us up. So she is the cupid in our story. \n\nLooking back in my life. I fell for him without me even realising. The man I hated the most as a kid is my love of my life now. Life have tons of funny twists. He was right, i went out with him and he got me in the first date. I was happy my whole life. Yeah we had our bad days, financial tightness (4 kids, having kids is fun but raising them is very difficult we learned that the hard way), and we had fights and struggles but he was there for me all the time and I was there for him all the time. I can't find a better husband, friend for me and a better dad for my kids than him. Ahh, i love him so much!

Since your father passed away. Since your birthday.\n\nYou  may never know the impact you have had on my life. I don't believe I  fully understand it either. But maybe one day I'll try to tell you.\n\nThe  ways I pushed myself to be more like you. More free, more involved in  life, more devoted to community. Well I quit that job I didn't like. You  sure did inspire me to follow my heart.  And I said screw it to that  lease I didn't want to sign and did the van life for a bit. The road  trips I went on. The places I experienced, the music I played. The  rainbows I saw. I would be lying if I said your way of being didn't  inspire me.\n\nI put my blood sweat  and tears into creating a life I love. In some sort of divinely  orchestrated way you seem to be the epicenter of that change. The change  I was crying out for and happened within a years time. You are the  beautiful and free human who made me change the way I saw the world- the  way I re-aligned what my priorities were. Suddenly community and  friendship sky rocketed to the top of my list. And I found myself asking  myself, \"What will I remember as the most fulfilling parts in life when  I am lying on my death bed?\" And I found myself over and over again at  one answer: \"The relationships I create with the people I love\".\n\nYou  played your divine role well. You were a beacon of light in my once  dark world- showing me that there was a world beyond media screens and  tv news stations. You brought me back to the simple pleasures of  sunshine and trees, of time with friends and singing without a reason.  Of making tea to get the day started and breathing deep just because it  feels good.\n\nNo, we didn't fall in  love- no matter how much I wished it were so. I didn't get to hold you  and wipe your tears. We didn't spend hours exchanging silly ideas and  music, tangled up in one another's arms. No- you had bigger things to  teach me. About how love can mean more than romance. And sometimes space  isn't personal. How I don't know what people are thinking and I can't  guess. The best I can do is live my life to the fullest and hope I catch  a glimpse of that goofy smile of yours from time to time. And even  though our moments together are short and fleeting- you're still in my  life. I know that you are alive and breathing and existing. And just  knowing humans like you exist is good enough. Because true love doesn't  expect anything or feel owed anything. True love just says \"Thank you  for existing. That is good enough for me.\"\n\nHappy  Birthday dear one. Thankful to be apart of your life. Thank you for  your sweet lesson. When you look at me I know -though the timing is  wrong- the love is there. You make me realize that some people, just by  existing, can impact our lives in unspeakable ways.

We never forgot about each other and somehow we managed to come back after some time apart. It was tough, because I was missing him every day and every night. We started talking again few weeks ago. I told him how I feel and that I really want him to be by my side, and he told me he wants the same. I was so happy, cause I waited almost 6 months to hear from him that he actually care about me the way I do. He's literally the best thing that ever happened to me. \n\nWe met for the first time yesterday, because we are living about 2h of drive from each other. After almost a half of the year since we met. I cannot explain how stressed, miserable, scared and thrilled I was - I were overthinking every single thing about that day: what should I wear, where should I take him, how should I act. But, I was also so happy and excited at the same time. I even got sick for a moment because of all that emotions, you know.\n\nAnd finally that day came. He was even better, even more handsome and sweet than I expected him to be. I was over the moon all day. We even got many, many sweet situations together, like imagine: we were waiting for the bus, while I suddenly felt that I want to pat his head. And, apparently, he wanted to do the same at the same time!We both laughed and said \"I'm sorry!\". Then, I said that maybe we have connected minds; I asked him to play rock paper scissors to figure out if its true or not. We both showed scissors and laughed so hard, people were staring at us.

I\u2019ve seen couples I know wish they had never ever met eachother, and all that pain, comes from love.\nLove can be scary, love can be amazing, love can bring hope, and love can bring you down.

I\u2019ve had a crush on a girl and we\u2019ve talked a bunch, I realized that we have completely different life goals and priorities, and that even if we did end up getting in a relationship, one of us would have to give up their dreams in the long term. So I\u2019ve decided to move on and it\u2019s been hard.\n\nSo while trying (and failing) to fall asleep over the past couple months I\u2019ve given a lot of thought to what love is, both to differentiate between a crush and real love and to get my mind of real life, and I would like to quickly outline some of the main conclusions I\u2019ve come to about what I think love is.\n\nJust a warning, I am Christian so I will reference the Bible, I am not trying to force anything upon you, I\u2019m just using the Bible as a reference. I respect everyone\u2019s choice to not believe and I just ask that you respect my choice in return.\n\nSo first of all, I think that love is more than an emotion, I think that it\u2019s a rational choice that you need to make every day. In the book of Hosea, God tells Hosea to buy a prostitute as his wife, and tells him to love her, even though she didn\u2019t love him and loved the lifestyle of being a prostitute.\n\nNow this of course isn\u2019t a healthy relationship, but when you and your so fight, why do you come back to them? Why is it that the next morning, you\u2019re able to wake up and give them a hug? Why is it that even when you\u2019re fighting and almost going at each other throats you know not to cross certain lines and you know that in a day or two all will be forgotten?\n\nEven if you rationally don\u2019t realize it, your subconscious made the decision to love that person.\n\nIt\u2019s not about physical looks, or about lust or the \u201cbutterflies\u201d you feel in your stomach. These things might be the things that start a relationship, and eventually they will be the result of that decision to love the other person.\n\nPer example, there are several examples of people that started dating because they found each other attractive, but after a few years one of them let themselves go, gained weight, got in an accident and got scars, or any other situation where someone becomes conventionally unattractive. But their so still loves them, and if you ask them they will say that said person is the most beautiful person in the world. Their relationship started because they found each other attractive, but now they find each other attractive because of their love for each other.\n\nWhy is that? It\u2019s because of that choice you made to love the other person.\n\nWe can also see this in more negative examples, why do we have so many cases where a woman stays with an abusive and cheating man? Or where a man stays with a manipulative and abusive woman? It\u2019s because they made the choice to love the other person, it\u2019s an unhealthy choice but it\u2019s a choice so powerful that it defies reason, the saying \u201clove blinds\u201d exists for a reason. The person being abused genuinely loves their abuser. They love them to the point where they don\u2019t realize that the abuser doesn\u2019t love them back.\n\nI\u2019ve read a lot of posts in this subreddit, and a lot of gushing posts say things along the lines of \u201che\u2019s the perfect man\u201d or \u201cshe has no flaws\u201d. And I can guarantee you two things, the person writing that 100% believes what they are saying and that the person they are writing this about does have flaws. But the fact that they have flaws doesn\u2019t matter. Because if they both made the decision to love each other they will put their own happiness aside and work on those flaws. Even if it means sleeping less, or stoping eating a certain food they love, or getting rid of that bad habit of chewing with their mouth open.\n\nIn first Corinthians 13 we can read the following, \u201cLove is patient, Love is kind. Love is not boastful or envious or arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things\u201d\n\nHow can something endure all things if it\u2019s based in emotion? How can something be patient if it\u2019s based on emotion? How can something put itself aside and prioritize someone else if it\u2019s based purely on emotion?\n\nIn my opinion love isn\u2019t simply an emotion. Emotions do have a big part to play in love, but it\u2019s much more than that. Emotions are relative, a moment of pure happiness can seem gloomy from the middle of a depressive episode, a moment of pure terror can seem funny after the fact. Love isn\u2019t influenced by your emotions in the moment, it can be felt more strongly, or it can be felt more weakly, but the amount of love you feel towards someone else should not change wether you are fighting with someone or if your cuddling with them. You will feel love differently in those moments, but you will still love the person in the same way. If love was purely emotional you wouldn\u2019t put your partners life before your own, you wouldn\u2019t go hungry to see them eat, you wouldn\u2019t stop in the middle of sex to comfort them because they had a traumatic flashback. If love was an emotion, other emotions would be able to overpower it in specific moments.\n\nThese are just my two cents, coming from someone who has never felt true romantic love and is autistic. But from a purely theoretical point of view this makes sense to me.

Waiting 27 years to experience an intimate first kiss was long stretch but it didn't end there. I was loosing hope of a future worth living, just lost and feeling worthless. Thankfully, I crashed my motorcycle, effectively waking up my unconscious mind. Differentiating the divide between good and evil. I fell in love with life and learned through its single path how words and information travel but also the level of honesty in which people speak. Most of the time, its time spent meandering around the discomforting unknowns. Does he/she like me, am I going to fail them? What if this or that. I have a truckload of reasons to have what ifs, however, after my motorcycle accident, I learned something about myself. The lesser I spoke forthrightly about what I was looking for, the faster I was falling towards hell. Instead of my voice and narrative, people felt the need to fill in my blanks. Probably why a rapist was the one who'd spread a lie about me; my silence and patience when I fell is what let the devil exist. In her nativity, I was too complex (her words). Why was it so hard to admit I wasn't looking for the simple answers. A simple one night stand wasn't an aiming point of mine.\n\nTime, for me, froze the day I gave that girl a handshake. Teaching me everything I'd ever needed to know. So as path-ill-logical as I am, I'd spent the last year constantly fighting the emotions off from what happened after I crashed. Relationships were off my mind for once simply because I'd found what I was looking for. In a blink, I look back, 2021 seems something of a singularity to me. Sure, some memories are there, but it's definitely not the same as it use to be.\n\nThe day I met that girl, I finally understood what simple little things could make the years of suffering have something of a silver lining. Like randomly meeting a girl and quietly playing pool together. It helps when she gives you that look. By God, it felt like it was God looking at me through her eyes. I wanted nothing more than to bottle up the feeling I had that night and to have it last a lifetime.\n\nI started working again but, mind you, it's the least amount of responsibility possible. Finally working, time would just vanish. Spending most of my time still processing what'd happened. The friends I'd lost the people that betrayed, the girl that ran. It was all a blur. Finally, I could work like a good programmed human being would do. Being subservient and quiet, just a drone.\n\nCo-workers and I were downstairs. As I'm standing hanging out with a few people, a friend says, \"you two would be a cute couple\". In light of the girl I was standing next to. Didn't really pick up on it. Upstairs, I race to the phone to change the song that's playing and she meets me half way. As we stood not a millimeter apart, another friend said the same exact phrase to me, \"You two would be a really cute couple.\" We mutually pick The Weeknd as I then give me friend the look, like unlocking the flood gates, time started slowing down again. When 21 sped by at the speed of light, hearing that, my mind could finally be free from old idea's. At least she's caught on to the fact that I'm addicted to coffee; ensuring it's always full when I arrive. Or her comment on how my hair reminded her of the grease movie, (could be either a good or a bad thing).\n\nSitting down, writing the pages of my book. She touches my computer, \"what are you doing?\" As I write about my deep past. In the pages I have written, it's nearest to a full confessional of my self-perceived insecurities. How much I'd yearned for a mutual love when I realized, what I really needed was self-love. Fortunately, in order for me to discover what was bound to my heart, I had to be scared to death. Through it, I became far more confident but, to me, I feel just catatonic.\n\nWhat do I really want? 100% honesty. A bottle of wine as I talk about what'd happened after my accident. What I'd learned from it that quite literally explained the whole of humanity. All starting with one simple last name, Aspergers. So now that I've discovered the answer, I long for the day I can get lost in someone else's eyes. Preferably for the rest of my time but I'm fine if it's only for a moment. So long as it's love I feel. Nothing toxic, just a mutual love that can't be ruined by wrongful or grandiose expectations. However, if there's one thing I know, intimacy is a real drug. Feeding life into my bloodstream, burning lines through my limbs. Keeping me alive for that one morning I might wake up to a woman right besides me.\n\nThis hopeful romantic will not die without a fight.\n\nToo much of life comes between what drives us, love.

Boxing with each other and teaching them how to use throwing knives and pick locks, not for nefarious reasons, but because it's fun. Going to thrift stores and antique stores and flea markets and getting all of the cheap cursed objects we could find. Reading to them at night when they don't feel good. Singing to them. Taking showers together. Having a lazy day and lounging in bed with them. Making silly little jokes and giggling to each other, poking fun. Taking them places, going on trips, going out with them every weekend, doing something different and new, planning out future vacations in meticulous detail, even if they never happen. Never getting bored with them. Growing with them. Telling them how beautiful they are, every day, and telling them how much I love them, every day, and being close to them, every day.

I only met her online and that time I was having commitment issues, been flirting with a lot of girls so you can really say I was an asshole tho I don't get into relationship with girls I still break their heart for giving them false hopes. I've had red flags before, but this girl of mine chose to see the beauty in me. She didn't flirt with me tho cause she knows I'm a heartbreaker, we started being friends and got really close with each other, for some reasons I got comfortable and started telling her my problems (which I can't do with the other girls I know), fast forward, January this year we both had a crush on each other but only last til the 20th since she told me she can't settle without label relationships and I can't commit just yet into a relationship so we parted our ways. February 2nd, we started talking again and eventually started dating on the 13th, I took the risk with her since I really love her and I am willing to take the risk with her. Our first month wasn't really great cause we weren't that open with each other just yet, there were also doubts between us but we were able to fix it when we celebrated our first month being together and since then I've been the luckiest guy ever! She's the best, she has humor, she's intelligent, she has a heart for everyone she cares for everyone and she cares about the government (unlike some other teenagers). She thinks fairly and literally brought out the best in me! I have never ever felt this love and appreciation ever before, I literally got over my commitment issues and now I have no fear anymore, I'm more than willing to take risks for her, for us. She motivates and inspires someone like me who feels like there's no hope for me anymore. She also understands me and oh she researched for my disorders just for her to be able to understand me (I have depression and anxiety), just wow I can't stress enough how lucky I am to have her. Every month on the 13th we celebrate our special day together, we get on call and wait for exactly 12 am and greet each other also we give surprises for each other, sounds tiring for the others, it is but it just feels so great that someone loves you the way you love them. Since I met her, love has always been the greatest for me. She's also the type of girl who doesn't take my personal time from me, she lets me do anything I want whenever I want as long as I don't forget about her or about taking care of myself. I was really overwhelmed with the fact that I just finished playing my favorite game for almost an hour without me getting worried that someone might get mad (cause it has always been like that with the other girls I used to date) and it just felt so great, I have a partner but I still have my freedom. We've just started, it may seem like we haven't been into fights or misunderstandings or whatever problem couples may have, we've been there we've been through a lot and we both know that we'll be facing a lot more in the future, but we always make sure that whatever problem we will face, we'll get over them together and fix them together and also we never forget to give assurances to each other.

I\u2019ve known him since I was 16.\n\nWhen I was with my last bf, I never told anyone what he did to me. The things he said to break me down, the lies, the fights -physical and not-, I never told anyone of the sexual abuse or the pain he caused. 2 years, 2 years of dealing with that on my shoulders by myself. That was until I finally starting seeing friend\u2019s again, and slowly I opened up. And they helped me realize the resentment and pain and sadness I had wasn\u2019t all in my head. They helped me build the courage to leave, because I was so afraid of my ex hurting me or himself over it. \n\nWhen I left him, I really thought I\u2019d never find someone to love me or treat me properly. Because my ex truly made me believe no one would want me. I felt that I\u2019d never find a person who wouldn\u2019t hurt me, who wouldn\u2019t lie, who wouldn\u2019t assault me, but then my current bf was there for me. \n\nI started seeing my current bf shortly after breaking up with my ex. Not as a bf, but I craved intimacy, and he gave me that and a wonderful friendship. We spent as much time together as possible, laughing, crying, opening up in a way we never have through the years we have known eachother. He helped me not blame myself for what happened in the past with my ex, and he made me feel good about myself. \n\nHe told me I was pretty, beautiful, special, amazing. And found small things about myself that he found wonderful that I\u2019d always looked over. He helped me find beauty in the parts of myself that my ex broke down, and belittled. Our friendship grew so much, and my confidence and happiness grew with it too. \n\nOur friendship slowly went from friends to something more. Developed into hand holding, kissing, dates and cuddles. Something I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to do again... And then he asked me out, and when I said I needed time to heal some more, he gave me that time ! He respected my wishes to take it slow, and we did. We took it slow, and we are now officially dating. And it\u2019s wonderful. \n\nSo many will say it\u2019s too soon to be with someone after a long term relationship, that it\u2019s a rebound or who knows. But this feels right. I feel happy. I feel understood. I feel respected. Respected for the first time in 2 years. I spent 2 years convincing myself the pain was love, but now I\u2019ve found something that genuinely feels like what those 2 years should\u2019ve felt like... \n\nIt\u2019s soon, and it\u2019s a fresh relationship, but I feel so happy. So for you people that were like me, afraid of love because of what another has done to you. You deserve to have love. You do. \n\nAnd if any of you are in an unhealthy relationship, I know it\u2019s hard to leave, trust me... it\u2019s so scary. But please, do what\u2019s best for yourself. You\u2019re lovable... you\u2019re amazing... you\u2019re beautiful. You shouldn\u2019t have to ask someone to see that about you. You will find someone who genuinely treats you right, I promise. \n\nI just wanted to let my feelings out, but I just wanna say again, I\u2019m so happy.

A dreamer. A kid that believed Santa was real, the tooth fairy wasn\u2019t a lie, a kid that thought dragons hid in forests and unicorns flew above, a kid that would read about princesses in castles and the princes that would rescue them, a kid that believed in the phrase \u201chappily forever after\u201d. However, as time passed life began to show its true form to the boy, it showed him that life wasn\u2019t all unicorns and rainbows, and as he progressed through life the side of him that was a dreamer slowly died, and to replace it realism took the reigns. The realism that hearts get broken, stars don\u2019t align, however the boy didn\u2019t pay much heed. He went through most of his life not caring about girls or love or any of that sappy stuff, but rather focused on his classes and education in hopes of getting into a university and making his parents proud. As time passed this boy would go through middle school, and high school with realism as his steed and reasoning as his weapon. Until one day in his his final year in high school he sees a girl. A girl he has feelings for? A girl that he has a crush on but still doesn\u2019t attempt to make a move. Too scared of the consequences of a broken heart and what others would say, he thanks reasoning for not putting himself or his heart in harms way. But as time progressed this boy would go to college and learn more about how everything that happens in life is explainable. Whilst there he would look back on the days when he was a kid and think about how foolish he was to believe in dragons and faeries and princesses in castles, but most of all, how foolish could he have been to believe in a \u201chappily ever after\u201d. Months would pass and he would learn of a plague that affected his land, he would have to go back home for the first time in a year and tell his parents the adventures he and his noble steed had been on. He was proud of the work he\u2019d done while away and spent his time at home learning and playing with what few friends would come out during the troubled time. However it all changed one day. Or one night rather, as he was walking along a lonely road at twilight. The moon shined on him, as if a spotlight on this stage we call life. And he began to think of past people and memories, missed opportunities and unspoken words, and he began to think about this girl. Immediately he tried to dismiss the thought of her but he couldn\u2019t as if for the first time in a long time he began to dream once again, however it wasn\u2019t long before reality neighed, \u201chow can you like a girl you\u2019ve never met\u201d \u201c how can you be so foolish\u201d, however the boy once thought to a phrase from long ago. A phrase about how the heart has it\u2019s reasons for which reasoning knows none, and as if fate had come down and smacked him on the head, this girl he\u2019d never met before was all he could think about. In a moment the boy was overwhelmed and confused by this feeling. A feeling to which there was no rational explanation or understanding a feeling so powerful he was willing to give up everything to spend a day with this girl he\u2019d never met.

I just wanted to get some feedback.\n\n  So I need to give you the summarized version of my past. Currently, I'm 27, almost 28. I had a 4 year relationship in high school and college that ended due to me always choosing drugs, being in jail, and quite frankly I was completely immature. In 2014, about 8 months after the break up, I started hanging with another girl I knew from high school. She loved drugs too and she had just gotten out of jail after doing a full year. We had fun, but quickly she got pregnant. Flash forward a little over a year (June 2016), I have a beautiful healthy baby girl, and I marry her mother. I didn't feel much for her, and oftentimes I resented her (she has diagnosed mental issues) because she could say such hurtful things and not think twice about it. I married her because I wanted a family, her parents wanted it to happen, and I just felt like it was the right thing to do. \n  February 2017 I get arrested. Had warrants. Spent the next 10 months behind bars. She left with someone she met off of \"sugar daddy . Com\" within 3 months. I was broken and coming off hard drugs.\n  December 2017 I get out and go to a halfway house where I am for the next 14 months. Not going to lie, I did use drugs a couple times when I got out, and once more in March, which is the last time I have used hard drugs. I was distraught at how my life had turned out. I lost everything when I was in jail, and was suffering from major depression.\n  January 2020 life is getting better. It took me a year and a half but I finally got my license for the first time in 10 years. I rent an actual house! Things are good. But I'm lonely. I hadn't had time for any relationships and I knew I had some serious work to do on myself in the time between jail and the present, which is what I did. I've always been majorly codependent so I had to learn how to just be okay with and love myself (way better now, still working everyday). There's this girl at work, M. I've known her for about a year and a half. We've always been friends, maybe even a little flirty but it was around this time I started thinking about maybe pursuing a relationship with her, which is weird because I wanted a relationship with nobody but my daughter/family. \n  June 2020 we're all back at work after shutting down. She gave me a big hug the first time we saw each other and I felt something, a spark if you will. In the next month, we started texting a lot, and I ended up telling her what an amazing person I think she is. I was sooo nervous because in case she didn't feel that way, I didn't want to ruin our friendship because she's an actual good person I want in my life one way or another.  She's always said she doesn't date (bad relationship I guess) ever since I've known her, but she didn't shut me down! She actually seemed kinda shocked and excited.\n  Today 2020. I wake up everyday thinking of her, and I go to sleep everyday thinking of her. We've had some serious adult conversations about everything. She is still not committing, which is fine, she needs time. We've hung out a few times and (no sex, were just waiting till we're both completely comfortable with each other, but we have kissed and hand stuff this last time) , I don't even know the right words to use. She has such a bright, amazing personality. She's beautiful. She makes me laugh harder than anyone. I look forward to her texts, and I get butterflies thinking about her all the time. This maybe be a little inappropriate, but I feel like it's a necessary detail. I've always watched porn, since I was 12. Not in an unhealthy way but maybe 4-5 times a month. It doesn't really work for me anymore, there is no movement downstairs for the most part. The weird part though, is that if I think about cuddling with her, I immediately start moving down there. Even if she sends me a sweet text or something. \n  I'm terrified about how I feel. I don't know what it is, but it's so intense. We're so new, I feel like I shouldn't feel like this. I can see myself being with her forever though, having babies. I've never thought like that in my entire life!!! This is not normal lol. She definitely feels some type of way also, but she's also scared, I can just tell. \n  Anyways, sorry for the long post. Was just thinking maybe someone could tell me what's going on in my head!!! Had to give you some details for it to make a little more sense. Thanks!", "title": "I think I'm in love and it scares me"}, {"created_utc": 1597579617, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/iar8mb/my_love_story_towards_my_first_and_only_gf/", "num_comments": 9, "score": 1, "selftext": "The first time I met my GF was at a club.

I even started doing old school moves like the robot and the wave etc. She just stood there in shock. I felt embarrassed and said \"I told you I was bad. Sorry to waste your time\". As I was leaving she hugged me from behind and said \"don't go please. You are so different I love it!\" I turned around and she started to dance like crazy and started doing the old school move I did. NOW I WAS IN SHOCK. She then said \"omg this is so fun. Let's boogie!\" I joined her and and we both had the best night together while people around us was staring at us thinking WTF ARE THESE PEOPLE DOING. 4 years later we are madly in love and now when one of us is sad the other just starts dancing like the first time we met and feel better.", "title": "My love story towards my first and only GF.

We met in college, and immediately hit it off. We both have similar interests, and outlooks on life. Within the last few years, she became diabetic after moving out of state for a few years. When she came back, she'd lost probably 100lbs. She went into the hospital after a sugar spike, an I walked 17 miles to be there for her. While I was with her, she informed me that while she was out of state, she had been raped, and stabbed in the vagina while leaving work. I'm the only person she has told...  \nApparently she had plans to enter a sexual relationship with one of her other friends, but after what happened, she told him \"no\", and he freaked out, got mad, left, then tried to kill himself.  \nI began developing romantic feelings for her roughly 4yrs after we met, but I understand (to an extent) the trauma of what happened to her, and how it's affecting her desire to be with anyone as well as most-likely, her ability to trust anyone. I spend 2-3 days a week with her, and throughout the week we're in constant contact through texts, and online gaming. I make her food because her sister's bf won't let her eat (she's not working because she's high-risk on the Covid scale, so he tells her that if she didn't buy it, she can't eat it even though he's living in her family's house, and making her sis pay his rent (he's a real asshat). I surprise her with little things here, and there that I know she'll like, and I called 911 when her grandma had a seizure, told her she could use my car to get her license, and always try to take her on trips to get her out of the house...I've done a little bit. This past Valentine's day, I finally told her how I feel, and unsurprisingly she said she cared, but couldn't be with anyone.   \nWith this girl, it's never a mistake (in my naive male brain) to tell her that I love her because I've been in love with her for years. She says she'll be lucky if she lives to 50 with her diabetes as bad as it is, so I paid to get her insurance application so she doesn't run out of insulin, and I told her that I want her for more than 50 years, and that I won't let anything bad happen to her. I always try to rid her of any thought that I'll give up, or stop being friends with her and leave if she doesn't feel the same -- we're all adults. She can feel however she feels, and I'll continue to love her, and want nothing but happiness, and the best for her. She's beautiful. She's amazing.  \n...She's the best.\n\nAbout a week ago, I told her that I love her, and her face said that that shocked her, and she didn't say anything back. I didn't expect her to...not 100% anyways. I didn't really have any expectations at all. I just wanted to say it...because I felt it. \n\nI've been going through this life-long off-again, on-again depressive state, an while I don't NEED to hear it, because I know that she cares, and that if she feels the same, I'll find out eventually, and if she doesn't...I'll find out eventually.  \nI'm finding that while it wasn't a need, I really wanted her to say it back. I want the person who means the most to me in this world to love me. Unconditionally.  \n\n\nI don't think I'm going to bring it up, because it seems like she just needs time, and space, and I don't need to be either a headache, or a problem for her. I feel like I've kind of been shooting myself in the foot by talking to her about my depression. \"Girls like confident men\" I hear. I'm confident, it's just...sometimes, I'm...not. I'll protect her, and stand up for her, and do whatever I need to do, but I want her to do the same for me when I'm just not feeling life.   \nOther than continuing life as usual, and continuing to be as good as I've always been to her (which I'm going to do)...what should I do? I can be patient...all any of us have in this life is time...but...I want her to give me SOMETHING. Even if it's a \"you don't stand an ice cube's chance in hell of being with me\". It would hurt me (badly), but it wouldn't kill me, and at least then I'd know that I need to move on.  \n\n\nI'm not the best looking guy, and I'm pretty chunky. I don't believe her to be a shallow person at all, but I know that as far as relationships, everyone wants something nice to look at. I kind of refuse to lose weight FOR some one, because I feel like I only want to be with some one if they want to be with me no matter what I look like. Eventually I'm going to be fat, ugly, AND old/wrinkly! I'll always be me, though, and that should be what matters.  \n\n\nI honestly haven't been in an actual relationship (I was \"with\" a girl for 9mo when I was 18. We didn't kiss, we didn't have sex, she told me she meant it, and I believed her, but then she moved 100mi away, and I broke up with her), and this woman I'm interested in knows that.  \n\n\n...I'm just lonely, and I don't want to ruin this.", "title": "I'm a little bit wounded, but I'm not going to overreact"}, {"created_utc": 1597410596, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/i9lnuj/how_can_i_find_if_he_or_she_is_the_right_one/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "When it comes to the instance of relationship and the vision to find the right person for marriage- No one can decide who stays forever with the similar intensity of love and the equal incense of romance as its beginning.\u00a0\n\nEverything that has beginning surely will have a journey to proceed and every journey is not a soothing passage of love and wine.\u00a0\n\nLife is full of challenges and love plays a significant role in it.

I never felt this way for my ex (with whom I was with for 4 months in 2019), as an example.\n\nSee, we live in different cities, though. It's a 2 hour drive and I don't even have a license, let alone a car. We work for the same corporation and we met during a work related event in my city back in October. The first time I met her I immediately felt there was something special I really like in her.\n\nThen she came back for a similar event a few weeks later. I tried to get to know her better and we chatted a bunch, except I also found out she was taken. Well fast forward a few months, it's now early January and we're both on the same out-of-state weeklong work trip! \n\nTurns out she left him. Unfortunate, but... I was pleased. Yes, yes... Guilty as charged. We went out a few nights with colleagues and on our last night, she was sat at the pub's table right across from me. It went pretty well. \n\nThe next words you're about to read will sound ridiculous, but we even held our legs pressed against one another. It wasn't accidental; I could feel the pressure from her legs onto mine. And I reciprocated. It seemed an appropriate demonstration of affection in the circumstances; I am, after all, her hierarchical superior, albeit in a different branch.\n\nSo we kept it at that, met one last time at the airport before boarding and then we'd go our separate ways, back to our own lives.\n\nI couldn't work up the courage to stay in touch, though, especially due to the nature of our professional relationship. But she did! She texted me a few days later and I was so happy. We've both been chatting every day since then, slowly working it up from friendly to affectionate, and I can't wait to see her again.\n\nThing is, she was supposed to come in the city today but decided to cancel at the last minute. Evidently that makes me very anxious, even if I fully understand her decision. I'm starting to wonder if this is real at all, if it's too good to be true (she is very good looking), if she's just playing along for the attention, or for comedic relief, say if she just shows our conversations to her friends. \n\nI try to shove those thoughts away, but I must admit I am not a trusting person, and I've long been insecure, though I've made a lot of progress lately. I'm also disappointed that she waited so long to tell me she wouldn't be coming. On the other hand, she was at least honest enough to blatantly admit she delayed it because she was afraid of disappointing me.\n\nI trust her, and really like her, but I guess I just need some tips to manage my own trust issues, or expectations, and any input or ideas about how to close this long distance relationship would be greatly appreciated. I can't drive myself to her town, and she says she would feel terrible if I took a bus there (it really is shitty), so I'm trying to find a reason to get there, work related or something, so I can justify the trip without seeming too desperate.

Hope you all having a great day.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to start this story. I\u2019m new in this. It\u2019s been like 4 months since I truly fell in love with this cute girl at my workplace. I never saw a cutie like her in my entire life. The way she speaks make me melt inside and left me lost in her eyes. For the first time in my life, I got love-strucked. It feels way different. That feeling I had that moment is surely changing the course of my life. Then, about 4-5 days later, we getting closer to each other. We chat together either in phone or real life almost every day about work stuff, her final year project paper and other things. I learn that she has a lot of similarities with me. we both currently living in the same street but different blocks, had lived in the same residential area when we studying on a same course but different universities, and many other things. My feeling on her is getting stronger every day. But those are just nothing more but coincidences, aren\u2019t they?\n\nI made my first mistake. The next week, I was being so dumb and asks her \"What will you respond to me when I say I really really really fall in love with you?\". Then, she responds, \"That\u2019s unbelievable. I thought you liked another girl at the workplace. I\u2019m new in here lol.\". \"I see you as a friend\", she adds. I express to her my deep feeling on her but pretend that I just wanted her response and not expecting she likes me back. She feels guilty afterwards and says to me to not giving high hopes and put a gap on our friendship after this. I know this is way too early for that. I am so fucking dumb.\n\nNot long afterwards, I ask about her BF and she tells me about her complicated man. Even though their relationship is getting worse, she always, ironically, giving high hopes on her BF. I feel sad to her when I heard this. I really hope, at least, she gives me a chance to ease her life. But I don\u2019t have a gut to ask for that. I really pity on her relationship. I wish I can come earlier in her life and saved her from her misery. \n\nThen, everything went back to normal. we have conversations about everyday things and replied to each other stories. I feel very calm when I text her. Once I asked her to do a favor for me and I promised to pay back by giving her a treat to a drink someday when we both are free one day. And she agreed, not knowing that I want a date with her. We were that close. That feels when I talk to her in the late night is like talking to myself. We chat almost every day since then until this happens.\n\nAt the end of last month, most of staffs at my workplace, including me and her, decided to quit the shit job. After we both quit, we rarely text to each other. Any posts on social media I made are just left seen without reply, not like before. I start texting her several times to keep updated about our everyday life. She seems pretty enjoyed during the conversation. Until last Monday, things are getting awkward. Neither I nor her started texting. I have an instinct that there is something wrong. Things are not like before. I am very sad.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong or right for me anymore. I can\u2019t stop thinking about her anymore since the day I met her. If she thinks I am her friend then that\u2019s ok. I don\u2019t want to lose her in my life.

More specifically it is the story of the me that was and really is me and the me that is that never should have been.  At one point, I used to write a lot,  and those writing as well as those of my Love, were kept together in the Red Folder.  That was destroyed, mostly by the Dark Love, but that is a story for later.  This is written by the me that was and really is me.  I do not get out very often, but should I remain trapped or finally die, I want my story known.  \n\nI once was a pure romantic.  I believed in love and I loved the idea of being in love, but love seemed to elude me.  I had many crushes and many failures and all I wanted to do was love someone and make her happy.  I was so simplistic and hopeful, so innocent, so bright.  I was lonely, but I was a happy and hopeful lonely knowing that someday love would be found.  I loved my sappy songs and even cried at Snoopy Come Home.  I was young and full of life.  \n\nI miss that me.  I miss the innocence.  I miss never really knowing hurt.  I miss always being hopeful that things would work out.  I wish I could find my way back to that point, but I can not, the dark is too strong.\n\nBack then, the dark was not nearly as strong as it is today.  It was there, born of something unspeakable that happened in my very early past that I can not even remember.  He existed just to protect me, to shield me from that pain, and to shield me from pain to come.  He was there but only made me a little more careful than I should be.  He was a whisper, but I was the voice.  \n\nThis is where I still live, but more on that later.  One day, without warning, it happened.  I was seated together with the one who would be my Love, and we just clicked.  Of course I was so excited about things working out that I was scared half to death it wouldn\u2019t.  She was so precious, she took mercy on my insecurities and wrote me a note to be read after I left her birthday party.  She wrote \u201cGood News\u201d on the outside of it and my heart came alive when I read it.  At that moment, I had someone to love, someone to make happy, and the only dream that ever mattered to me came true all at once.  \n\nI wrote poems, love letters, and tried to master every romantic thing I could think of.  Every moment with her was cherished time, everyday was precious, every kiss was magical.  Of course we had our fights, but I actually cared about those times I was wrong and did everything in my power to make it up to her.   I was in love with my Love and I was in love with being in love.  \n\nThen came college.  At first, I went away to college but moved back home in 2 weeks because I could not stand to be apart from her.  I don\u2019t know what I was thinking!  Then came the stress of college, and it put a strain on our relationship.  She was often stressed and took it out on me but I loved her enough to be her release.  I knew she loved me, but the dark part began to have doubts.  He was not in control and so I let it be, I ignored it, and I kept on loving her.\n\nAt some point, there was a trip planned with friends and she was not allowed to go.  We decided I would go anyway and  we would take it  as a break, as time apart, and come back refreshed and ready to grow our love.  I never thought anything would happen, I never thought she would stray, as I trusted her wholly with my heart.   Sadly, I was wrong. \n\nThis is where I died, sort of.  It was in her room, and she confessed that she kissed someone while I was away.  It wasn\u2019t just anyone, it was a mutual friend, someone who has done this sort of thing before.  It wasn\u2019t just the kiss, it was the who, it was everything.  The hurt came on like a flood and in that moment, the dark went from small to large.  I remember that moment, the moment that feelings left me.  I don\u2019t just mean our love or the pain, but everything.  It was swallowed by the dark and that in that moment I let him take over.  The plan was set, I would find someone else and leave her for that person all the while pretending to work it out.  \n\nI wish I could make some excuse for the cruelty of that motive.  I wish I fought back and worked out that love.  I wish I didn\u2019t let the dark stuff me so far inside myself that I was essentially comatose.  When I woke up last summer, it was as though I was still there.  Its hard to explain how it feels to wake up after 27 years not recognizing my life or anyone in it, including my wife, but I have this insatiable longing to go back to that point and do it all over again, to hold her, to love her, to forgive her and move on into an even stronger relationship.  But I am getting ahead of myself, its now time to talk about the dark.  You see, at that moment, the one who never should have lived as me became me and the life I was never meant to live began.\n\nWhen you\u2019re dark, you attract dark, and I attracted the Dark Love into my life.  She was evil.  I do not say that lightly, but she was.  The dark me was attracted to that darkness and my dark heart was won.  She tortured what was left of me, she destroyed the red folder, any remnant of past love, any idea of anyone else being good, and any idea of me being who I was.  Everything became about my obsession with her.  When she cheated on me, I felt better because I did not have to worry about it happening.  When she asked me questions to terrify me just to prove my love, I said whatever I could to make sure she stayed in my life.  I made insane promises, accepted unreasonable circumstances, wallowed in emotional abuse, and did whatever it is that she asked of me.\n\nEverything was her.  I gave up trying in college, financial responsibility, friendships grew distant, I gave up working just to drive her to work, everything was her and everything in my life began to die.  I thought the dark was big and strong but it was no match for her.  \n\nThis dragged on for months until one day she decided to go back with her abusive ex boyfriend.  Maybe if it ended there, there might have been some hope, but it didn\u2019t.   She came back but was undecided and we decided to go on a trip to Hershey Park.  On the way there, she told me she invited him as well.  Later on that day, while I was winning her a prize, she decided to be with him.  I gave her the prize and she gave me the news.  I was crushed.  We went back to ou hotel, her to a room with him and me to my own room alone.  This is where the dark became what it is today.   He took all my pain, all my hurt, all my misery and consumed it as fuel for controlled perfect anger.   I got them to go back to the park with me and used every bit of manipulation I could muster and picked at him all night and got him to remind her of his true colors.  The next morning, she left with me, and the next day she called him from my room and broke up with him for good.  Dark had won and he liked it.  Dark saw the power in manipulation, and he liked it more.  \n\nOur relationship dragged on for a few more months, and I spent a few months after manipulating her out of other relationships just because I could.  I could have just let her go, but I was angry.  I should have just let her go, but I had an arrogance to feed.  \n\nThat is the moment I became the me that is now.  As the dark, I am pain-fueled anger.  I do not love, I do not care, I do not feel, I just am.  That is how I lived.  Over the next few years, with the exception of one relationship, all I sought were those who were hurt, broken, and previously abused.  I never really cared about them, but I fed off their pain.  I treated them well, but once they were happy, once they were in love, I had nothing to feed on and I broke away until they ended it with me.  I have done that so many times with so many others that I honestly do not even remember them all.  They were just something to do and not someone I cared about.  They just filled a role in my life, nothing more.  As the dark, I would like to take the altruistic point of view in that I helped them all and while that is probably true, it didn\u2019t do it for them.  \n\nI was also an alcoholic by choice.  I wasn\u2019t addicted because when I stopped I just did.  It was a choice.  I drank heavy and hard, encouraged by the fact that I worked for cash and what few bills I did have, I really did not care about paying them.  I also never got sick or hung over and I always had a designated driver.  Being drunk was a relief from the perpetual pain in my life.  Being drunk was freedom.  I was a happy drunk and so sober I was bitter, and angry, and cold and drunk I was happy and fun.  \n\nThere was one positive influence in my life at this time, the one who led me to what faith I have, but sometimes I doubt it is as strong as I make it out to be.  I came to Jesus as dark and my dark has not changed.  I do believe but it is not the simplistic honest faith I had before the dark.  That faith was shattered and tucked away along with the rest of me.  Somewhere deep down back where I am tucked away, I do have faith and that fath comes through at times, but everything else must be questioned.  \n\nThis girl was positive, she was faithful, and she had the peace that I wanted.  Maybe part of me did love her, but I honestly do not know if I wanted the idea of someone safe like her or actually her.  For a time maybe it was the latter, but not for that long.  In the end, she proved untrustworthy, dishonest, and unfaithful, and she is why I question the strength of my faith.  \n\nOur relationship was one of ups and downs.  She broke up with me several times, but each time I manipulated my way back in.  One trip down to visit her, her \u201cfriend\u201d at college with his family came to her parents to visit as well.  It was clear what was going on, but I was thinking that I could trust her.  She went away to London for a week, came home, called me, and told me that she decided to date someone else.  It was that same friend.  \n\nAs an epilogue, a couple of years later, she got back in touch with me.  She was unhappy and he was physically abusive.  This is why I doubt how much my faith has changed me because in a matter of days I manipulated her into letting me come down to visit while he was out of town.  I convinced myself I was doing it for her, but that is really how I justified it in my own mind.  My goal was to take her away from him and get my win.  What I did not know was that they started dating before we broke up, but there was a calendar on her refrigerator with a heart around a day that said \u201cfirst date anniversary,\u201d which was before we broke up.  At that point, I was the same person back at the hotel and in a bedroom.  I still wanted to win, but I did not want to keep the prize.  I slept in his bed, did things with his wife, and made her heart for me again and just led her on never letting her get close.  \n\nI reverted back to my perpetual place holders of broken and abused girls and this dragged on for a very long time.  The only difference is that I did it sober, meaning I was just angry.  This is also the time where I started dating strictly Christian girls.  I never had sex with any of them and I did not necessarily corrupt them, I just brought out the corruptions that were already there.  \n\nEventually, I decided to take dating more seriously and ultimately I found someone very safe to marry with no baggage whatsoever.  I wish I could love her and want her, but I am not capable of those things in my present state.  Plus she never fights for me, she never wants to hear me speak of who I am or what I\u2019ve done, she never takes my side, and she never has my back.  I share with her things like I am writing now and they are just brushed off.  I have tried so many times to be honest that I am not the man she thinks that I am but she ignores me and downplays everything I say and does not take is seriously.  That is why I am writing this here and now because I have no other means of sharing it.  \n\nAnd that brings me to now.  Last summer I decided to look inside and see why I could not be content or happy or even feel and I found me.  I woke up to some extent, but it was like waking up out of a coma.  What I am, as the me that really is, is a 19-20 year old boy in a 45-year old body with an entire lifetime that happened without me and the last thing I remember is letting the dark take over.  My heart is still there, my feelings are still there, everything that is me wants to be there and make a different choice.  I have no connection to my past and in that I have no idea how to bring myself back.  My life is one full of strangers and people I have nothing in common with.  I have no friends, no history, no real chain of memories of how I got here.  I woke up in a foreign world where everyone I loved has moved on with life.  I am awake and alone and stuck under a mountain of darkness that will not let go.  \n\nI want to be free again to be me, but how can I when there is nothing I recognize.  I know you can not live in the past, but that is easy to say when you aren\u2019t mentally and emotionally and literally still in the past.  I can not live in the present because I just got here.  It is easier to just stay inside and let the dark go on being projections of who he wants to me at any given time.  No one knows me, no one knows who I am, everyone just knows what I let them know and sees who I want them to think that I am.  That is how I ended up in the place, but I am tired of pretending.  I am tired and putting a smile on my face and making people believe that I actually like them and like life.  When I speak of the road to where I am, I do not want to lie and say I do not regret it, because I do.  I regret every bit of it.  I resist it, but I want to drink again.  The dark was never meant to be my life, just to protect my heart.  The dark is tired and the real me is lost and scared and broken.  The pain, instead of fueling anger is spilling out all over the place and I am at a point where I am just ready to come apart.  \n\nI feel I am at the end of a life that was never meant to be. I don\u2019t mean physical death, I honestly do not know what I mean, but I know I can not go on like this indefinitely.  At the end I will be either me again or completely cold and dead inside and the fight over what of those it will be rages on.  All I know is the life I was supposed to live went awry 27 years ago and what I have now is a life of pain and failure and a pile of hearts that I have broken and people that I have hurt.  I became a monster of my own making.  I was once brilliant, scholarships everywhere, a plan, a love, and a direction.  Ever since that day in her bedroom, everything has been a failure.  I have made no one happy, I have been successful at nothing, I have no plan, no future, no hope, no nothing.  I am nothing.  Yes I have a son by me and 2 adopted daughters, but it remains to be seen what I mean to their lives.  It is easy to say that if I did not make that choice I miss what I have now, but that is only because I do not know what I missed if I did not make that choice.  I do not know what their lives would have been and how they probably would have been better without me.  This is not the me I was ever supposed to be and this is the life I was never supposed to live, and I have made the best of it for as long as I can.  \n\nIn all honesty, I can not bear all the blame for this.  Yes I made bad choices, but no one ever tried to help me as I slid further and further into darkness.   My friends enabled and eventually grew apart (mostly after I started acting more Christian) and my family ignored it (mostly because my mother prefers everything being dependent on her).  No one loved me, no one cared for me enough to even try to help me turn around.  I do not deserve to be loved as who I am as the dark because I can not love back.  But then, at the beginning, the lack of love just justified the dark.  No one cared about me and so why should I care about myself, my life, or them.  I once had friends, but none proved to be true, and they all watched me die, celebrated along the way, and eventually fell away.  I was not a bad friend, I really wasn\u2019t.  Friendship is big for me and no matter how dark I was, I always had a strong sense of loyalty.  \n\nSo that is where I am now.  I am the dark, I only know how to hurt and use.  I have no poetry or color in my life, just black and white.  I have no friends, just people who honestly do not care about me and ones I just pretend to like because I am supposed to.  I have painted myself into a corner and I am trapped in living a life trapped in the image I created for myself.  What do I want? Freedom.  As the dark, that is not possible and is even less possible to become the me that really is.  How can I live, as me, in a world where I do not know anyone and no one loves me?  How can I live when all my friends I used to know let me die?  How can I live in the wake of all the hurt and pain caused in my absence?  How can I live when the only Love I have ever really had is so far gone from my life, it would be impossible to even consider the possibility of going back?  Not only that, it would be exceptionally selfish and emotionally dangerous to even try.  I can not interject this into her life, not if I do truly love her.  \n\nMy heart is so cold and empty and I made a mistake so long ago there is no hope of ever fixing it.  The me that really is me does not believe in hopelessness, but even I can not see any hope.  I want to wake up way back then, in that moment, and make a different choice.  I want her to want the same thing I do now and correct what I have done for the rest of my life.  I want to love again, to feel again, to live as me again, but I can\u2019t, I have no path to the outside and inside I am trapped and dying.  I want to say that this will have a happy ending, but that has to be written with the help of another.

I honestly was through with girls because I only got into toxic relationships all the time and it just took the energy for me to work. We started working together and everything we did,  planned, communicated was so natural. So after a wile we started talking a bit more about life and stuff, you know deeper, intellectual conversations. I\u2019ll first be interested in a person if I can be mentally challenged by her. We agreed on everything about life, the world etc. It was like we\u2019re the same person, and we totally were. Many times we\u2019d say I can\u2019t believe you took words from my mouth. Anyways things started progressing she started to flirt but I honestly was through with girls and didn\u2019t give in for months, because I was afraid of getting hurt. I knew this was something more because i felt like this once before and it ended up in the most unreasonable way possible - just like this time. It\u2019s a deja vu.\n\nAnyways she progressed her flirting and slowly I did too but i was always 10 steps behind her, even though I wanted to be more daring, something just kept on telling me stop. So it came to the point it became a craving from her side. Then she asked me if i wanted to watch a movie and in short that how it happened. She hugged me first, she gave me the first kiss, I just didn\u2019t want to make a move. We spent 3 months just wanting one another more and more. We\u2019d see each other every day do everything together as we had pretty much everything in common. I loved her and i know she did the same, I felt her. We could just lay down and stared in each other\u2019s eyes for minutes without saying anything. Sorry for being so dramatic but it\u2019s true and i just want to express my feeling i had for her and i know she had the same. She said she wants to be with me for life, she will never let me go or hurt me and i trusted her because she was hurt before like me, so I assumed she knows the feeling first hand. She said she was thinking a lot and wanted to marry me and start living together. I was so happy because I wanted to do the same in the future with her. I said to myself I finally got someone I\u2019ve been looking for for so long.\n\nThen she went to Thailand with her family two weeks ago, we heard each other every day, missed each other and one day she told me she spoke to her father about some business and that it\u2019s really exciting and she\u2019ll tell me in person once she\u2019s back.\n\n(She\u2019s from a extremely wealthy family. I stereotipically avoid such people because I know how little they value little things in life and I was extremely cautious for that from the beginning but she felt different)\n\nOnce she came back we had the best time together and later that day she told me about what her father said. He wanted to give the biggest company to her under condition she moves to a specific country and has to live there for the rest of her life 6 months per year. The other 6 months she could roam freely everywhere. She wanted me to live with her and move in with her but I was so shocked by the idea I saw that 6 months as a prison and as honest as I am I told her that, like don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit captive? And I told her I don\u2019t really feel that country that much, but in the end I said ok let\u2019s talk about it more next time. \n\nI knew I needed time to think. This was such a huge decision and she wanted me to just spit out the answer then and there. I\u2019d go anywhere with her anyways but wanted to sort things out in my head. Well that was the breaking point. She started turning stone cold and would have emotional outbreaks from time to time I did not understand. For days I didn\u2019t even know what\u2019s wrong, why is she like that because I\u2019d have never thought those words would make such a ginormous impact on her. She just started being really agitated if I asked her what\u2019s wrong. I spent my working hours thinking what could it be and thought that conversation could be it. On Sunday I asked her if we can talk and my first question was if she still has feelings for me and she said I don\u2019t know. It shocked me and asked her what did I do and she said, it was what I said to her about moving there and living there. I immediately told her I was thinking about it and I\u2019m ready for it, I\u2019d go anywhere with her just to be with her and not just because of her but it\u2019s something I really wanted in life. I want a change in my life but she wouldn\u2019t believe me no matter what I said. I knew I couldn\u2019t convince her so after we stopped the conversation I left back home because I felt she doesn\u2019t need my presence anymore. It was the hardest thing for me to face such nightmare.\n\nLater that night she\u2019d cry on my texts wanting me to come over. I felt so happy because I thought there\u2019s still chance. Naturally I did and I saw how broken she was. We just hugged and talked in bed until we fell asleep and it felt almost as good as before. I did notice she\u2019d just get lost at moments tho but didn\u2019t say anything. Then in the morning she turned stone cold again, distant, I didn\u2019t know why she's shifting so rapidly, but still just acted natural. The conversation during the day was dry but I didn\u2019t want to push her too much. I\u2019d ocassionly text her, she did the same but very coldly. In the evening she suddenly told he how much she loves me again and wanted me to come over again and so I did, but this time she felt much colder than the night before. We went to sleep and in the morning same story.

I love making him happy by encouraging him when he's stressed or upset and giving him as many cuddles as he needs to make him feel better. I love when we pull away from a kiss and I'm met with his warm eyes looking right into mine, and his huge, adorable smile. I love how affectionate he is with me, smothering me with kisses and not being afraid to snuggle me in public. I never have to question how he feels about me. He tells me when he misses me, how he feels about me, and I can tell from the way he looks at me alone...which makes me feel super warm inside. He works hard and he's driven, and it inspires me to be better too. I believe in him and his goals, and he believes in mine too. He always checks up on me and makes sure I'm okay, even when we're both out together. He'll make sure I'm having a good time and that I'm comfortable...he really cares about me.

I had true love only once but life took it away from me in a mysterious way. Maybe she wasn't ready, maybe she didn't take right decisions, I know I didn't because I was scared and desperate but it resulted in causing a void in my soul and heart like never before and it changed me forever.I'm an extremely kind, rational, optimistic, honest, lovable person - I know I am and I'm not saying this just to make myself pretty but I feel it, I want to be completely honest here, I'm told that very often but mostly because I work that way. It's simply in my nature. I want to make a world a better place to me and around me. I never ever, ever cheated in my life nor will I. But got cheated on once though luckily it was nothing serious. I'm an extremely good lover, I know because I can see the woman, I can feel her feelings either in romance or sex and that deep connection is what makes girls really fall in love with me and I to them. I'm very romantic and emotional and also passionate and innovative in sex, that's really important to me and most of the girls didn't meet my needs on those levels. Only my current one and one I'll never forget had all that. I need someone with a wild imagination, to fulfill my needs and when I connect with someone like this we take love, passion higher and deeper than ever imaginable.Almost all girls I dated always came back to me for a second chance not even once but multiple times when they realized what they had. I always cared for person as much as I could (of course I was always very rational and after years of relationship experiences I learned how important balance is) but I always waited a bit for another person to give me something in return to give them more - and I'm talking about small things. \"Because it's all about small things, there's nothing bigger.\" Relationships always came to the breaking point with me either by life changes or\n\nAnyways this girl came into my life and I was basically done with love since I was just out of a toxic relationship. A girl I dated before was very aggressive and I'd do anything but to fight with someone. I try to find so many ways or talk about it if something's boiling up.This girl I'll call her Shelly (even though that's not her real name, but she brought me a shell from the travel she was last on - small things). Shelly contacted me to do some work for her one day, I'm a digital designer on many areas, we had a meeting and did few projects for her. We clicked instantly and it became more and more personal. This went on for months because I didn't want to go for it, honestly I was done with relationships or sex - girls in general for a while. But it felt great to have someone to talk on a deeper, challenging level for a change. Shelly is a 95% reflection of me in personality, love experiences, ways of thinking... She opened up to me instantly, she just said she knew somehow she can trust me (I heard this before countless times) and I felt the same. She is very passionate like myself and we started teasing each other and flirting but I never started on my own, I just gave her a glimpse here and there while she was really hard to control herself.\n\nI know well how girls crave for a tease and build up for their imagination to run wild until they become out of control. And then they do stupid things (in a good way), I find it enjoyable and funny but I keep it cool. I'm very different like most of the guys who just want to get someone desperately laid, it's the energy and passion, connection on all levels that's driving me to engage with a person and I need time. I never liked one night stands and frankly I only had it once and I felt unfulfilled and awful.If I'm going to connect and have sex with someone I have to get to know them, they have to pass all my red flags and filters and after that I know it will be more than just that.\n\nTo continue, this teasing went on for months while we were working and trust me we clicked on every aspect of business projects, we made incredible results on every single thing we started, it was just - natural. A complete symbiosis. And it felt like this everywhere slowly I knew this could be something else. It so happened my friends canceled to go on a party I really wanted and somehow we got to that topic that she's going there with her friends and invited me along. It was an incredible night out, we got a bit drunk obviously, she was quite a lot ahead of me tho and I stopped drinking after a while just to have a good time on the enjoyable level of drunk. She started dancing around me and took me to the bar where we waited for drinks in line and that's when she turned around and tried to kiss me. I moved away and said we shouldn't do this yet. I know she was drunk and she bit her lip and said \"you're right\". At the end of the party we went home and talked all day next day and in the evening she invited me to watch a movie at her place. I said I'd love to, but still inside I didn't have any intention to move up on her. We laid down together casually and started watching when at some point she moved closer to me, I felt her warm body over me for the first time and I swear I started to melt inside. It was warmth mixed with emotions, tingling sensation in my stomach and pressure on my chest, I secretly wanted her to do this but I still thought it was too soon but I let it be, though I seemed frozen on the outside. A bit later she turned my head with her hand, moved closer and tried to kiss me, that's where I moved away again but I could briefly feel her lips this time, I kinda made her think it's obvious she can have me but at the same time are you really sure about this, I don't want to get hurt again. About 10 minutes passed and she gave it another try, I remember I was stiff and unwilling but eventually I gave up and kissed her back slowly with passion, gently stroking her neck and sensitive spots behind her ears etc. with the tips of my fingers, soft skin on soft skin. It's funny if I told you but I know where the sensitive spots anywhere on the body are, I don't know how but I feel them thru me. I really don't know how to explain better it's just a natural feeling to me.So we kissed and things became more and more steamy but we agreed not to have sex for a month (yeah right). We lasted a week of tease I think and it was before we had our first sex. She came about 20 times, she's a fast cummer and a nymph and she can't have enough just like myself. I find enjoyment in sex if I see a girl enjoying it, that's what makes me even more passionate even more daring. I always put her before me in sex because in the end I'll enjoy it myself.\n\nTo fast forward on she told me I was a complete package, she told me how beautiful I am, that I'm the best kisser she ever had, the best sex she ever had (and she had quite many tbh), she said how she can connect to me on everything, we thought the same, we laughed, we cuddled, we pleased each other days in and days out, we looked in each other's eyes for minutes, just staring deep inside, it was so spontaneous, so beautiful, felt so quick but in reality it took minutes, but I swear we could see each other's soul. You can't fake this, never. I'm a person with huge awareness and I notice the smallest things in energy, expression, acting... We knew i was real love.\n\nShe had couple of break downs in between texting me how she opened up, how she's afraid I'll let her go suddenly because she had so much of this before and I felt her fear, her pain, oh god I felt her. I've been there so many times, in darkness myself. I felt her and I immediately gave her the most comforting thoughts I could that came straight out of my heart to stop her fear from pain. I know darkness, I know it so well and worst is when it happens when you did all you could, when you're the best person imaginable. I knew she was, just like me. I still have those screenshots and they bring tears to my eyes when I read them, when she said she will never ever want to hurt me and leave me. She said this is it, \"I found you... for life...\".\n\nEverything went so well for months, we did so many things together, we're both very successful so money's not the problem either but I worked all my life from this and I started from rock bottom on my complete own to build a life I always wanted for myself, she however is from a very wealthy family but very smart and capable and also not drawn to material things like me, we care for experience, moments, travels but yes this today means time and money, which I know I can have both if I decide so and I worked my ass off to make my life into an adventure of my dreams. For my birthday she painted me a painting and gave me a tooth brush with a message, put it in the cup. That was one of the sweetest gifts I've ever gotten and I felt like crying inside because I know what that meant, what she tried to tell me: \"I want you to be here more often, I want you to live here\".It's the small things in life and small things we did. We cooked for each other, went out together, we enjoy doing fun things together just being at home, so many things, not just watching TV, we fixed each other's things, we cared for each other. She told me she was thinking how she wanted a life with me and how she wanted to marry me, how I'm the only person a full package she wants to be with until the end...\n\nRecently Shelly went to travel with her family (where she brought me the shell from), we talked every day, we missed each other and by the end she told me she has a really exciting news for me while she talked with her father about business, but she wanted to tell me that in person.A week ago she came home and it was the best feeling ever to touch her again, feel her warm soft skin again, kiss her lips, look her in the eyes again. A complete explosion of emotions and warmth. We just laid there, kissed talked cuddled, spent whole day in bed. She also had to rest from jet lag and then she started telling me about what she waited for....\n\nHer father wanted to pass business to her, under condition she goes to live in a specific country because that's where the company is registered at, she'd get a house everything she wanted, but she'd have to stay there for 6 months every year, the rest of the time she could move around freely. Sounds fishy but it's all legal they talked to all lawyers and accountants.\n\nShe asked me if I want to start a life with her and that's she really wants me to be a part of her life. She sounded really excited. This is where I made the biggest mistake in my life, not even realizing the impact. First thing I said is I'm not really a fan of that country and I saw it as a prison to be stuck there for months every year, but I didn't even get time to think. But in the end I didn't conclude anything, I said we'll talk again about this, I just wanted to enjoy the moment with her being back in my arms again.That was the breaking point which I only felt days after and not instantly. She started becoming more and more distant, but I didn't say anything because I thought it was just some minor woman problems or maybe she's having a bad day, best not to bother her with questions, just be me. Enjoy time with her, love her on. This continued to the point when she became really agitated and that's when I knew something's really wrong. We had a really innocent fight when she agreed to go to the lunch with her family while we talked last night what we're cooking etc. Of course I wasn't invited and I asked how she could do that and what am I supposed to do, should I just wait here like a dog for you to come back or leave and she said she doesn't care. At that point I left, I never wanted to be undesired, a thorn to be around after so much care I give to make my person happy. It breaks me.\n\nI stayed quiet for a day and got nothing from her, I hoped she texts me every minute of the day but nothing happened. So I texted he next morning if we can talk nothing else and she said I'll be ready in few minutes. So I came, I could see her face changed stone cold, I could see her suffering something, I could see she had a headache as she had dark under her eyes. First thing I said was: \"What do you feel towards me Shelly?\", and she said: \"I don't know\". That crushed me inside, I could honestly feel the sensation of me falling. Believe me I thought about where I did wrong while we were apart and I realized it could be what I said about moving abroad. So my next question to her was: \"Why, why are you like this so suddenly?\" and she told me it was what I said about moving with her, because she's going to do this either way. I instantly said I knew it I was thinking about it and I told her my deepest feelings and how I thought about it (and I did!) and that I wish to do with her. I told her it was to quick for me to come up with an answer that responsible, but she gave me no time to think. I'd have to move away from my family and my life for the past years was a mess... I was living in a bubble of work and after some time I started forgetting what I was even working for, that this is what I was working for all along. I started to become lost, hopeless, too attached to an unhappy environment. I needed to break that bubble, to wake up but I couldn't do that in an instance... and I regret that more than anything in my life.I told her all this exactly and more, I cried so hard, she did, she hugged me, kissed me, tried to comfort me, I knew I might not ever get her back, because she wouldn't believe me. She would only believe my first instinctive words that came out of my mouth and she was afraid to get hurt in the future by me telling her how wrong of a decision I made. She was afraid to get hurt so she closed in and her answer to me about: \"Could we still be the same?\", was: \"I don't know...\"\n\nI thought I knew her, I though she was like me in the way of thinking, because I would never ever make a decision like this this quickly, without understanding another completely, talk through things, because these are big moves not just some daily things and in the end cool down in the matter of days not even wanting to talk. She kept on saying to me how talking about problems is important to her and here we are. How she'd never want to hurt me or let me go when I told her I'm afraid to completely let go to her and here we are... I sill keep all these screenshots of our texts.\n\nWe said we'll talk through because I know she has other problems not just that but she's really agitated when I ask her and doesn't say anything. She said she needed few days to think, I'm scared of loneliness, I'm scared of thought how good of a life we're throwing away, I'm scared of how fast people change no matter how deep the love goes and how much good you did to them, just based on experiences with people who treat you like a toy and hurt you over and over. That's where fear comes from in her case too and she said she doesn't want to get hurt again. Instantly she lost trust, even though like I explained I'm the most honest person on every step you'll ever find.Too honest even that's why I ended where I am now, even though I'm completely honest with my final decision - the one which cannot be believed anymore.\n\nDuring the days of thinking she called me over, she send me crying emojis how she wants me there. She said so many times \"I love you\". But our conversations were dry I could feel it and I tried not to make a scene about it even though I was scared to my bones. I cried so much at home, I couldn't focus on work, I just sat into my car and started driving around crying. I couldn't stand living and thought how things and people change this quickly. And mostly exact same thing happened to me with my first true love under different reasons. I gave everything and never fully recovered. I'm scared.One evening I got a text of hearts and how she loves me, honestly. How deeply she loves me and after that she asked me to come over. But every time I did, yes we did kiss like we used to I could feel it, but her actions were, how to says, really unpredictable. One minute she was like stone totally in her own world, and another she snuggled to me and kissed me. I was lost but I just hoped for more such moments. I didn't want to be pushy but I wanted to know her I love her so much. Few times during these days it slipped out I'm afraid of her decision and I wanted to eat myself from the thought after but I didn't know how to react. How could you? It's so rapid so unnatural, I kept telling myself be casual, be constant but it breaks you, just like feelings broke her and slipped out of the \"shell\". I know her flames are still burning deep down under but how to open them?I held her all night in a spoon sleeping position she feels most comfortable and she even moaned from satisfaction and in the middle of the night she even came to me few times when I turned but rarely, mostly she was turned away on her own. That wasn't her, I noticed that but kept it for myself.\n\nWe talked tonight. It was the calmest talk ever. No matter what I said and how I tried to tell her how we could solve things step by step she wouldn't change her mind. Her mind was made after those words I said she didn't want to hear. I wanted my life with her, yet I lost another in the most in just way possible. I often wonder why bad things happen to good people? Am I not meant to express my love potential in life? Is it even worth going on after you've given everything over and over again? I gained so much experience with my past relationships, I really did analyze the breaking points, the mistakes I made and made it better and better in every relationship. I wish I could go back in time and said things differently. Fear. Fear is what breaks us and life always found a way to threw a brick in my head.\n\n  \n\n\n\\- I wish I made cures for, how people are.", "title": "How losing true love only took few sentences..."}, {"created_utc": 1580945942, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/eziv4n/cant_get_him_off_my_mind/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been long distance because we go to different colleges, which I was so scared would hurt our relationship but it hasn\u2019t at all.

Everything just feels right with her, for the first time in my life I feel like I found a place where I belong.  I feel like she is the one I was meant to be with.  I met her because out of spite I was looking to become the best me I could be after the first girl I fell in love with(who was a long time friend) decided to cut me out of her life entirely and block me on everything.  I won't go into detail but several very specific events took place that would have never happened normally and this was how we met.  It wasn't love  at first sight or anything cheesy like that.  In fact it wasn't until a couple weeks later that I started to develop any feelings for her.  \n\n\nFast forward 5 months and she is currently my girlfriend but has stated on numerous occasions that she is scared I am going to leave her like everybody else.  She has a VERY traumatic past that she keeps mostly secret because she is scared that sharing too much will push people away.  I am entirely devoted to her and have told her I am in love with her, and regularly say \"I love you.\"  She told me a couple days ago when she was very scared that she feels like she and I define love very differently, and that she does not yet love me.  She told me that she cares about me a lot, but that she is scared I will be offended by her not saying \"I love you\".  She told me \"All I want to do is experience life and love and peace, and I'd really like to do that with you\" but she made it very clear that what she defines as love is something far more than what she feels for me.  \n\n\nThis didn't bother me because I know she cares about me and wants to be with me.  I thought to myself \"She may not yet love me, but she feels like she might someday.\"  and I was okay with that because it meant there was hope of our relationship going the distance.  \n\n\nLast night/this morning(We are both up all night and the sun had just started rising.  Morning for others night for us) she had a bit of a breakdown.  She pushed away any and all physical contact and proceeded to start sharing some of her traumatic past.  She was convinced that she had to keep this side of herself secret because she didn't want to push me away, but in this moment she acted rashly and was intentionally trying to push me away.  Needless to say she failed to push me away, much to her surprise.  After she recovered from that a bit and was back to her usual cheerful self she called me over because she wanted a hug.  After a few minutes she proceeded to say \"I love you\"  \n\n\nI'm sitting here now several hours later, after we slept, unable to contain my joy.

My cramps were still painful as usual and my flow was still a bit on the heavy side. But my last cycle my cramps still hurt but feel different. My flow was more spotting and maybe one day of super light flow. The past few days I've been feeling nauseous but not enough to throw up, more discomfort. This morning I woke up feeling that I needed to urinate and when I went, hardly anything came out but I felt pain and immediately thought UTI.

Now my thoughts are going towards pregnancy.\nMy mom told me she knew she was pregnant because she always felt nauseous but never threw up. My best friend said she knew she was pregnant both times because she knew her body. My boyfriend and I are 25, been dating for a year and a half, but have known each other for 8 years. We don't use protection anymore, but he pulls out wayyy before he feels like he's going to cum as we are both afraid of accidents. But as I know that's now how both God and biology works, my mind still wonders towards that possibility. Maybe I'm paranoid? Maybe I just have a UTI? Should I take the test just in case?

I've also been thinking a lot about this recently and I like sharing the story despite the way it ends.\n\nThe last relationship I was in ended a little over 8 years ago and the breakup was a bit messy. The experience left a really bad taste in my mouth and even after 2 years had gone by I was still not interested in anyone and I began to wonder if I was going to be that way permanently. Well... I didn't wonder, I actually took that to be a matter of fact. But just as I began to think that way, something happened and it was something I didn't know was happening until about a year after when I started thinking about it again.\n\nI had just entered my 2nd year in college and I transferred to a school very far away from where I grew up. It was my first time ever going to a sleep-away college. Shortly after arriving to the college I started making friends and it was really cool. I still keep in touch with some of those friends to this day 4 years later. While I was there, I got involved in one of the clubs and that's where I met her.\n\nAt first I didn't really think much of her and it wasn't until a couple of times the club met where I was always randomly matched up with her either in a group or one-on-one where we got to interact a lot and maybe get to know each other better than it was intended. We got along great. Unlike a lot of other guys my age, I had long-since grown really comfortable in social situations with girls and guys alike so it was really friendly and casual. At some point not long after we had gotten to know each other the club was going to an event, in other words it was a field trip. It was at a beach and since I had to pack lightly since I was going away I didn't bring any swimwear with me, but I wasn't really into swimming anyway so I was alright chilling  and watching the big cargo ships go by. For some reason I didn't quite understand, she never went to join her friends, instead she stuck around and talked with me the whole time. \n\nOn another field trip we talked a bit as well, but she spent more of that time with her friends which was understandable. But one of the things she talked a lot about was the way her roommates treated her. Apparently they were not very considerate of her and they would constantly disrupt her while she was trying to study and they would be very loud while she was trying to sleep. She would ask me if I knew how she could find another dorm to stay in but I was as new to the college as she was so I was unfortunately no help for her. But I also had some pretty disruptive roommates as well so we had that in common. I don't know if she felt the same, but it was nice having someone to relate to.\n\nThere was one point where I began to wonder if, maybe, she liked me. I'm really bad at reading these things so I wasn't entirely sure. But the thought kept buzzing in the back of my head, and I could help but feel comfortable enough being around her that, if she did like me, I would reciprocate those feelings. There was one point, somewhere in this timeline, where I was in a conversation with her and a few other mutual friends, and the conversation went to alcohol. Now, I was a pretty straight edge kid but I didn't bash anyone for drinking, especially if they were of age. I mentioned how I had never drank alcohol before because I wasn't old enough to. This got her attention (from what I remember) and she asked me how old I was and I told her that I was 19. This was when I found out she was 5 years my senior and she kind of looked disappointed as she told me that I seemed so much more mature for being a 19 year old guy. I don't know if this meant she liked me or not, but I was a bit surprised that she looked slightly disappointed by that.\n\nThis didn't hinder our friendship though. We still talked and got along great, but as finals were rolling in that semester the club wasn't meeting as much and everyone, including myself, was getting busy with studying and working on final projects and papers and whatnot. I wasn't seeing her very often anymore because of that.\n\nOne day my PC was acting up and the hard drive encountered a read/write error and I wasn't able to use it anymore. I decided to take it, that weekend, to the mall where there was a Microsoft store where hopefully it could get fixed since I had a paper due at the end of the semester. For some reason, I have no idea why, I did not take the bus that left the stop closer to my dorm, opting for the one that was a farther away but got to the mall quicker. I had my computer in my backpack and boarded the bus and it departed on its way to the mall. At the first stop I just happened to look up and that moment I saw her and she saw me. I've never seen someone's face light up that way when they saw me before in my life. She let out a gasp and made her way quickly down the isle and I was so worried that she might fall. She didn't though, and she asked if she could sit with me, and I told here of course she could. She told me that she was looking for apartments to stay at so she didn't have to live with her current roommates anymore. She asked me one more time if I knew any places she could stay and I still had no answer for her. But she seemed okay with that, I don't think she was expecting me to know. Her stop came before mine and our talk was only brief since her stop was the next one. When we got to her stop we said our 'see you laters' and I watched her get off the bus and walk in the opposite direction of the bu past the window. At that moment, I knew two things: 1. I really liked her; and 2. This was probably the last time we would ever meet again.\n\nIndeed that was the last time I ever saw her. I realized that, despite the fact that I really did like her more than I initially thought I knew that there was no way it would have worked out between us. I was too young for her and I can empathize with that now since I am her age back then now. Also neither of us were natives of where we were going to school. She was an exchange student and I wasn't going to be able to go back to that college because of how expensive it was, and when I went back home and she went back home we would be probably close to 8000 miles apart and I was not mentally or emotionally mature enough to handle a long-distance relationship like that. We also didn't really exchange social media since we were so used to meeting in person fairly frequently it didn't really cross our minds.\n\nI've had other crushes since then, but none of them had made me feel as special as she did. She made me feel like I had value outside of what I thought I was worth. I still think of her sometimes but even though this story has kind of a sad ending I'll never forget that short moment we shared on the bus. It felt like something out of the movies, like out of a bitter-sweet romance anime or something. But I'm glad that my last memory of her is this. I hope she's out there doing well for herself in what she decided to pursue.\n\nI don't know if what she made me feel was even a taste of what it feels like to be loved, but if it was then I hope I can find something like that again. I like to find meaning in the things that happen in my life and I feel like her and I meeting and having the interactions we did had a purpose. I don't know what it was just yet, but she had my defenses broken down like no other and it proved to me that I wasn't completely closed off to love the way I thought I was.\n\nAnyway, there's my long story of a girl I only knew for a couple of months but grew to really care for despite that.", "title": "It's Been Almost 5 Years, But I Will Never Forget Her"}, {"created_utc": 1580867122, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ez1e1i/i_love_my_girlfriend_so_much_and_im_going_to/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "Valentine's Day is a week from now, and it's gonna be hard for me knowing that I can't see my girlfriend on the holiday.

In 2018 I was still in school. Was my last year. In September or October, a new girl came into school. You might be thinking I felt in love with her immediately, but no, I didn\u2019t. I already knew this girl from elementary, as well as my classmates, although I never had a good relationship with her in the past. When she arrived to school, I had a crush on another girl, which I expended most of time with. So somehow, this new girl, let\u2019s called her Miranda. So Miranda felt in love with me, but what cause that was another girl that had a crush on me. I rejected this girl, and funny enough she sat down behind me, so I moved to the front, but my teacher sent me once again to the back, but now, I was in front of Miranda. So we started talking, and she started liking me. She had some weird fetishes, specially the ones with the feet. She will start touching with one of her feet during class, or even telling very sexual stuff. That Christmas we made a secret Santa in school, and my mom bought a big box of Ferrero chocolates to give to my secret Santa, but once on school, Miranda wanted that box, so I gave it to her, and that was what started everything. Lots of my classmates started asking me if I had given her those chocolates, to which my answer was the she asked for them, and that\u2019s why I had given her those chocolates. At some point she was so pissed off that she gave me back my chocolates. We literally expended that entire Christmas vacation talking v\u00eda Snapchat, even on Christmas\u2019s Eve, when you\u2019re supposed to be with family. Alright, so 2019 comes, and she now started offering me to send me her nudes, to which I told her; \u201cEEEEWWWW, NO! GROSS\u201d To which she obviously got pissed off. Also, she offered me a blow job, to which again my answer was no, that she was ugly, and gross, even tho I had feelings for her. I told her all this things not because I felt like, but because of pressure. I was tired of my classmates shipping us, that I had to tell this things. I once was so damn angry that I made a terrible decision of telling her she was nothing special to me. I felt terrible, and told her sorry, and tried to pretend I never told her that. Since February was coming, I bought her a heart shaped box of Ferrero Chocolates, but even after that, I kept telling my classmates that she was gross, whenever they will ask me I had feelings for her. Also, through out January, I will usually tell her I liked her, but immediately tell her I was kidding. All of this attitudes basically started separating us not only as a couple, but as friends. She loss feelings for me, and my feelings started growing for her. Going to school used to be my happiness, always watching her, talking to her, being with her the entire day. That was my inspiration, that made me a better person and student, but when I lost her, I returned to what I used to be. Always arriving late, giving a fuck about everything, etc... But now, those attitudes where even worse than in the past. Sadly, we never became what we used to be once again.

So, it\u2019s been a while. We never got to meet in person. It was a short, 4 month relationship that ended due to some mental health struggles on his end. No one was wronged, but I was devastated at the time because I truly felt a bond with him, and adored him. It took me a very long time to get over it. I cried every day for months and truly mourned the end of this relationship, as small and insignificant as it may seem.\n\nWe maintained a little contact, where we\u2019d make some small talk once every few months. At one point we had a period where we were flirtatious again, for fun. But it was all short lived. \n\nAs time went on we spoke less and less. About 2 years ago I had to be in his area for a work trip. I let him know of this, and asked if he may want to use that as an opportunity to meet. He ended up declining, saying that didn\u2019t want to hookup (this isn\u2019t what I was asking for) and that temptation would be strong if we were meeting. I was saddened by this, but accepted it and carried on. \n\nWithin the past few months we have spoke a bit here and there, nothing long, nothing special. At this point, we are 24 and 25, and both in relationships now. But, he has established that he misses his friendship with me.\n\nToday, he messaged for the first time in about two months, to apologize for not meeting me 2 years ago. He told me his reason for doing so was disrespectful, that I deserved better and that his response was devaluing of our friendship. He said he was feeling reflective today and trying to right some of his wrongs. He said that he has been kicking himself all this time about it. And that he\u2019s wanted to get to know me again, because he feels like he\u2019s been missing out on a great person. He said if I\u2019m in the area again, he would like to meet me if I felt ok with that (as friends). \n\nThis kind of gutted me. I\u2019ve always had strong emotional feelings toward him. Seeing a notification with him name always makes me feel like my heart is stopping. I feel touched that he felt compelled to apologize for something so long ago... but also so confused.\n\nOur relationship was a small, insignificant-to-most fling. None of my friends understand it. But for some reason no matter how much time passes, it seems to always come back to me in some capacity.\n\nI know he is speaking platonically... but my god does this confuse me.", "title": "I\u2019m constantly being followed by this small former relationship that most wouldn\u2019t even count as real.

We can only love you, your warmth and your beautiful mind. You were made for adventures and fights, drinking in a dark tavern and laughing your traumas away.

You are the hero of a story never to be told, and it\u2019s your tragedy. \n\n\nSometimes, you take me in your arms and kiss my forehead.

You seem to care about me and you understand me. Despite not really knowing each other that much I feel like I can tell you anything. I\u2019ve never felt such feelings for anyone in my life. Almost like for the first time I actually fell in love. Rather than just thinking you were hot and I thought I was in love. \n\nI\u2019ve known you for almost 2 years. We\u2019ve talked to each other for just over a year. Throughout that time I think I\u2019ve spent more time being afraid of you leaving me than actually trying to get to know you\n\nBut when we have talked about stuff and I complimented you. It was always special to me. I feel like I love everything about you. Everything checked out pretty much. Everyone I knew liked you and didn\u2019t see any red signs or anything as well as me. I didn\u2019t think it was infatuation and I didn\u2019t feel like I had to change you to be perfect for me. The only thing I had to worry about at that point was whether you would say yes or no if I confessed to you\n\nI\u2019m sorry I confessed at such an awful time. 7 months ago. I had completely forgotten you had said to me you realized you didn\u2019t want a relationship at the time before I confessed to you and I only remembered when you had told me again. Me living across the country from you doesn\u2019t help either.\n\nI felt so stupid.. so so stupid. I know you didn\u2019t say you would never date me. You even said maybe when I said I hoped maybe you\u2019d change your mind one day and asked if we could still be friends. I feel like you could\u2019ve easily ignored that but you said it anyway. But honestly I still feel like it\u2019s over sometimes\n\nBut that\u2019s the funny thing about my mind. I\u2019m so used to thinking pessimistically because I\u2019ve always been disappointed growing up that if I experience something as amazing as you coming into my life I just feel like it\u2019s too good to be true. I\u2019ve even tried self sabotaging my own friendship with you at one point. But you\u2019re still here; and I still feel like whatever could come out of us being together would be amazing\n\nThat\u2019s probably why I still love you as much as I did 7 months ago. We hadn\u2019t really talked at all since. Not that I was scared you just didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. But here I am. I\u2019m just hoping maybe when you do feel ready to be in a relationship I happen to be closer in your life and maybe you might think of me. I just hope you\u2019ll at least give me a chance. Take it slow. Maybe just go walk in a park. I want to express my feelings to you. Whether it\u2019s through text, holding hands, or hugging each other and not wanting to let go\n\nI feel like a creep making this. But it\u2019ll still swept under the rug.

My dating life has never been the greatest . And I'm starting to think that part of it has to do with me.\n\nI'm a lifelong introvert. I've always been shy and like to avoid big social gatherings. Recent events have made that a lot easier. I'm also been diagnosed as slightly on the spectrum (Autism Spectrum Disorder), so I dont always see the signs of a bad relationship. I always seem to attract damaged, needy women who flake on me at the drop of a dime.  My last serious relationship (a long distance one) ended three years ago because neither one of us wanted to move. My first and only live in relationship ended nearly nine years ago because she was an absolute control freak. Aside from those two women, nothing has really stuck for me.\n\nAnd yet, every time I go on Facebook, I see people younger than me by nearly ten years getting engaged, taking photos with their SOs or proclaiming their love for one another.

In this feeling I started to think back on things past. I wanted to get it out and the only way I could think of how was to create an account here and share it with the world. \nIn high school I was a small bit of a ladies man, mainly because I grew up in redneck territory and I was edgier, a metalhead. Well because of this I had to keep my reputation up and in my high school days that meant use women, and then replace them. I feel horrible about it now, but unfortunately I don't have the power to fix the past. Beyond my womanizing was the drugs and alcohol. That is until one day I met her. She was my first love, and my dearest. I stayed with her longer than I did any other girl by a longshot. She understood me in a way that to this day no one else can come close to comparing to. I stopped drinking and smoking when we were together, not because she asked me to but because at the time I no longer felt the need to use them. We had passion and love, but as often good things never last. There were still plenty of women that I hadn't slept with so I moved on, leaving her ruined in my wake. I bounced around, partying now more than ever until I found the person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with, however I soon found out how wrong I was. The woman I found next I stayed with for even longer, not out of love, but fear. She was punishment for how I treated other people, she controlled me in every way. She chose who I was friends with, eventually leaving me with none. When she tried making me pull away from my family I had enough and rebelled. Sadly her grip on me was too strong and I stayed with her, at the cost of alienating myself from everyone else I loved. Thankfully she eventually got bored of me and left, I wasn't enough for her is what she told me. That is what opened my eyes for me, the way that she made me feel when she told me that is what I had been doing. After this I pulled myself together after a few months and went back to the woman I had truly loved. We got back together and were very happy for a little while until graduation came. She was staying in our town. I was going to college. It was one of the hardest things I had to do, say goodbye to her. We knew distance wasn't going to work, and this was in the earlier days of cell phones and in our town we barely had working dial up internet. I left and went to college where I met my wife. I met her sophomore year of college and we have been together since then. \nI made a mistake. I love my wife don't get me wrong, it's just not the same. Try as she may she just doesn't understand me all the time. It has created rifts between us, and I fear we might start to be growing apart. I'm friends with the woman who has my heart on Facebook and everytime I see her posts I get butterflies. I almost messaged her tonight, if she didn't have a husband I might have. I can't help but think how differently my life would have ended up if I had just stayed put. Sure, I may not have experienced all of the things I did leaving the town, but that's a small price to pay for being truly happy. \nI guess the morale of my ramblings are, always choose your heart.

We started out commenting on each other's Twitter posts - eventually slid into DM's - and eventually started texting.  It was strange at first because we are 12 years apart in age.  I loved talking to her.  We grew distant for a few years, felt like longer, but I never could forget her.  I will never forget the first time she reached back out to me and she told me everything she had been through over the time we had not talked.  I wished I could have been there for her, but at the time it just wasn't in the cards.  We would reconnect for a bit and fall away again. Through the years I got to know her though and I grew more and more attracted to her.  Who she is, shared interests, and she is absolutely beautiful.  She is the woman I know that I would do anything for.  Last year we kind of left on bad terms and it ate away at me.  I hated the way it felt to not have her in my life, but I felt helpless.  Right as quarantine started she texted me and I felt like the world had completely changed.  I think we both felt bad for the way we had been.  I have never missed anyone more in my life than I had missed her.  It gets me choked up just typing it.  The problem had always been she has had a BF.  We would still talk and flirt and get to know each other though.  She went AWOL for a few weeks and came back to let me know that she had broken up with her BF.  She told me everything that happened and all I wanted to do was comfort her.  It was the perfect chance to make a move, but how could I prey on a woman that I care so deeply for.  So, I put my feelings aside and helped her through things.  I just wanted to be there for her, not for my own personal gain, but because that is what I felt I should do for someone I love.  It just felt like the right thing to do.  I know it probably sounds stupid, but I guess that is just me.  They have been trying to work things out, but something has changed and I could tell.  I eventually took a biased approach and told her that I think she should go out with me.  Which would have to wait to see if she wants to get back with him.  We still talk and share things with one another.  She knows exactly how I feel and really has for a long time.  I was never shy about telling her what I think about her.  For never meeting, I think I know more about her than anyone else I know.  She just started playing my favorite video game too and I hope we have an opportunity to share that.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is...for six years I have had ever growing feelings for her.  I knew from the beginning that she was going to be special.  She never seemed to leave my mind over all this time.  We always find each other again and again.  We have seen some of the worst parts of one another, but still we are here.  I see her and I see someone I want in my life for as long as I possibly can.  My words are all over the place.  She is everything I have ever wanted all wrapped up into one person - and I don't think she realized just how special she is sometimes.  All I want to do is show her in every way possible just how much she means to me.

I know she cares about me so it must be hard for her too.  But we promised we would always be friends.  So I need to stop.  It isn't going to be easy.  And I can't honestly say that ill stop feeling this way, but I deserve to love and be loved.

She's really far away. She's in Spain and I'm in Sweden. Both born 03, so we're really young. We're too young to meet and it makes me sad. I've been in relationships before but they all have been toxic and bad. Though this girl is really special, when we first started talking both showed interest, on Snapchat. Both saved our texts, sent emojis, asked how the other felt, she tells me she's happy I'm alright and I do it too. Whenever she talks about her friends she always let's me know that they are female friends and not guys. At first I was only trying to be friends and I could feel that she wanted more, she really showed interest in me. I didn't catch that at first. I've snapped her and put on my story of pictures on me on parties and with some female friends. Whenever I did that (never on purpose) I felt she was jealous and sad. She doesn't use her phone that much either, responds in the morning and sometimes in the night. So there's a really big time gap between our texts. I couldn't hold back no more as I began to get feelings for her so I had no other choice but to tell her, what I can I lose right? I texted her \"Hi! I've been very off lately :/.  My day has been okay, been spending time with my family and cousins. I hope you're having an amazing day because you deserve it!!\ud83d\udc95 I really wish we could talk more because I really enjoy talking to you. You have no idea. I wake up wishing you have sent something. By the way all the girls you've seen on my snap have all been just friends. I was just trying to find friends to talk to but you made me like you \u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\udc98. Goodnight sleep well.\"  She replied the next day telling me that she understands and that she likes me too. And that I got nothing to explain. I felt relieved and happy. A few days later we almost had an \"normal\" conversation with gaps as 1-2 hours. She told me a funny story but I was really busy so all I responded with was \"hahahah okay\". She read it and went quiet for 2-3 days. I didn't want to tell her I was busy at that moment because I didn't want to hurt her but I probably should have. Later that day I sent her a text saying: \"Hey! I've been very busy today. Couldn't really talk as much. Hope you're having an amazing time.\" And asked her how she was. As I've mentioned she didn't respond for 2-3 days. Under those days I text her saying I'm worried and wondering what's happening. Must've been because of my dead answer. I probably shouldn't have texted her as much as I did while she was gone. Afterwards she replies with an apology and that her phone was broken. Everytime she goes quiet she comes back with the excuse of her phone being broken, I got it the first time but she was active on snap under those days so she must've been ignoring me. We talk and a few weeks go by (1-2 weeks). Sometimes she goes quiet and comes back again and it does really hurt. She's stopped using hearts and other emojis. But she doesn't want me to stop talking to her. The time and distance between me and her is killing me. I've been really stressed out and feeling depressed. I always get butterflies when sending a text or opening one from her. We call our texts letters \ud83d\udc8c. Do I keep it going or just leave it? I really like her.

I don't know if that person will see this but hey I feel like sharing, so here goes.  \n\nSummary: I met a new girl and she seemed super excited to be talking to me in the beginning.  But it turned out that precisely at that moment she was preparing for a really important exam that would determine the course of her career/future.  So basically she told me that we could talk again when she was finished with it.  I obviously respected that, I know it's important for her, and I was enjoying pleasantly feeling love without being demanding about it.  Eager for what might happen. (Original thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gzbfsp/still_in_love/)).\n\nNow I knew this may have just been some lame excuse, but who knows?  I was pretty 50/50 about it.  No way for me to know for sure... I was prepared for either outcome.\n\nWell the date of her exam came, I gave her a few days, nothing.  So finally I reached out to ask how everything had gone.  She said \"it was fine\" pretty much, in a short way, and that was that. No \"how are you?\", no nothing.  I don't totally understand why she even responded at all, but that's OK.\n\nI thought about asking her what was up, but I decided to leave it.  If she wanted to talk, she would talk.  No need to investigate more or anything like that.  It was a pretty clear signal from her.\n\n*Sigh.*\n\nI guess what bothers me is that she seemed pretty excited about meeting me and talking but then she didn't even give me a chance.\n\nBut that's OK.  I'm happy with the way I handled it.  Very happy.  I was vulnerable with her, I was honest with her, I was respectful towards her needs and wishes.  And when the \"no\" came in, well, I left it at that.\n\nA swing and a miss this time.  But it bodes well for the future.  \n\nHell, it bodes well for the present.  My love was truly unconditional.  I truly just wanted to share it with her.  I was not demanding anything.  And I know that because, despite the initial frustration from her rejection, this did not \"knock me out\" like it used to in the past.  I was ready for anything.\n\nLove is always ready for anything.  If it's not, it's not quite love yet.  Love makes no demands.\n\nAnd thank God.  That means it's available to us anytime, anywhere, any place.

After that, I knew I needed time alone. Through therapy, rebuilding relationships w/ friends/family and learning to be happy ALONE, I finally felt like I Was healing. At the beginning of this year I decided to download tinder, I really was not looking for much other than to get laid because it grossed me out that my ex was still the last person i had been with a year later, plus I was horny (sue me lol). I\u2019m not the type to have one night stands (says every women ever lol) but I knew I wasn\u2019t ready for anything serious on this journey of self discovery and learning to be alone. \n\nI finally chose a guy, we texted for two days and then i went to his apartment to do the deed lol. We had a couple drinks, had great sex, and I left thinking I would never see him again. Until the next morning when he texted me..we made this into a regular  \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d kind of thing. We hungout about once a week, I got a good morning text every single morning, he would call me things like babe and baby. We talked about going on vacation together. He would tell me sometimes he liked me as more than a friend, told me he loved me during sex before and would sometimes be lovey dovey. Other times he would be void and cold and act distant or annoyed with me. I thought the situation was fine because we weren\u2019t that compatible in other areas of our lives (didn\u2019t have much in common) and I didn\u2019t see us ever being in a serious relationship. He wasn\u2019t \u201cthe one\u201d..  but the sex was amazing, he actually respected me and wanted to talk to me after we banged, and we got along as friends for the most part so why not? \n\nFast forward a few months and he tells me he\u2019s moving out of state (temporarily) for a few months, could be longer. But he still wanted to be friends and text me everyday and that he would \u201cwait for me\u201d (not see other ppl), i Said I\u2019d do the same. Which is kind of a weird concept for a FWB situation. We said we could meet halfway sometimes to see each other. Well it\u2019s been 2 months, we continued to text every day but i would get emotional if there was a day he didn\u2019t text me or I felt like he was not reciprocating the same energy or affection I was putting into things. \n\n2 days ago we got into an argument bc he started acting cold and annoyed with me again. He decided to end things with me. We agreed to still be friends but that we wouldn\u2019t see eachother or talk as much. Maybe if he moved back home. But he didn\u2019t want me to wait for him anymore. I\u2019m so hurt over this because I feel like I lost a best friend but I know it was my fault and I lost a good thing that was perfect for what I needed in my life right now. Part of me feels like i wasn\u2019t allowed to get mad because we were not officially together. But part of me is sooo hurt and mad at him because i feel like he led me on and treated me like more when he knew i was invested and cared for him deeply (which i told him all the time). \n\nWas he just using me or did he care?

Also, thanks for the upvotes I really didn't expect it to blow up like how it did (I gained like 800 karma in one day). And thanks to the person who gave me the award.\n\nNow to the story you have all been waiting for. It's a good read, trust me.\n\nI woke up early from my anticipation, to her it was just any other Sunday (or so she thought) and she woke up at her normal time. I had about two hours in the morning by myself and I was able to check Reddit and find out that my post had blew up.\n\nBefore she woke up, I made us her favorite breakfast: fruit salad with eggs benedict. I plated the food and waited for the shower water to stop running, indicating that she was gonna come out soon. When she came out and saw the breakfast, she instantly lit up and gave me a kiss. Afterwards, we went to get some work done. I was too nervous to be productive so I was on Reddit answering comments lol. But anywho, 7 o clock rolls around and I suggest we go on a walk. She was still in a good mood from the breakfast and happily agreed. She asked where we should go and I said I have an idea, and suggested the secret tiny clearing in the forest: the place where we had our first kiss and where I was gonna propose to her. She started getting all lovey dovey and telling me how cute I was, all the while the ring box was in my pocket, pressed against my leg. We get there and for a moment we are silent: just enjoying each other and the memories we had in this small haven hidden from the rest of the world. And then I start my speech. I talk about the time I met her, how I realized she was an incredible person immediately and wanted her in my life forever. I wasn't sure what our relationship was gonna be, but I just knew I needed her. I talked about how much I cherished our friendship and how grateful I was/am for her healing me in my dark times and helping me mature. I talk about how much we have grown and achieved as a pair, and all the memories we have made. I tell her that she's means the world to me, and even a bit more after that. I tell her that she is my definition of love. By now she is crying and I am holding back my tears too. I tell her that there is still one thing to say, and she asks me what. I pull out the ring and get down on one knee. And in the exact spot where we had our first kiss and where I asked her to be my girlfriend, I ask her to marry me. \"Let's go on an adventure, forever\". Tears cascade down the face of the woman I love more than myself. Through her happy sobs and emotions, she manages to say yes. Euphoria. Utopia. Joy. Everything. After crying into each other's shoulders, we sit down and look out onto the valley at the edge of the clearing, enjoying the evening air now charged with electric love. Sitting next to each other, our hands touch. Neither of us move our hand. We look at each other, and kiss.\n\nNOW THIS IS THE PART I DIDNT EXPECT\n\nWe go home, and after drinking some water she goes to our bedroom (I assume to change) and I go to pour some red wine. She comes out(btw her face is still wet with happy tears) and she has her hands behind her back. I chuckle and ask her what she's hiding. She says \"oh nothing, just my infinite love for you\". She then gives me this small speech/emotional monologue that is both happy and tearfully happy at the same time. She talks about how proud she is of my growth as a man and the growth of our relationship. She finally brings her hands out to reveal a small blue box and GETS ON ONE KNEE AND PROPOSES TO ME. Surprised isn't a strong enough word for how I felt. I had just proposed to her less than an hour ago and now she is doing the same thing in the kitchen of the home we worked so hard to build. Of course, her proposal is more of a fun and lighthearted one because we are smiling instead of bawling our eyes out. I of course say yes and allow her to put on the beautiful gold ring. She knew I wanted to propose as I said in passing comments that it was a huge dream of mine, I'm glad she let me do mine first before doing hers.\n\nAfterwards we went to bed and cuddled, talked, cried, did the deed, cuddled a bit more, talked a bit more, cried a bit more, and fell asleep. My future wife and I have practically been in each other's arms for the past 20 hours. She is in the shower right now so I thought I would use this time to write this post.\n\nThank you guys for following me on this whole thing.\n\nI plan on leaving these posts here because I might just turn this Reddit account into some type of Ejournal of our relationship. Also you guys really enjoyed my storytelling, should I write more posts of the adventures we had?

I put my feelings aside, it sounds dumb but lets say i locked my feelings for her in my brain and those feelings eventually exploded, so i didnt confess to her but she knew again that i didn't give up and we talked a lot and since that day i really was like a new man!

I say thats bullpoop, i can see right through her, and i know that she has some small feelings for him deep down there.

In short, it was a rebound relationship for both of us, we had sex, it was my first time, and then he said he couldn't love me. I was depressed for a long time.\n\nAround this time, I had to come back home due to Coronavirus, and my depression continued. At first, I spoke to my parents, but then I could see that I was beginning to stress them out. They really tried to help me, they used to take my on walks, spend a lot of time with me. \n\nI was taking online classes, but I began to delve into the world of psychics through Instagram as I had free time. There, I would ask for readings. From multiple people, it became an addiction. Do you think I'm meant to be with this person? Why aren't things working out. Why am I being rejected? And then I met a person from Florida, who said she would work with me. At first, I didn't believe her, but once she did some sort of ritual, and he actually called me. Although, hung up after the first two rings, so never got to talk to him. When I asked her if I should call back, she said no hun not yet. I was amazed. I'm a medical student, and I am usually a very logical individual. Then she told me we had to work with figurines, and that it would cost $1200. I had just gotten my loan money, so I said what the heck, why not. I sent it over. By this time, all the money I had spent on readings and the like had grown close to $4000-5000 already. \n\nMy parents check up on my bank accounts, and they saw all of my transaction history. They were outraged; how can you believe a psychic, are you crazy, have you gone insane? We talked about it, I explained myself, and the issue was resolved, but I was still in touch with the psychic, and she said we needed something stronger like a tabernacle, and that was going to cost $800. This time, I was really not sure what to do. In the end, I sent the money. There are people in so much trouble in the world during this time and here I am spending money like its nothing. I'm so selfish. \n\nThey found out again, even after I had changed my password to my bank account. My mom started crying, she made us go get an HIV test from Wallgreens because I finally told her I had had sex, none of us slept the entire night. \n\nGuys, I keep hurting them. I feel that they are ashamed that I am their daughter. I am ashamed at myself, for being so loose, having sex so quickly with someone and instead of dealing with it in a private manner, I told a bunch of people in desperation, and now my self-respect and any love my parents had on me are gone. We come from a pretty conservative Indian family if that provides any context. \n\nOther people seem to be in stable relationships and do fine, some of my friends are getting married. All I wanted was to find my someone. But, this had ended up being such a disaster. \n\nI wish they would scold me, or even hit me, but they are being so nice and understanding.", "title": "Dear people of Reddit"}, {"created_utc": 1591032943, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/guoysj/craving_for_intimacy/", "num_comments": 5, "score": 4, "selftext": "Hey guys and girls...\nSo I have this theory about myself.\nI (M20) don't have a girlfriend. I never had, apart from this one week when I was 16. I loved her but she decided she \"didn't love me, but just liked me a lot\". So far so good, I got over it. Learned some things that I want to do different next time. But there wasn't a next time (now 4 1/2 years ago).\nDuring that time I had one big crush where I would consider myself being in love. But it didn't work out she just wanted to be friends, which was fine and I respected that and in fact we are still good friends and I'm really cool with it. Some few other crushes but nothing that evolved to anything serious. So much for that.\nI am happy. I would describe myself as a pretty confident guy. I have many friends and a few really good ones. I'm successful at university so far and made friends there quite well.  Sure I'm not perfect at all, but overall, I am happy.\nYou know and then there just are these sudden occasions that I just WANT someone to be with me as a girlfriend, sometimes for example when I see a happy couple out in the park or so. And I feel so \nI thought a lot about why I even want (and need?) a girlfriend at all.\n\nAnd my major reflection is that I am lacking intimacy. Like physical intimacy. Not particularly sexual but also. And I just can't find another place to find it other than in a relationship.\nI often reflect about that and I perceived that I'm quite weirdly sensitive to physical touch. If a friend or someone from my family hugs me or whatever it's fine. But if a girl that even remotely potentially is a candidate to be a partner (even if I don't like her and especially with girls I like) and touches me or more precise starts being physically close to me, I feel really uncomfortable and I'll back out. Which makes me literally unable to act in situations I get close with girls I like. And believe me I had a few of these occasions but I just didn't know what to do at all and felt uncomfortable so I did nothing. And nothing happened. Missed opportunity. Again and again.\n\nSome people people might say just get a one night stand or get a friend with benefits but I can't do that.\nI have quite high standards of how I want to live a potential relationship e.g. definitely aiming for something long-term and really respecting each other and being equal. So one night stands are a no go for me and I'd probably be way too nervous anyway and furthermore be even more craving for that intimacy which would last so shortly. Just like porn which I turn to when the feelings hit hard and I'm on my own...\n\nTl;dr: I want intimacy, because I feel like I need it. I feel like I need it because I don't have have it. And I don't have it because it makes me uncomfortable. And it makes me uncomfortable because I don't have it and never had it. But I feel like I need it and therefore I want it. Running in circles.\n\nWhen I think and reflect about these things, I feel weirdly strange to myself. What person am I actually? Am I just overthinking everything? Do I want the wrong things? Do I have the wrong standards? Will I ever be able to learn to be intimate when I back out all the time?\nI just want someone that doesn't think I'm a weirdo when I look at her or touch her... Or make me feel a weirdo... But maybe it's me that makes me feel a weirdo...\nSome general questions\nDoes love without physical intimacy work (for me)? Or is it a basic need that I need to satisfy? \n\nGosh...

It was the type of nervousness you get before going on a field trip back in elementary school: so not the worst thing in the world. The day of, I drank several Poland Springs of water because of a headache I was trying to dull.\n\nWhile in her room taking the test, I felt this incredible urge to pee. It was a live-proctored exam and one of the rules said that I was not allowed to leave to use the restroom.

I tried deep-breathing techniques. I tried focusing more on the test. And I tried thinking of your naked grandma. None of it worked. At my bursting point, I dropped my pants (it was under the table I was sitting at so the proctor couldn't see), and I peed out enough water to quench the fires in Hell.\n\nAfterwards, I finished the exam and immediately went to clean up my mess. I grabbed paper towels by the dozen and disinfected the shit out of her floor and everything that the piss could have reasonably touched.\n\nIn case you were wondering, my girlfriend was at work while all of this was happening. When she was on break, I called her, told her what happened, told her about how I cleaned it up, and apologized profusely for what happened. I could have kept it to myself, but I figured that it is only fair for her to know what happened in her house. Also, in case I fucked up and missed a spot, I would want this conversation to come *before* the piss investigation, rather than after.\n\nBefore she got back, I wrote a letter telling her how much I loved her and apologized again for peeing all over her floor. I also told her that I would consider taking all future exams in a bathroom. \n\nShe was pissed that I allowed myself to be distracted by holding in my piss for 30 minutes and wished that I would have let it out sooner.\n\nI have never loved anyone as much as I loved my GF in that moment, and every moment before, after and forever.", "title": "Being cool with you partner peeing on your floor is the truest declaration of love"}, {"created_utc": 1590966593, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gu94f3/the_girl_that_i_love_fell_in_love_with_my_best/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "The girl that I love fell in love with my best friend"}, {"created_utc": 1590962004, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gu7tac/ill_marry_the_person_that_can_go_to_a_family/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 3, "selftext": "", "title": "I\u2019ll marry the person that can go to a family event with me and still like me afterwards."}, {"created_utc": 1590961686, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gu7pwj/people_are_good_1/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[https://youtu.be/OS3HHFvOmIM](https://youtu.be/OS3HHFvOmIM)", "title": "People are GOOD #1"}, {"created_utc": 1590957472, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gu6hsq/when_is_it_okay_to_text_after_a_date/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[deleted]", "title": "When is it okay to text after a date?"}, {"created_utc": 1590956738, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gu69t3/my_girlfriend_is_amazing/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 3, "selftext": "My girlfriend is so beautiful.

I feel less motivated and driven to do stuff. What is the point? I do like what I'm studying, my voluntary work and friends but, without that love, everything else seems meaningless. I work so hard on a daily basis trying to better everything around me and I get dealt such a hand. Maybe, it's my fault. I don't want to sound entitled because, I don't feel I am but, It's just that all that I am and do isn't enough for love. \n\nSorry, for the depressing post but, I'd like to know what is your take on this.", "title": "At odds with love"}, {"created_utc": 1584301410, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fj76pi/how_do_you_know_if_a_girl_has_a_crush_on_you_on/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "How do you know if a girl has a crush on you on snapchat?

I thought I loved her but I think I was just more attached to the idea that she sometimes told me she loved me and meant it, nobody ever really loves me before or told me at least. Then I finally got the courage to end it and I felt like I was free but I also found incredibly lonely. I was happy but in a different ways. I met a few girls after but they all used me or ghosted me. So I made a tinder with the intent to make a real connection( I know it\u2019s not for that) I told myself if I didn\u2019t have any luck in a reasonable amount of time I\u2019d give up and if I got any bites I\u2019d stay on it longer until there was no more progress. I was about to give up on love for a very long time and delete the app when someone super liked me, a girl from my area that I recognized. I tried to wait a little bit and play it cool but I couldn\u2019t help myself so I messaged her. Turns out she liked me on accident. But she talked to me either way.. she seemed to open up to me. we texted and snap chatted. Then I picked her up one evening to go to a mutual friends house. Sparks didn\u2019t seem to fly but I took it as she just wasn\u2019t into me. she expressed she had no intentions of being more than friends. So I kept on that way. Then it seemed obvious she kinda wanted more but wouldn\u2019t admit it.  I asked her a couple times to be my girlfriend and she always declined. She\u2019d occasionally slip up and call me her boyfriend or \u201cjoke\u201d about it. this went on for two months ish. Then she asked me to go with her on a last minute vacation and it was amazing but the first night in the hotel she sat me down and told me she didn\u2019t love me and probably wouldn\u2019t. But she cared for me. I acted like I was okay and just tried to enjoy the trip. that September on the anniversary of my dads death she took off work and spent all day with me because she knew I\u2019d just spend it alone and not see anyone. we went to breakfast and to the cemetery then watched a movie.

I hope you like cuddles, 'cause that's something I want to do with you lots. \n\nI think your curly hair is really soft, I'd like to play with it when you lay your head on my lap.

Your smile makes me smile too, your dimples are what I like best.\n\nThey are so many things I've only dreamed of doing with you, too much to list on a single post. We'll dance to cheesy love songs in the dining room of a studio apartment when we're not that rich yet (only in money, of course, we're rich in everything else when we have each other), you'll take my hand and I'll rest my head on your chest.

And we'll sit in libraries with our sides pressed together with good books to read.\n\nTo the ends of the world we'll go, to lagoons and caves, to mountains and rivers. We'll travel everywhere together, learning about the different cultures and the people of the countries. \n\nWe'll sing songs so terribly off tune, blankets as capes and hairbrushes as microphones.

You are my third love. \n\nI have thought about this a lot and I really am sure that every time I've loved someone I've loved them with the same intensity... because it's who I am. It's either all of my heart or none of it, I don't play games.\n\nAnd still, despite the equal intensity, each time was a little...more refined, or more well rounded than the time before. I've come to believe that, just like any other life skill, loving is something we can all get better at. It's a skill we can hone until, ideally, we master it. A master of love is the person who loves without smothering her loved one, without clinging too tightly, squeezing too hard. It's someone who can truly handle love, experience love without spoiling it, and, just as importantly, without hurting themselves in the process.\n\nAnd you see, with you, there have been times when I felt I was almost there. That I had almost figured it out. As our relationship evolved and we reached familiar milestones such as becoming official, meeting eachother's families, discovering the other's pet peeves, telling eachother the really dark stuff we've been through, and about how we survived, and about how we deal with the scars, the secrets we haven't shared with anyone else...well all that made me feel confident that you and I had met at exactly the right time: the time when we are both exactly on the same page, emotionally strong enough to put in the work that love requires. I had started to believe that the personal growth I acquired through my past relationships and the periods of time when I was single meant that this time around, with you as the most perfect team mate I've ever had, we could make it last.\n\nAnd so far I haven't been wrong. We are still a team. But our bond is being tested over and over. Little things that accumulate, that seem harmless at first but then turn out to be real threats. It is messing with the synchronicity we once had. There was a time when I felt so fiercely proud of us every time we had an argument. I felt so proud at how we communicated, of the level of communication and respect we had for eachother. There was a time when by the time an argument ended, I'd feel an overwhelming sense of triumph at how we had handled it; the fact that we were coming out at the other end more united than before. \n\nBut our lives have changed somewhat. There are new stress factors that weren't there before. My mental health is crumbling, yours is in similar condition. This new year has brought us nothing but stressful situations, worry, uncertainty. And it's only the beginning, more changes are coming our way. We are both scared shitless, to the point that neither is capable of being there for the other without sinking deeper for it. And it's beginning to affect the core of who we are as a team. I am no longer so sure I was as near to mastering love as I had come to believe, or even if there's a chance I'll ever get there in my lifetime. I can feel myself hurting you, simply by being so transparent about all my doubts, by being depressed and feeling so inadequate, and unworthy, all the time. \nI just don't feel like I have my shit together, I don't feel like I can do right by you... On the worst nights I just want to be someone else. Someone who doesn't remember what it is to love you. Someone who isn't so worried that she won't deliver.\n\nSometimes I want to be on my own again just so I can work on these things again, without the danger of hurting you in the process...but if I do that, if I ask you for time, and space, will I lose you?\n\nI think I would. Someone else would notice how great you are and run off with you. So I don't know what to do.

It was all by accident when he replied to my tweet to correct me about what nihilism is. I've never met him like.. in person but we got to know each other on the internet and then became friends (i guess). After some time it started to turn into something more. It wasn't love but a sexual tension. And after all of this, one day, he just stopped texting me and blocked me. I was really sad and angry about him leaving me but more because he wanted to just run away without saying anything. I would of course respect his decision but I was angry that he didn't want to tell me about it earlier. I thought we were friends.\n\nSome time passed and I forgot about him but still really liked all of these memories about us. I forgave him all of the stuff he did and still respected him as a person because he was really wise and special to me.\nIdk when (probably around this time when we were still texting each other) I added him to my close friends on instagram and forgot about it. So one day, after many years of silence, he texted me to ask if we're close friends. He said he doesn't feel like it because he was toxic back then. We said sorry about everything and then he asked me how my life's going. So I said something like \"nothing new\" BUT he sent me a whole story about him living his best life now and how happy he is. Idk why but he also said he has two girlfriends cause he goes polyamory. In this moment he texted me with this question I felt really bad, I thought I would have a panic attack. He's still arousing strong emotions in me.\n\nAnd after all of these I became very sad and suicidal. I was thinking that my existence has always been pointless but at least I was enjoying some things in life but now it's all gone. I couldn't sleep properly and eat anything. It was that hard to eat that one day I was near to faint. Normally I would start panicking and go and eat anything but that time I just went to bad to wait for death calmly (I know I was overreacting but I was feeling really, really bad that time). At some point I started feeling really calm and every time I was driving or walking somewhere I was constantly thinking about my death and how normal it would be to die here and now. I felt calm in the face of a potential accident and it was a feeling I will never forget - no fear of death.\n\nThe problem is if I should do anything about it. If I should tell him about my feelings or just block him everywhere and try not to think about him? (yes, i know about the pink elephant, it will be hard). I think the whole point is about his nature - he is way more smarter then me, I didn't get him sometimes and this is why he's so exciting to spend time with! I want to get to know him better and better. He's so special and interesting, I want to read him like a book, do you understand me? I'm afraid I will never meet someone that special (it's not true, I know) but I don't want anyone else (and this is why I think it's love). But isn't it the only feature of him I know? Wisdom? Or more like thought? \n\nHe has his girlfriends and happy life so I don't want to go there and say \"hello, imma whole new problem for you!\" but at the same time I want to be close to him. Every time I read some philosophy book I can't help but to think about him and this is very annoying. I know I'm very sensitive and romantic and I feel full when emotions run my life - I feel it's very spontaneous and real. I'm probably more \"i feel\" kind of person than \"i think\" person. \n\nSo what should I do in your opinion?

I told her we couldn't be together because we didn't have the same emotional requirements, I lived far from her and because of college I couldn't travel that easily, and I didn't wanted to disappoint her in that time. I must accept she tried to dealt with that situation, or at least that's what she showed me, because casually, shit started happening to her life, and with total security I can confirm right now she putted herself into risky and emotionally harming situations to catch my attention and my empathy. \n\nAnd it worked.\n\nI supported her as much as someone can support a loved one. And of course we started dating. Everything seemed perfect for a couple of mounts but distance started to resonate in our relationship. At first there were little things, little instructions which I didn't even noticed I had to follow, I mean, it seemed normal. Maybe I was with my friends and they planned to stay at my house to spend the night, and she started asking me to tell them to go early in the morning, because I had to clean or whatever, with the excuse of \"having something important to talk about with me\". Then she asked me to tell my buddies that they couldn't spend the night with me, and restrictions continued until I was hanging with my bros twice a month or less, it obviously took months to get there. It seemed so... Natural, so organic. She made me feel that I wasn't taking the compromise of the relationship as seriously as her, she didn't even seemed angry, just, sad, and she constantly remembered me how miserable her life was because of the risky situations I wrote before.\n\nThen, she started being aggressive.\n\nShe started threatening me with hanging with other guys if I didn't upload photos with her to facebook, she called me crying and screaming because I posted something she didn't approve, she made me sleep bad in days in which she knew I had to wake up early, or calling me when I was already asleep. She made me put our photograph in every profile picture, in every social media I had. She of course did the same, and started using it as a weapon. Now when she was disappointed, she posted a photo of her and someone else as her profile picture so I got jealous. And as a fucking Pavlov's Dog, I got conditioned to all that crap. I started a masters after I finished college and she wasn't in agreement, she wanted to have a Baby so she can move from her house, she hate her parents (and they are actually wonderful people), and I practically beg her to stay with me until I finished my masters, and then we will have the baby. She apparently \"agreed\", but a couple of months later she got pregnant. \n\nIt happened in one of my trips to my hometown. She wanted to have unprotected sex, and I told her to wear condom. She treated me in a very mean way. I told her at least to take a pill and she told me she will, I gave her money and everything. She told me she took it, but it didn't worked. And I fucking believed her.\n\nDon't misunderstand me fellas, its hard to work for money to sustain a family, but I don't mind it. I told her I would do whatever for her and my baby, and then the fucking real thing started. \n\nShe abusively tried to separate me from everything, now she thinks she has complete power about me and my actions and its getting over me.\n\nI hate my fucking job, but I can't find a New one because I have all this fucking crap in my mind everytime.

She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say\u00a0boo.She\u00a0began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We\u2019d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends\u00a0help.When\u00a0I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said \"Nobody else is as big as you\". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.\n\nAs I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. She had her boss send me a coupon for the restaurant that she worked at.  I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught. then kept getting in the way when we'd walk through and one time got in the way and bent over the supervisor said something.\n\nWe went to the same college briefly andshe saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me showed up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside.  I saw her in a store and saw her walk in when I was in line because I looked back when she came in. I immediately looked away and when she got behind me in line and I was leaving she said hi to me in the saddest tone. She got a boyfriend over a year ago. Well I saw her at the store 6 months ago and she said hi then when I held the door open for her said \"oh thank youuuuuu\" in a tone and I think she was being sarcastic. Well recently I blocked her on FB and waited 2 weeks. I unblocked her sent her a message explaining I didn't like her in that way and she made me uncomfortable telling her I want nothing to do with her only had platonic feelings. Well she blocked me on FB. I've known her for 5 years \n\nPS she's known for being a pig and a huge flirt that will try to get with anyone. She'll try to get with her best friend's dad.", "title": "Why did she block me once I told her to stop"}, {"created_utc": 1584149580, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fiasmb/i_miss_my_boyfriend/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "\nI miss my boyfriend a lot.

What could go wrong? After all, they know you better than anyone, and you know the better than anyone too. \n\nSo you decide to just tell them. I mean, the spark is obvious, so this is the logical move.\n\nThat's exactly where everything deteriorates. \n\nYou start the conversation, start building up to it, that fateful reveal, and then you say it. Sounds good so far. She opens her mouth, out of it come crushing down the words you wished to never hear. She says that the feeling isn't mutual. She tries to explain herself. You pretend to be fine. You tell her it doesn't hurt. You tell her it's okay. You promise nothing will change between you two, your feelings won't get in the way of the friendship. \n\nYou get home. Open the door. Once inside, door closed, you crumble. You transform into an absolute mess. You wonder why, what did you do wrong. You ask yourself why can't she see the spark. Why doesn't she reciprocate? All those questions weigh heavy on your mind for weeks. You try to move on. Every time you try, it hurts more than the last. Each time you see her, you fall deeper in love with her. Her smile lifts you to territories unknown to you. You get lost in her eyes each time. You try to get rid of those awful feelings but they won't leave. You hate yourself for allowing them to creep in, to settle in. \n\nYou lose hope, your will deteriorates. \n\nYou lay at night, in bed, just you and those never ending thoughts, her words constantly echoing in your mind, cutting deeper and deeper with each passing day.

You console her when she gets heartbroken, listening to her relationship problems, you try to help her find the person for her, because you know she deserves someone who will love her for the rest of her life, and that she loves too.

I\u2019ve addressed this to my husband, but sex basically doesn\u2019t exist for the both of us. I\u2019ve actually found myself getting less and less attracted to him. (It was expressed as well)\n\nI think I\u2019ve always had this \u201cfeeling\u201d of somewhat regretting getting married young (I was 20). But now recently, I met online someone by accident who I now have an interest in. By accident, I mean, I play an online game and we became friends and ended up clicking. This person does know that I am married and respects my relationship as well, but has admitted his feelings for me. I am currently stationed on the east coast, but I\u2019m originally from California. I took a trip home to be home for my \u201cfriends birthday\u201d, but I ended up meeting my online friend because he actually lives near my hometown. We ate breakfast and hung out, and we both agreed there was definitely something there and now I\u2019m confused.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to little family and friends about the issue because of how sensitive it is. My mom actually told me never really saw myself and I as a \u201cmarried couple\u201d because of how things are between us.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just looking for anyone with this type of experience because I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m trying to work on things with my husband, but I honestly don\u2019t feel the same way that I do, and he\u2019s starting to look less like a husband to me.", "title": "Young &amp; married"}, {"created_utc": 1604271383, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/jmbz34/soulmates/", "num_comments": 7, "score": 1, "selftext": "Do you believe in soulmates?

I felt like it was 1 second longer than people usually do it. I stared at you for 3 long seconds. On the beach you brought the best in me. You were the first person to get so many words out of my mouth. I never talked so much in my life. I have never said such retarded and funny jokes. That holiday was something so special. Just the two of us and the full moon by the beach rising in the middle of the night. You, watching me write my astronomy stuff and sharing so much amazing music. We have such similar music tastes that it's scary. It was magical. It was something else, that we had offered to each other. On the last night, when we kissed, it was the moment I finally shut up for 2 hours straight. We stared at each other. The best kisses I've ever had, I swear. As we walked the next morning to our hotel rooms, I remember that a friend of my mom's asked me something, but I was so mesmerized by you that I couldn't hear what she was asking me. When she repeated that question I was still staring at you and you were still staring at me and I hardly broke this hypnotic eye contact. Then you left back home. The image of your beautiful face staring peacefully on the beach, those beautiful eyes that really looked at me and the sound of the waves sticked in my head and were too overwhelming for me when you left. I was emotional, especially on the day you left. I tried to keep myself together while sitting at the dining table, I shed a few unnoticable tears and I couldn't eat. The thought of you, this feeling made me nauseous for a month each time I had to eat. On my way back to the hotel I stopped by the beach, by the place we used to sit together and I balled my eyes out, half a toilet paper roll. We were going to meet each other again, but the feeling that you gave me was too intense.\nI love it that we could just cuddle and sleep when we were tired, that everything felt so relaxing, as if we knew each other for such a long time, or in another life. Everything felt so easy when we hung around. I have to confess you something. I thought you were seeing someone else at that time. It shouldn't have mattered that much because we weren't in a relationship, but when I took that conclusion, I couldn't do anything for a whole day. I was jealous. I thought I was not the jealous, selfish type.. But I wanted you all to myself. Only mine. I wanted you to only kiss my lips and to only play that way with my hair. Of course I didn't tell you anything because I keep these things to myself and am very understandable, but god, I was angry. I realised that I love you. I love you. I love you and I wanted you to tell me right away what do you want from me! It was so painful. Something that before I couldn't understand. I am such a patient person but I wanted you to choose right away whether you're mine or you'll never see me again. I wouldn't have wanted to hear about, nor to see you. \nAfter a month, when I finally asked if you wanted to be mine, you said you'll think about that. You said you haven't had seen anyone else. It made me optimistic, it made my heart turn gold. \n\nToday you said that you can't do it. I said \"okay\" and you asked \"just okay?\" well, \"yeah, I don't want to force you to do anything if you don't feel it# and you appreciated it. I think it concluded to us being what we were until now. After a few minutes of cuddling my zen was interrupted by a voice in my head that almost broke my ears: &gt;if you don't feel it&lt; me to myself:\" wait, so that means that you don't love me the way I do.\" \nMy eyes started watering, shit, I couldn't show that and I didn't want my nose to be all stuffy. I swiped one tear after another, pretending to do my hair or something, but I missed a tear and I think you felt it on your head. You took my head and kissed my eyes for fucking christ. I tried to convince you I have an allergy, which I think it kinda worked until you kissed me. My eyes got a bit watery, but my mouth. My mouth.. When I felt your lips.. When I felt your warm lips, dear, my mouth started shaking and I pushed you away. I didn't burst out but it was close. I will never forget the moment you kissed me and the way I felt. Explosive. I don't know if I'll be able to kiss you and not feel my heart broken or cry every again. I want to kiss you and I want to cry while kissing you. I want to feel this beautiful and painful feeling of love in my whole body. I want to kiss you until the end of times with passion and to give you all the love that my mind, body and soul has to offer. I am still in shock, I can't believe this thing happened. I can't believe that I am heartbroken, I can't believe this day existed. \nBut I am going to keep it cool, perhaps send you this some day when we are old. I feel like I did the right thing, I don't want to have anyone feel trapped, you know?

I'm so greatfull I was given a small glimpse of what it feels like to love and be loved, what a wonderful feeling. But now I feel like I have no options and no one to talk to about it without them freaking out.\n\nMy thinking is getting morbid shit like broadcasting the end of my life on the darkweb\n\nIt took me a long time to get to where I am today overcame alot of adversity in my life. Mom commiting suicide, living in foster homes, childhood abuse, living on the streets, drug addiction. Because of these experiences my priority was always success ... My version of success at that time looked like owning my own home and having a good job. It took some work to get there but I finally got my degree at the age of 35, I am now 44 I own my own home and have a good job. When I meet her I realized she's not just some girl she's the love of my life, it also became clear to me my priorities have been fucked up. The relationships one makes in life are the most important, nothing else. I finally felt happy, truley happy for the first time in my life.\n\nIt's been an uphill battle for most of my life. I finally thought it's going to be smooth sailing from here; or at least I'll have someone by my side giving me the strength to continue the battle that is life. But she's not here and I'm just tired. I kept texting her and she said please just give me until the weekend to process my emotions and see how I feel, I'll respond on the weekend. The optimist in me says she just needs time. The realist in me already knows her answer. There is a part of me telling me just wait until the weekend before making any drastic life choices. There is another part of me that's saying fuck it just get really fucked up and do it; man up.\n\nI Keep thinking about our plans for the future together. How she wanted to decorate our home, how many children we were going to have; I said 12, hehe, the names of our children, how we would cook together, how I would pinch her ass when the kids weren't looking. We would always tell eachother how much we love the other, never sleep in seperate beds after a fight or argument, how we would grow old together, how I would chase her around the house when we're old and I have a walking cane. This all seems a distant memory now. If only had learned earlier in my life that true happiness comes from the loving relationships one builds in their life. Those relationships require consistent effort to nurture by being honest, open and vulnerable in your communication. Yes I realize what I'm feeling is temporary. The hurt that I feel will pass, I will forget about the plans we made. Work will once again take priority in my life... What is the point of life without love and family? I don't want to forget, that would be worse. Will it be a happy ending or a sad one still remains to be seen.

But he\u2019s my best friend and everything I do is better when I\u2019m doing it with him. OKAY with that here\u2019s the story:\n\n\n\n2015. On a semi-whim I agree to meet a friend of mine from college (we studied Classics together in Rome) back in Rome for a month. It was supposed to be a chance to hang out, drink a bunch of wine and close off our early 20s. I was 24. \n\nI fly from Cleveland to Boston to then fly to Dublin and, finally, Rome. (I\u2019m cheap. Whatever). \nThe Boston airport was deserted. I grew up in New England and I\u2019ve never seen Logan so empty. But I grab a seat and watch my phone while I wait for my plane. \nThis woman (70ish) sits next to me. In a deserted airport with a million seats, she sits next to me. \n\nShe strikes up a conversation and tells me her husband of many decades died recently. They loved to travel together and see the world, so now she\u2019s trying to travel kind of in his memory. She tells me how lucky she was to have a partner to travel with, a best friend. She asks me if I have a boy. I say no, and she tells me that when I do find someone, it should be a person I want to spend every waking moment with, someone who will be my best friend through life. She tells me I\u2019ll probably find him soon. \n\nJump forward about 3 weeks and my friend\u2019s college friends (whom I\u2019ve never met) come to visit for a week or so in Rome. One of the men is really cute and nice and smart as all hell. He does not like me because I\u2019m partying all the time. I do not like him because he\u2019s stuck up (I thought). \n\nOne night we all go out and he and I get close and kiss. Super nice but I freak out. I worry about ruining my friendship with my study abroad friend and I try to ignore him the rest of the trip. \n\nA few days later I\u2019m sitting at a bar drinking wine and the woman\u2019s words come into my head. Suddenly, like a damn train, the realization hits me: this is the guy I need to be with. He\u2019s smart, he\u2019s funny, he\u2019s a great friend, he speaks 4 languages (ugh I know, right?) and, above all else, I just KNOW. I don\u2019t know how I know, but i know. \n\nSo, like the super dramatic person I am, I run back from the bar outside the Pantheon to our shared apartment in Trastevere, I sit on his bed and I tell him we need to be together. \n\nHe agrees\n\nWithin 2 months I\u2019ve gotten a job (that\u2019s an advancement in my career) near him, several states away from Ohio. We move in. We get engaged. He becomes best friends with my dad. My mom makes him stews and knits him socks in the winter.

But I love her so much, I won't ever let her down.\n\nThe problem is, she has a very hard life. Her parents (mother side) were adopted, her mom is a very toxic mom, her father has health issues and there are still horrible things I can't really tell here. All this hard life makes her have some psychologic problems, she is very bipolar, her crazy mom might gave her some mental issues. She often insult me, makes big mistakes, but I will always forgive her as I know she will be back to normal in a few hours. When she is herself, she is just so cute, so adorable, I often cry for her because she is too beautiful, I can't understand why I, a shy looser, can have such a beautiful person in my life. I always try to comfort her via vocal when she is not alright, but I'm so weak even though I love her above everything, words are not enough, hugs, kisses are how to comfort and make her feel comfortable. I can't really comfort her when I'm not with her in real life, that really hurt me, that makes me depressive and have some weird ideas... I see her suffer everything because of her hard life, and I can't do anything, and as a very protective boyfriend, that hurt me so much...\n\nM, if you see this, don't forget our irl times. They are the bests and the only true moments of our relationship.

They think of unconditional admiration, adoration, and infatuation with every detail they discover. They think of the redness in their cheeks as their thoughts get jumbled with each kiss. This is the love people fall into as they begin a relationship, the thrill of the new, of all the places they haven\u2019t explored together and the possibilities of the journey they will take. Yes, this is a type of love, the new love, but not the kind made to last. This is the honeymoon phase, the gushing and slightly overbearing affection that people portray as the desired standard for companionship.\n\nBut this, I believe, is not sustainable. \n\nLong-lasting love doesn\u2019t make your heart race, or your thoughts clouded. It doesn\u2019t rely on perfection, shattering at the smallest crack in the illusion of the ideal partner. Long-lasting love is comfortable. When new love ends, comfortable love begins. Comfortable love is your overwhelming emotions settling when you see your partner\u2019s face. It is the safety you feel when you\u2019re in their embrace. It is the serenity in simply existing by their side. Comfortable love is peaceful. Comfortable love is calm. But comfortable love is not always possible. \n\nWhen the thrill of the new has dissipated, when the dust settles and the journey becomes clear, often times the love falls away as well. Your relationship is no longer the headline in conversation. There are far fewer discoveries to make, fewer uncharted paths to pave. It is here when love begins to rely on experiences and effort over exploration and emotion. New love is easy. Comfortable love is work.

I was 17 at the time, did not want to finish high-school, and spent most of my time playing video games. I didn't get out much and after quiting school, I lost most of my friends. I definitely was subconscious about my weight, but it was nothing a large jacket couldn't fix. I would look in the mirror and think that I looked pretty decent. A good friend of mine wanted to hang out and suggested we go to a high-school game. I went and met a few of my old friends and talked to a girl that I knew of, but never really talked to. We exchanged numbers and I thought that I would be able to make a good friend.\n\n      I always had to send the first text to start a conversation with people and I never had a problem with that. She was in a relationship, so I never thought about her being more than a friend. After awhile, we began texting more and she even started texting me first. We became really good friends and I started to get jealous of her boyfriend, but I didn't know why. I was always the friend and I never had a problem with that. As our friendship grew, the more she would tell me about her relationship. I began to learn that she was in an awful relationship that was on and off again because he was cheating on her. I always told her how sorry I was, but really had nothing to offer.\n\n     Her boyfriend never minded that she had a friend like me because she would never go for a guy like me. She told me this multiple times and I would just agree. They broke up about 5 months in to our friendship and she wanted to go hangout like we did \nPeriodically. It was about 95 degrees out and I had a large hoodie on to cover up my size. I was never asked the question until she looked at me and asked while I was wearing a jacket when it was so hot out. I shook it off and just said that I loved this Hoodie and always wore it. She accepted that answer and we went upon our night.\n\n     We ended up starting to call each other and would talk to each other every second of the day. She started dropping subtle hints about liking me and I would always ignore them. Her hints started to become more apparent and I ended up talking to her a lot less than usual. I started looking in the mirror and feeling disgusted with what I saw and knew that I needed to change. I ended up focusing more on myself and stopped hanging out with her all together. I went from 300 pounds to about 260 before I started feeling confident in my body. After a few month of working on myself, I invited her to a party that my parents were having.  After an amazing night, I finally asked her to be my girlfriend and unbelievably she said yes.\n\n      I was very shy and anywhere that we went, I would always bring my friend along. She was always a great sport about it and just loved spending time with me. As our relationship went on the more confident I was getting. At about three weeks of dating, she told me that her mother thought I could be gay because I have not kissed her. I never even thought about kissing her! I was so happy talking to her, that I forgot about the other parts that come along with dating. I took her to a movie for our one month anniversary and while dropping her off, she hopped out of the car and told me goodnight. I told her to wait and asked if I could kiss her. We kissed and then she went inside.\n\n    After a while of dating, around the five month mark, she told me that she loved me and I immediately said it back. I was still in shock that this beautiful girl was interested in me, let alone loved me. We spent every second with each other and eventually I asked her parents the big question. I wanted to marry her after she was finished with high school. They expressed their concerns, but eventually said yes. She was 17 when I asked her to marry me and she said yes!\n\n      She was 18 and just finished high school when we got married. Most of her family hated the decision and very few people showed up to our marriage. It has now been five years of marriage and we have a beautiful two year old daughter. I don't really know why I wrote this post and I doubt many people will read it, but I am so in love with this woman. I still don't know what she saw in me at the beginning. I am just so thankful she took a chance on me. She has helped me in so many ways and now we are both active in the gym and still spend every second together.

It ended up causing a divide in our relationship, which we didn\u2019t speak for a couple of months as she was not used to this and it freaked her out. \n\nIn that time she meet a guy and ended up dating. Low and behold, he turned out be abusive and a womaniser. That relationship did not last long!\n\nWe have since connected again and do talk pretty often. I have caught up with her since and have taken her out just as friends. \n\nDuring this time of us rekindling our friendship,talking almost every other day and even catching up. I have actually fallen in love with this girl. However, I feel as though I could never tell her due to her not having the same feelings as me nor would I want to lose her again. \n\nI just wanted to put my feelings out there instead of keeping them bottled up.

Me and her were in the same group, along with our other current friends, we got along so well. I'm not gonna name anyone's name except me (Logan) and my girlfriend (Kayla), some of the people I know weren't there the first few days but came. but after this activity in our history class thing, He made us stand up, announce the trade we wanted (I go to a tech school) and who we are and 3 things we like, I found out we had stuff in common, same as the rest of us, but we were friends at the start, The summer program lasted for 2 weeks, Start on July 1st, which was a monday, July 4th we had off, and july 5th we were there, One of our new friends birthdays was that day, she wasn't there but, In gym, We played Badminton and i was showing off, screwing around, I Yelled NERF THIS, i went to hit the birdie, I missed it, and threw my racket across the gym, almost hitting kayla. That same day the meme in our friend group was ketchup packets, Kayla opened ketchup packet and it sprayed all over the table, and hit me and my phone. Ever since then, we were true friends. We all just memed around and screwed around til the last day came and we said our goodbyes, I got her number, i also met her sister, who threw a small water bottle at my ass. Ever since, we would text during the summer on and off and at the end of the academy, I grew feelings a bit but like, it was like one of those things you don't understand yet truly.\n\nFirst day of school came around (August 29th) and we all grouped up that day, and we went from there as friends, Made jokes, Texted through discord and google hangouts, introduced them to some of my old friends, throughout september, I had growing feelings for her, and it was the end of September, and I wrote in my notebook (Journal, whatever) that I had feelings but I didn't think she would like me and etc (major anxiety) and though one of my friends, Read my notebook, saw that and said, \"I know you like her\" and apparently, Kayla heard but like, didn't really, Understand, (Found that out later on) but yeah, my friend was like \"Either **You** give her the book and let her find out herself or ***I*** will tell her you do\" I was like, *uredbwfhj*, fine, here kayla (**Sweating intensely**) and then later on in the day, Math class, they were talking and hiding something, I heard laughing, giggling and etc, im like ***Whats going on*** and so next period, in Science, I asked her, SoOOO you know- or- she said YeaH. I'm like embarrassed to hell but then asked her out that same day. She said Yes.\n\nBro I was so happy, I've been through a lot of home issues, anywhere from Abusive to divorces and suicides. Being with her and getting with her was first step to happiness. We already talked every day as it was, but we got more in depth with stuff, She knows everything about me at this point and vice versa. We completely trust each other. Her parents found out, and her mom was (idrk tbh) but her dad found it hilarious, her uncle thought she was lesbian, her sister knew me and liked me, and her brothers met me afterward and we all play roblox together lmao. From october to november, On one month I was extremely happy and proud and we kept going daily, things were bad at my house but we made it through, Nothing major really happened except we would all joke around and by december, the Homecoming dance for 2019 was completely different. Big thing went down with One of my friends friends and her boyfriend doing it in the bathroom, she ran off and got lost, big thing, everything was alright in the end. We hugged non stop though. For christmas, I didn't really have a lot of money but her earbuds at the time were purple, one was broken, and the other one broke out and she didn't have any. She had them for about a year or two, Sooo I got her a new pair, In return, she gives me little artistic creations, and one was a heart of paper, with hearts and googly eyes and little inside jokes/comments and I cherish those thing. Christmas break came around, Everyone in my house had the flu, i was stuck at my aunts, I didn't say merry christmas til afterward on December 26th. I didn't get anything from my parents. Sadly, but not shocked.\n\n2020 Started, went back to school, by then everyone knew we were dating, it was amazing, this was 3 months in, and we would hug every day after school, being away from her was painful, We sat next to each other in science, and the desks made it so you can see under, cause 1 table held 4 chairs, and my friend Logan was to the right, Kayla was to the left, we'd work together helping each other out, and sometimes, ***we would squish each others thighs,*** but won't go to far into those details. February came around, for Valentines day, I found out she liked Sour skittles, a lot, So i bought her big bags of them, But I moderated her eating because I don't want her eating to much and making mouth bleed a bit from citric acid, so I did, 4 months into our relationship, My goal was to finally make a move and kiss her, by the end of february, I kissed her, for the first time, BUT I **MISSED HER LIPS**, Embarrassing as hell, so I was like *Tomorrow I will NOT miss,* next day, I missed again, but more hitting her lips (Don't judge, I've never kissed someone before) and then FINALLY, The next time I kissed her, I Hit her lips and we kissed, Our first kiss, both of us, and for our relationship. From then on, we kissed and hugged every day, a cute thing she would do is stand on my boots when we were in shop, cause she's 5 foot 1 and im 5 foot 7. March came around, That's when Corona was spreading, the friday it blew up, was my last day of physical in school for the rest of that school year. That day, me and her made out before we parted. We were told 2 weeks. 2 weeks turned to 3 months, 3 months turned into 8 months. and I'm on and off with a hybrid schedule, I don't see her during my academics, but on my monday and tuesday, she is in and im online, wednesday we all are online, and thursday and friday, I go in, and during shop its random days depending on our groups, on days one of us go in and other stay out, we text through day, When we both go in, we stay together, She is in carpentry, I'm in electrical, we have lunch together, and when we both are online, we call on discord for the day and talk and play roblox and do work.\n\nDuring the summer, we met up once, she gave me hand made carpet, green, but it was a rug, I cherished that thing, I gave her sour skittles, and my hoodie. We hugged and kissed and we parted. During summer we desperately missed each other. Girls would hit on me left and right, one of my old friends turned on me, He liked her apparently and got VERY sexual with her. But when school came around, I wanted to see her, so now we see each other like, at least twice a week in shop, and we text every day and night, and call when we can\n\nAs of right now, I see her tomorrow, the other day, we had our second make out session (not long) but It was in a blindspot in a hallway and we made out for a moment. Me and her are going strong, I bought her Dream (Fav Youtuber) Merch, Skullcandy earbuds, two pairs, and dream Youtooz, I got george, and for one year, Sour skittles and a necklace with yin and yang with our pet names on it.\n\n1 year and soon gonna be 1 year, 1 month, Going strong as hell, we love each other and if you guys read this, thank you &lt;3, I will update this throughout the years and months\n\nhave a good day you guys :D", "title": "My current relationship :D"}, {"created_utc": 1604087095, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/jl3qsp/if_this_make_50_like_i_will_say_my_crush_i_love/", "num_comments": 40, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "if this make 50 like i will say my crush i love her"}, {"created_utc": 1604085296, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/jl36sv/our_love_is_strong/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "When we get fall out we don't fall out because we hate each other.

We dated for six months, a rough six months i might add. I was clingy and she was distant. She broke up with me for (her words not mine) no reason. So i kinda fell apart wondering why i wasnt good enough and all that jazz. Six months of no contact later we meet up she apologises for what she did i apologized for handling it badly we start texting again. Three days into this she wants to get back together. At the time i was kinda having another thing but once again i came back to her . This time it was better i felt genuinely happy. It wasn't the healthiest relationship but i really thought we could work things out. 6 months into this phase she breaks up with me because of her abusive dad. He found out about us and forced her to stop talking to me. I suggested we stay together in secret i mean there's a million ways we could go about this but she didnt want to. Turns out we were gonna study at the same college and so i wanted things to not be so awkward between us and we became just friends. I couldnt handle that tho so i told her hey i still love you and she said i still love you too but im too busy for a relationship. A few weeks ago i suggested an open relationship to her which she agreed to for a week and then was like we need to figure out what we are. I told her i already know what i want you need to figure out what you want and last night she did. She said she couldn't keep me hanging like this. So i am now filled with conflicted emotions.

It entailed a hyperactivity along with delayed learning of what I'd narrow down to instincts. I did learn to question at a young age. When I was around the age of 5 I recall asking myself constantly, \"what allows me to have this experience?\". The further through the school years I went, the more isolated I'd become. Little socialization, and a bucket full of stigma and self-hatred. This made me great with the ladies, jokingly not. But that was all part of my coming to this moment, of which I plan to describe to the best of my ability.\n\nSince the start of 2020, my life started finding a track to learning what I needed to know. What I could see as useful in the future. The experiences I've had were like drug hits in my brain, giving me the feeling of being alive. In depressive states of mind, I'd just utter the words, \"keep breathing\". Because I knew this life was a rollercoaster of emotion. One day you're high, while you seemingly sink lower on the flip side. Going through the suicidal ideation stage, those words helped drag me to the next day no matter how dreadful.\n\nMost of the negative came from my mind wishing I could have something I couldn't which was the truth. At the time I couldn't grasp the mathematics required to graduate. I had a lot of questions about my life, so I took up writing and reading philosophy. I did really well in english and creative writing enticed me. Something I felt would come in handy at some point, I digress. I've learned considerable amounts about the physical world and now for whatever reason socialization is just a game to me. But I don't play it without integrity. I do care for my fellow man as I know what's dragging him down.\n\nThe work and dating life was something I found many faults in. I'd gotten to that work, sleep, work stage and couldn't find true north. Dating felt like a game of aesthetics and stability hidden behind a veil of lust and deception. Sex is now no different than alcoholism in so far as it's addictive and destructful. I've been down that road before. Sure sex is fun, fun in being comfortable with another person when you're the most vulnerable. Without a connection or something resembling the idea of love, I felt sex was a tiring act for something I could do better by myself. The urge being strictly instinctual, as well as attraction. But attraction has been guised just like mainstream music in recent times. Actual beauty ignored, and we only see the material that covers it. We scratch the surface of something infinite.\n\nMid July 2020, I had crashed my motorcycle. I had gotten a concussion that healed surprisingly fast. But the hole it lead me down was the key to my problems. I realized everything I had and wanted were just tools to ignore my suffering. But most of those tools were in learning, and visualizing. Just like drinking to excess, narcotics, promiscuity, self improvement and destruction. I bought the motorcycle and really enjoyed the escape from thought. A tool of ignorance, which there's no harm in doing. But most people go to reckless lengths to dissolve the past. I've experienced the darkest hells, and the brightest of lights that make you feel alive on the inside. But this is all my perspective which is subjective to my experience alone. In the beginning of August, I was to go on a vacation with my family. I decided to start being honest with them about why I felt the way that I did. I didn't want to go to somewhere I'm supposed to enjoy when I feel like my world was crumbling beneath me. This is where Amor Fati comes into play.\n\nI had brought with the books I had written in since 2016 with the intention to re-read it, and write about my recent past. I did exactly that as I was tossing and turning with thoughts that I had to get down on paper. At the bottom of the page, \"You have to kill who you think yourself to be, to really know who you are in this world.\" Think of it as a psychological ego death. Of which I had studied psychology a bit and understood the personality in a Jungian sense. Not until I awoke the very next day in a mental and physiological sense that rocked me to the core for the next seven days. Raised by my mother, I was very introverted but still interested in things. I'd say being high in agreeableness led me on the path that I am now. But after that night, the psychology made sense. As that was my shadow that slipped into me.\n\nThe best I can to to narrow down what had happened was, my evils were known, my goods were highlighted and strengthened. Fears, beliefs, and values were all re-evaluated. Fear being the greatest of them. To do away with unneeded stress when I'm alive and living in this moment. I knew what I wanted and I knew there was no harm word's can inflict except in this modern time where words have transformed into weapons. Emotional attachment to things other than yourself. I learned everything I didn't know in very little time socially speaking, and there's an off chance I'm practicing pool alone. The beauty is of not caring about anything but yourself, while being mindful of how you carry yourself is incredible. Unless you're just looking for attention or being a prick. I only do when I have something to say.\n\nTaking in everything I knew\n\nOf course I wanted a woman to care for. No not just sex, but I kept attraction important. I had revaluated the roles humans play and it was all clear. When lust kills me but love changes my life. How someone reacts is incredibly telling about their character. I decided to meet a few friends who like to drink a lot on the weekends, so I offer to be their ride. Took me two hours to coaxed them into going. I had enough of the altercations that go on in such environments. Men/Woman when drunk, show their true self. Angry just means not at ease with oneself. Just my assumptions. We arrive and a few people I know are there, I start dancing and enjoying myself while only having one beer. After about an hour, I was dancing and had the urge to look at the bar as if something told me to do so.\n\nI saw a girl I'd never seen before, but she was incredibly attractive to me. A younger woman that had the same aesthetics as me, hair, eye's and complexion. Like a ray from above lit her hair aflame in blue tint. That's our instincts working in our favor, and I was mindful of it. Looking into my past was the truth teller. I instantly walked up and introduced myself. As happy as given the first breath of air, I looked into her blue eyes and pupils the size of the universe. I had asked her if anyone has ever said she looked like Margot Robbie, she replies, \"My friends have, now I got to see.\" Pulls her phone out and denies it, I'm like, sure hon. A buddy wanted to play a game of pool so I obliged. Shaking her hand sent a shock through my spine as well as a shock from the eyes. Not craving attention was a key to gaining her trust because I'd never wish harm upon her. I happily went off to play pool. I wanted to see what would follow.\n\nIn the midst of playing, I was shaken to the core about her. Something was there and I knew it. I look my friend in the eye, \"who the hell is that?\". \"who?\", he whispers. I see a blur walking right in front of my face to the right, but I was too focused on telling him how serious I was. Then I suspected it could be her. I glanced behind me, tilted my head back while rolling my eyes back; As it was her. Very soft spoken, she asks if I'd want to play pool. I happily agreed. In the mean time I kept my mind in the game as much as possible. Sadly I played better when she was 30 feet away, not 5. We ended up playing two rounds with a few of our mutual friends surrounding. But there was a specific moment I looked at my friend midst game, held my finger to the artery in my neck. I utter, \"I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack!\" Of course I said it with the biggest smile I've known my face to produce. I looked behind me to see her lining up her cue, as she was staring right back into my eyes. Everything before and after the night at camp lead me on a path of doing specific things in order to see reality as it is. As well as meeting her no matter the outcome or consequences. They were worth it.\n\nWe had finished our two rounds, then she played another with my friend as there was just enough time till pub close for another. I had to go outside to breath in fresh air to control myself. I went back to the pool table and she asked if I could give her a ride home because she was tipsy, I agreed but I knew I had 5 other friends I had to bring home in the opposite direction, as if I hate driving. More therapeutic than acupuncture provided you're around nature and not the concrete jungle. I only wished the drive was longer. We sat and talked about relationships to an extent. I just said that I don't agree with the modern idea of relationships. She asked, \"why?\" in confusion. \"Because lack of communication is probably the the greatest killer of good partnerships.\"   She thought that made sense. The second we keep our mouth shut in a case where something should be known, it buries a demon that always festers at a later date, if not followed by several others. Being like 4am, we hug and say our goodbyes after exchanging contact info. I conclude the night with music, coffee, and endless writing.\n\nTo be continued:\n\nIt's not until we're at the bottom, come to terms with it, accept it, that we finally see a path to the top. The bottom shows who we are at the core. We see our goods and evils. and their accepted and you learn your worth. After this I've discovered the sexiest most beautiful organ in human anatomy, the eyes. Even your own. Once you can look in the mirror, smile in true happiness, and see your own pupils dilate, you know it's the real you.\n\nYou live becoming cynical of love's existence as time passes. Through repeated pain, you feel like it's a lie or an illusion. So did I. Once you learn to accept who and what you are, you'll see both sides of the equation. You'll be able to define the difference between what really matters and what's benign. The things that make you stronger versus the things that destroy your soul as you feel it. Once you can see yourself and see beauty, you'll see the beauty in others. Accepting their past, and present as we all have unique circumstances. As rare as a similar fingerprint.

And I find it weird  that even his family haven't  once fir 2 yrs  asked him or me when we will get married or what at least  we plan for the future. \n\nSo, I have caught  that he has messaged and called a female friend of his. They will even meet up next week. They talk quite often. He has once even got to her apartment  when we had a fight. I have always  had something on my mind for her but since she moved to another city because of Covid i thought  its ok. But now I see that she is coming  back. He has denied  if he has cheated  and I trust him but still I'm worried that he likes her after all. \n\nRecently  he injured  his toe. After getting  out of the ER (its not that serious ) he blamed me for what happened. He said that it's my fault  because I haven't  closed the cabinet completely. Which was super weird  for me. I apologized even tho the wardrobe  is broken and I don't  believe that it's  my fault. \n\nHe also stopped  helping  me doing the housework. \n\nHe stopped  pampering me log ago (like to open the door for me or to give me a message  seldom). \n\nI made an experiment  recently. I got my mom's dog for 2 months. He hasn't  even got the water or food changed or filled  for the dog without  me telling him. I instantly  thought : what if we had a baby?! \n\nAnd last but not least  our love life is awful. Once a month is plenty  for him. We even had a half of an year period without  anything.

All of those awful cliches I didn\u2019t believe in are true, I just didn\u2019t experience them until falling in love with him. I settled in all of my past relationships, including my marriage. I got married at an age some would consider fairly young (25) and it did not take long for that relationship to completely crumble. I sat around complacent instead of learning how to be an adult. I was not a kind wife. I knew I wasn\u2019t in love with my husband. We hit a rough patch (shocking!) where I left, came back, and we tried therapy. Nothing stuck and every problem came back months later. I was a big portion of the problem and I take full responsibility for it. Towards the end, I actively spent as little time as I could with my ex husband. I was miserable, didn\u2019t communicate what was wrong, and instead would just go out (not like whoring around but drinking a lot and smoking/taking pills with shitty people and lying my ass off about it). Sometimes I would drive to this lake and sit there alone just waiting for it to be past the time my ex husband went to sleep. I don\u2019t know if anyone really knew my drinking problem was back, but if was obvious I had thrown in the towel. Eventually my ex husband asked \u2018do you want to be here?\u2019 And I said no. It was absolutely terrifying, but it speaks volumes that the only thing I miss from that relationship are my dogs and bathtub.\n\nI met Pat online really randomly while still with my husband. We did not physically have a relationship but I knew I loved him the first time we talked, and it wasn\u2019t even flirty at all at first. I am not proud of it or justifying it. My heart was completely his and I dreamt of a life with him. He was the person I should have said \u201cI do\u201d to.\n\nMy life is pretty much a fucking dream now. I\u2019m sober again. I wake up everyday next to the man I love in our house we pay for together. We have two goofy rescue dogs that we care for together. We dance around and laugh and cook and clean together and it is exactly what a partnership should be. Our house is the perfect mix of our two personalities. Pat doesn\u2019t coddle me, as he shouldn\u2019t, and I have grown so much. My credit score has gone up nearly 100 points. I bought my dream car. I have a savings account. But material possession aside, our relationship is filled with so much mutual love and respect. We communicate extremely well, even if it takes a little bit of cooling down after a fight to do so.  We go out of our way to do things for each other, even if they\u2019re little or stupid. I never have any doubts about us. There is full trust. I used to not trust shit.\n\nFamily is important to me and I was pretty terrified to say hey Mom and Dad I told ex I didn\u2019t want to be with him when he asked and now I\u2019m moving out and am going to be seeing a man you don\u2019t know! I moved in with Pat like a month after leaving. Surprisingly, my parents were so fucking supportive. They saw happiness and good changes, and they love Pat. My Dad especially, which shocked me. He texts Pat stupid memes every day and even though they bump heads politically, they love and respect each other. My sister always hated my ex so she had low expectations for my boyfriend but her and her husband literally both said thank fuck, we love him. They call him Uncle Pat to my niece.\n\nHis parents love me as much as I love them. They already refer to me as their daughter and said they are amazed at the changes they see in him and how happy he is. I love his entire family like my own.\n\nMy best friend and I had a falling out a little over a year ago and we have \u2018gotten back together\u2019 (because we refer to our absences in each other\u2019s lives as a break up). Her and Pat get along so well and her boyfriend and Pat love each other. We\u2019ll FaceTime and Pat will take my phone to talk to her and fight about music and it makes my heart burst. She has said multiple times she is so happy to have her friend back because I\u2019m finally \u2018me\u2019 again.\n\nShe also told me some things that stung. She had a conversation or two with my ex husband while her and I weren\u2019t speaking and naturally it was unkind. She was wholly honest and sent me everything. It was not easy to read but I forgave her wholeheartedly and haven\u2019t dwelled on it since. I know people say things they don\u2019t mean when they\u2019re upset, and when I finally pulled my head out of my ass and realized what I had done, we were healed. I mention this because \u2018old me\u2019 would\u2019ve obsessed over this for..probably the rest of my life. Our relationship is the strongest it\u2019s ever been and it is because I have become whole. I found myself and took myself back.\n\nPat is my fucking galaxy. If someone tries flirting with me it\u2019s a joke. \u2018Old me\u2019 loved attention. I used to post tons of cringe thirst trap selfies and deluded myself into thinking it was because I was proud of how healthy I got (I was actually super anorexic and lost a fuck ton of weight and loved being noticed). It\u2019s embarrassing, but everything led me to where I am so I do not dwell, I just learn.\n\nTrue love has the power to change and move you, even if that move means a kick in the ass to get your head on straight and grow the fuck up and be better.

We instantly hit it off and slept together (no sex) the next two nights but unfortunately I had to leave town the third day as I was on vacation. I missed her a lot.\n\nEventually, in October, she came to visit my college where her hometown friend also goes. Obviously, she came to visit me too. We hung out a lot and had a really good time, sleeping together more. Eventually though she had to leave again and I was nearly heartbroken. I was falling for this girl already.\n\nUntil Christmas break, she came to my town THREE MORE TIMES, hanging out with me more and more every time. By the third trip, we told eachother we loved eachother. As Christmas break rolled around, we were talking all day, every day. From waking up with a snapchat to going to bed with a FaceTime. I missed her so much.\n\nThen came New Years, and I went down to San Diego to visit her and our mutual friend for a birthday. The first night in town, I caught her making out with another dude. Broke my heart. So the next night, I had the great idea of getting blacked out on whiskey and absolutely going off on her. Told her I hated her, never wanted to see her again, etc. I did worse things too I will not mention. I didn\u2019t remember any of it until she told me days later.  I apologized profusely, and we\u2019ve barely spoke since.\n\nNow, she has MOVED to my town and will be going to the same school as me. Great. I haven\u2019t seen her yet (been here for a week) but she has been around my large friendgroup\u2019s parties and such. Just haven\u2019t run into her yet.  I thought I could get over her, but I can\u2019t.\n\nThe walls of my room are painted with her memories. My bed feels empty without her. The smell of her hair and the sight of her eyes haunt me. I had sex with a stranger a few nights ago but it only made me miss her more. I\u2019m still in love with her and I don\u2019t know what to do. The fact that she literally lives two blocks away from me now makes it even worse.\n\nI have so much love to give and I want to give it all to her. The New Years incident was a terrible disaster and I\u2019ve done everything to make sure it never happens again; such as quitting hard liquor. I want to have things back as the way they were, before it all. Am I na\u00efve for this?\n\nPart of me wants to just text her or call her to meet in person so I can pour my heart out to her.

He also liked me for a few months, but nothing ever happened because we were hiding our feelings for each other. After a few months he got back together with his first ever ex (they both were their firsts, they experienced new things together) . He broke up with her a month later and then started showing me way more interested, he was more straight forward this time. I still acted like I was his friend. He got back together again with her 2 months later and they've been together ever since. They actually celebrated their anniversary just recently.\n\nNow, he's my close friend/classmate and we see each other all day everyday because of school. I feel like he still likes me though, even though he has a girlfriend, because he does these things:\n- he stares at me in class\n- he sits beside me when he can\n- he teases me ALL THE TIME\n- he sometimes touches me (like for example he touches me with his knees or he tickles me)\n- he often asks if I want to eat lunch with him\n- he wants to hang out alone with me at school\n- he just smiles in such a cute way when he's with me\ud83e\udd7a\n- he mirrors my action\n- even though he's on the other side of the class (to give you and idea: there are 3 rows of desks, he's in the far right side of the middle row, and I'm in the last row, on the far left side) his body is turned towards me\n\nBUT, there are a few things that kinda make me doubt if he's interested in me... :\n- when I ask him to hang out outside of school he finds an excuse as not to hang out\n- he finds it hard to open up with me\n- usually I'm the first one to text him, even though lately he has sometimes texted me first\n\nPlus:\n- he doesn't post ANYTHING about his girlfriend, even though they've been together for more than a year now! (and yes, his girlfriend does post about them)\n- our classmates always watch us and smile/laugh as if they know something that we don't...one of them even asked my friend if there was ever something between me and him\n- he sometimes makes comment about other girls, like \"she has such a nice body, ass,...\" stuff like that, or sometimes he even compliments them! Me and my friends found that weird so we asked him about it and he said \"things between me and my gf are going so well, that I can allow myself to talk to other girls, or talk about them\"...dude wtf\n\nI mean, I think he likes / has always liked me, but can't do anything about it because he knows that he has a girlfriend. He also still may be unsure about if I like him. I'm trying not to do anything too risky, because I respect the fact that he's taken. But I just love him so much and it hurts when he acts like this.

I was so naive and inexperienced and overwhelmed that I \u2018didn\u2019t play it to well\u2019 and turned out to be less than she had hoped for or something of the kind I guess. This girl is insanely hot like 9 or 10, and in a room full of men, all eyes are on her type of woman. Also she is probably way out of my league, I\u2019m prob a 6-7. Anyway I learn she has a boyfriend for a few years like 3 and I visited their apartment community twice now, both times the boyfriend wasn\u2019t there, but a plethora of people were, one time we went swimming in her pool. I have never been in a grand relationship with a woman in my life, and well I end up falling for this girl so hard, every single thing about her just destroyed me. One day my emotional tangle became so overwhelming that I ended up telling her that I really liked her. ***Bad Move*** I knew she had a bf at this time. She says we can still be friends and that\u2019s that. A few months go by and I end up getting fired from the job where we both worked for really stupid reasons. After this for me this girl was always the symbol of the type of woman that I seek for a life partner. I hold this woman in such a high manner that I avoided her for years. I avoided her because I was so afraid of her seeing me accomplish nothing and not moving forward and disappointing her only further. I think of this girl so often, and a couple of times fantasized about somehow getting with her. I am a fan of all women, there are hot ones and fat ones, but none have ever crossed my path like this, none that I have met made feel the same electricity that the girl I speak about does. I dare not even think explicit things about her for I would never treat her in such a simple way. (You men know what I mean) A year and a half or so goes by and I finally see this woman again. We speak and chat only momentarily. I learn that I will see her once a week at my new job. \n\nMy emotional entanglement has re-knotted itself with thoughts of this woman. I know she is in a relationship and has a whole life and community on her side of the world. But for the love of god I can\u2019t stop falling in love by thinking about now that I have seen her again. I don\u2019t even know what real love this to be honest. I just know that my heart-aches, I am stressed about life more now, and even though I try not, I am filled with jealousy when I think about her with someone else. For some reason I just care so much about this person and know I need to let her go. I have to let myself go from her. For a while she has been a symbol for me and the most beautiful woman I have ever known. I think talking to her about this stuff would probably just fail and she would think of me as a weirdo.  I wish I didn\u2019t not think this hard about this but what the heck. In another world I would gladly love a girl such as this for all eternity, and I don\u2019t even know her thaat well. \n\nI have the utmost respect for this girl, and can\u2019t h3lp but think I am falling again for her. I think I will just stay my ground and not do anything rash for the days that are forward. It\u2019s just my emotions are so heavy, and I am finding I am stressed more, complaining to myself \u201cman I wish I had a girlfriend\u201d etc.. Two days ago I thought for sure I saw her in the morning in her car drive by while I was stopped at a light. The car was identical to hers it seemed and I thought why is she in this part of town at this time? Devious thoughts went into my head and my chest was sore as ever, jealousy clawing at my heart. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy because I have never felt this attracted to a woman before and that fire has never quite gone out in me, but I also know realistically I need to let her go. I remember when I told her how I felt about her I felt so much better. Man I need to learn to just be friends with her. But can\u2019t I do that without getting strings attached? She is 3 years older than me, she said once \u201cwe\u2019re about the same age\u201d. I can\u2019t h3lp but feel regret for the days I first met her, to think if I had been an successful self made 22 year old with his shit together, that maybe thing would have turned out differently. It makes me wonder what her intention was when we began talking. Thoughts such as these have never quite gone by me without me giving a care. To me, she is a light like no other.\n\nThough I dare use the word love, I would say I have smelt the sweet air of first love from down the pathway. \n\n\n\n\nPlease tag other Reddit\u2019s I should probably have or will post this in.", "title": "Thinking about a girl, 25m"}, {"created_utc": 1610976605, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/kzuoce/i_took_my_boyfriend_to_dinner_on_friday/", "num_comments": 20, "score": 1, "selftext": "It was a spontaneous late night decision.

Two years ago, I (28F) was abandoned by my now ex husband (26M) of 1.5 years. No kids, we were both young when we tied the knot. He just heartlessly ran away to be with someone else. I was devastated and needed some escape. On the night of my ex\u2019s birthday, I decided fuck it, might as well get fucked.\n\nIt was an uneventful standard night at the club. The alcohol was starting to kick in but nothing could stop me from getting shit faced. On my way to the bar, this guy, out of nowhere just passionately kissed me. He has this angelic kind face, blonde messy surfer hair and green eyes. After we locked lips, he confidently asked \u201cWant to come with me?\u201d Hellz yeah, after 4 years of being faithful in a relationship which is now a broken marriage, I was ready to whore around. \n\nOn the way to his place I started to notice how much this guy looks waaay younger than me, like a decade younger than me at least. Let\u2019s call him B.  When we arrived at his \u201cplace\u201d, that\u2019s when i learned that B is a fisherman and we were about to do the deed on their fishing boat.  The place stank of fish and salt, so we decided to come back to mine\u2019s instead.\n\nWe had the most mindblowing, passionate, soft, rough, wonderful sex that night. After we climaxed, he offered me a cigarette. Never in my life have I ever felt so wired with a one night stand. We talked about our lives, dreams and families. I opened up to him about my recently betrayed marriage. And yep, he was 18 years old this time (now 20). He showed me his driver\u2019s licence coz i kind of freaked out despite having the hunch.\n\nHe came back to my place the next day, the day after that and also the next. We spent 5 consecutive nights exploring each other\u2019s bodies, watching movies, talking, and cuddling to sleep. We went clubbing together and danced all night long the following weekend. I felt young and full of sex. People gave us looks upon noticing our age gap. Sadly for them, we didn\u2019t give a flying fuck. We made out and danced in front of every body.  Younger ladies danced with him and I also danced with other men in front of him. The thrill of seeing each other get hit on by other people and knowing that we have each other at the end of the night was just fucking sexy. \n\nAfter weeks of partying, I fell sick with flu and lost my voice. This is way before covid-19 (2019) and clubbing wasn\u2019t prohibited. I could barely get up from my bed and he was there to take care of me. He bought my groceries/medicine, cleaned my apartment and provided me a steady amount of sex. It was hot and yet so pure. \n\nI never knew cunnilingus until this person gifted it to me. We spent nights on the boat, slept naked under the sheets, skinny dipped on some occasions we\u2019re high of weed. He always brought me fish and cooked it for me. He was my best friend. Idk it\u2019s possible despite the age gap.\n\nThis went on for a couple of months. He went back to sea, came back after a couple of weeks. We continued to meet up in between his sailing trips. I was never lonely or sad whenever he leaves, I kept it cool and didn\u2019t expect us to keep in contact when he\u2019s out in the sea. He had a way of reading me, Idk. It was weird? He would always hug me and cuddle me before be leaves. We always kissed goodbye without knowing when we\u2019ll see each other next. The routine went on. \n\nHe would text me maybe 3-4 times a week during his sailing trips, just update me on the amount of fish they caught and whatnot. \n\nOne day he had to fly back to his state, we didnt see each other for a couple of months until Halloween night. We randomly saw each other at the club and ended up going home together. This was a very memorable night. He told me \u201cIdk, i am gravitated towards you and idk how to explain it. I trust you more than anybody in my life.\u201d  We had sex and cuddled each other to sleep. The next day, he had to leave again. \n\nThis routine on again for a couple of months. We loved sleeping together and would get sad upon saying goodbye. We still hooked up with other people. We shared stories about it. None of us were jealous. We both looked forward to telling each other the fun we had when the other was away. \n\nHe had to go home because of covid-19. On the last night we spent together, we both cried and said we loved each other. We both felt like it had to be said but At the same time we were also at peace knowing the fact that we cannot be together.  It was sad but beautiful. There was no sense of ownership or neediness to end up together. I dont know how to explain it. It was probably the most intense connection i have ever had. More intense than my marriage. \n\nOne day B messaged me saying \u201cI dreamt of you today. I know in another life there is you and me. My soul is always with you. I see people and things that always reminds me of you.\u201d \n\nI still talk to B from time to time as a friend. I am now with someone else my age. My current boyfriend has a nephew. He\u2019s very close to me and we have this unique bond. He loves fishing and wants to own a boat someday when he grows up. He brings me fish when he is lucky to catch one. I love him like my nephew and no not in a way that I felt about B. (Lol i had to say it)\n\nMy bf\u2019s nephew told me that he wants to celebrate his birthday with me because I am his \u201csoulmate\u201d. Surprisingly, Nephew happens to share the same birthday as B.\n\nIdk why but in some ways the nephew reminds me of B. Soulmates doesn\u2019t have to be romantic or have to be bf/gf. I think it\u2019s mainly two souls  drawn to be kind to each other and will always guide each other in some way, shape of form even if they are not physically around each other. \n\nI am very grateful for the friendship I had with my soulmate and I am at peace knowing that there\u2019s no need to be together in the end.

The books were in fact a gift but while I wrapped them, we proceeded to talk about books. We both love the Never-ending story and Narnia and His Dark Materials. These are my favorite books and there was never anyone my age that I was able to talk to (in REAL LIFE) about how genius or maybe sometimes biased the authors are. \n\nThis guy has me speechless. But dumb little me, nervous and shy as I am, forgets to ask for his name. And so I go day by day hoping this beautiful human being comes back to my bookstore so we can maybe finally exchange names on time for christmas. Turning into our own Netflix Christmas Movie.

I can\u2019t do it anymore.\n\nShe came out of nowhere like a damn fiery goddess. I was so blown away, I had no idea that we\u2019d get to this point. She\u2019s so amazing, so beautiful, so intelligent, it\u2019s just insane to me that she\u2019d feel the same way about me. \n\nI feel like when people say to marry your best friend, they usually mean to go after the best friend you\u2019ve been friends with for years. I didn\u2019t even know her until we randomly started talking on Instagram and somehow my dickheaded ass didn\u2019t even notice the beautiful bombshell on campus. When she told me she had had a crush on me I was like wtf. \n\nHer eyes are so big and beautiful. I could look into them forever because they\u2019re so warm and I just feel her. I work so hard to make her laugh because that sound has become one of my most favorite sounds in the world, and her smile when she does is dazzling. She has such a great sense of humor, I just enjoy being in her presence because it\u2019s fun and it feels RIGHT. I think my biggest surprise is how much I love how chatty she is, she can literally talk and talk and talk and I fucking love it because I\u2019m not much of a talker, I\u2019m happy just listening to her and understanding her and what she likes and dislikes and how she feels. I can listen to her for hours. \n\nShe\u2019s so emotional and clingy but somehow still fiery and tough, and I love it all. My little crybaby thug, able to make me feel so safe and comfortable and at the same time turn me on to never ending heights with her spiciness. I love her passion and heat and how she isn\u2019t afraid to speak her mind and let her thoughts be be known. She\u2019s so real and down to earth.\n\nBut I think my favorite thing is how she lights up when I come over. She told me that she wants to be with me all the time, just in each other\u2019s company, but is always afraid to be too much because of how much of a introvert I am, but still hasn\u2019t fully grasped that I want to be with her all the time, too. We can be doing everything or doing nothing and I\u2019d be happy. Watching her little drama shows and cooking and lounging around in pajamas is just as amazing as going out on a date where she gets so dressed up and looks so fucking stunning. \n\nI honestly had no idea I\u2019d feel this much for her, but I\u2019m glad I do.

He explained to that she has a mental list of people she wouldnt say no to if they asked her out and apparently i was high up on that list.

It came to a point where in the parents cursed my SO that if she would not get back with the guy that she will not have a good life kind of things.\n\nMy SO loves her parents so much, she's being pressured everyday to get back with her ex to the point her ex is always invited on family gatherings and what not without my SO knowing then the guy will just suddenly come. \n\nI love the girl so much, We clicked the instance we talked, we met one time and with that moment it didn't feel like it was our first time meeting, the comfortability was there, there were no barriers. We almost always agree on most things but the only thing I am worried is she is always pressured. \n\nWe live in a country where parents are considered always right. And she admits that anytime she will always choose her parents. I can see that she really wants me. We tried not talking for a little bit because her parents pressured again and found out she was talking to someone else and almost hurt her while talking to her, but after a while we can't just live without each other and started talking again. \n\nBut she can't choose me between her parents because as she told me she is scared that a time will come due to the state of the world where in her parents has some sickness that they will die with them having a bad relationship because she chose me kind of thing.\n\nI want to fight for her. Right now her parents doesn't know that we are still talking, And slowly they are talking to her again but still forcing her to get back with the Guy. She also mentioned that she straight up said to the ex that she doesn't like him anymore and should stay our of her life, but the ex still keeps coming back and going to her house when invited by the parents. She doesn't have the courage to fight and I want to stay with her. \n\nShe is a good soul, She doesn't want to hurt her ex and her parents. I can understand where she is coming from judging by how families in my country are controlling.\n\nShe is 26 and I am 22 and we both have an stable job. I also opened up the option that we should just escape and live together but still she doesn't have the courage. I can see how depressed she gets whenever the ex goes to their house or her parents insists that she gets back with him.

I'm 23, she is 22. Our plan was that I am going travel to Malaysia to finish my university, and she was going to Vietnam to work. Both a dream of mine and hers. Go on a long distance relationship until I finish university, and then meet again somewhere in Asia. This was always our plan. \nAbout a week ago she had to travel for 2 weeks, comeback and then travel to Indonesia in January. And today she told me that she doesn't know when she is might go straight to Indonesia, meaning I don't know when I will see her again. We knew that was eventually going to happen. We agreed that we would continue dating as a long distance relationship for a few years, until we both sort out our lives and go back to the same country. But I never thought it was going to happen this soon. I wasn't ready for this. I miss her so much already and I can't imagine that I won't see her anytime soon. I don't know how to react, I'm still in denial hoping that she comes back for a few weeks before she travels again because that was the original plan. I want to be supportive as much as I can, she is pursuing her dream after all. But on the other side, I love her and I need her. I guess my question is, how do I support her and in the same time show her that she matters to me. Every time we talk about it, I try to be as objective as I can, because after all, I just want her to be happy. Out of all people she deserves to be happy, she deserves to go love her dream. But in the same time I fear that she might think that I don't care if she comes back. How do I strike the right balance?

I know this might sound both cheesy and cynical as hell, but hear me out. \n\nI\u2019ve asked people in my life why they love their particular partners and no one has given me an answer satisfying enough that it would not be interchangable with other people. \n\nSociologically speaking, if you name all the traits you love about your partner, it\u2019s not unreasonable to find something similar or even better in other people. My sister has said she loves her boyfriend because, compared to all the partners she\u2019s had, he genuinely cares about her. My parents stick with each other for practical reasons, like needing a place to stay, financial stability, etc. My frat brother has told me love just is. While this is the only answer I\u2019ve found to be close to satisfying, it doesn\u2019t justify why people choose to stick it out with their partners through the thick and thin.\n\nPersonally, my answer is that I have attachment issues and my girlfriend has made me feel safe to be vulnerable. But then again, is the contrast with other girls because of a positive about her or is it just due to a problem with myself? Both? But if either of the two is true, I could always be able to find a safe place elsewhere. \n\nGenerally, we can say that it\u2019s our experiences with our partner that\u2019s really unique. But who\u2019s to say you can\u2019t build other experiences? \n\nUltimately, however - and this is both what scares and amuses me - I believe love is just a product of statistical probability. It\u2019s just a leap of faith we take and that uncertainty is what makes it exciting. It\u2019s like a game of Deal or No Deal, except you already know what your initial case is worth, you choose to play the fool and stick with the other person no matter what (for the most part), and you know they\u2019re doing it for you too. That mutual choice is what makes the experience worthwhile.\n\nFor clarity's sake, I don't want to leave my girlfriend. Sometimes, though, it can just be hard. While I can hold on to this idea, I keep thinking there might be something else more motivating. \n\nSo humor me, why do people love? Why do YOU love?\n\nPS\n\nIf you have resources to look into, please share them as well, preferably with a reason why you recommend them.

You just moved away from them because of their Overthinking problem.\nEven sometimes you too feel that people are leaving you behind just because you think a lot. People started taking you not so serious and couldn\u2019t consider your points even when you\u2019re not overthinking. It is really hard for an overthinker to date anyone. It\u2019s because they have lakhs of thoughts dancing into their mind.\nBut if you love that person, Here are few tips on how to date an Overthinker.\n1. Be OK with making lots of decisions.\nOverthinkers usually suffer from indecisiveness. They cannot easily take decisions, instead, they think a lot, imagining every perspective. And the results are almost null.\n2. Never LIE to an Overthinker.\nIf you lie to them they will constantly think about that until they found a suitable reason. Mostly time they are trying to figure out where did they were wrong that made you lie to them.\n3. Be compassionate when you receive thousands of Insecurities.\nTheir problems and their thoughts in multi Direction cause them to feel insecure. So be humble and kind to them and work on eradicating those thoughts instead of fighting.\n4. Reassure them that you are not going anywhere.\nWhenever they feel insecure or low. Reassure them that you\u2019re not going to leave them. You\u2019ve decided to face the world and spend a beautiful life with them.\n5. Understand that they can\u2019t control their thoughts.\nIt\u2019s not their fault. Honestly. Understand that they are this only.\n6. Be clear about what you intend to say to avoid misunderstanding.\nBe clear in your words and thoughts behind that. Because Overthinker will tear your every word and ask you continuously till they won\u2019t get a satisfactory answer.\nAnd finally\n7. Trust them when they say I love You.\nThey already had gone through thousands of reasons to not love you. But once they decided to love you, you can\u2019t change their mind.

At first it was just natural hi &amp; hello. And then came the month of October. When half of October passed. We really started giving a load of time to us. We would text for 10-11 hours everyday. We would wake up to do rest of the studying work afterwards. \nThis trend of talking 10-11 hours Everyday stretched to Middle of January 2021. After that, we got our institutions opens. But we would still talk for 4-5 hours. \nAnyway, between this point. Something happened which shouldn't have happened. Or maybe it should have. To be honest, I don't know at this point anymore. I started loving her. Really really loving her. There are many reasons. It's mainly the little things and she is just, just amazing. I have written letters to her, 6 long letters till now and that girl remembers each of them by heart. We are not together right now.

I support her too. She makes me laugh.\n\nAnyway, We do talk a lot about philosophy of Love &amp; Relationship. \nShe is the curious one. She would ask me questions.

There are lots of girls out there like me\" \n3)\"I am not the last girl left, then why me\"\n4)\"Should we be chasing one person, if there are loads of people out there like them\"\n5)\"Preferences and taste change with time, maybe you will like someone else in the future\"\n6)\"How can a person be sure someone better won't come in their world in future\"\n\n\n\nHow I tell her that she may not be perfect, but she is perfect for me. How do I tell her that I solely love her. And it's not just about finding a girl. How Do I explain her that yes there are many person who can be our potential partners. But If I love her, I love her. I choose her. And even if someone else comes in future. She is the one I want, people in future won't even matter. Why would I try my chances with someone else and not focus on her solely. Yes There may be many like her. But I love her individually. How do I tell her that she is the one I want. Or Love is perserving, it can last. Or people wouldn't come together at all.

He makes me feel so good about myself as I suffer from low self-esteem and a lack of confidence. He makes me feel so beautiful and loved. The happiness he gives me is out of this world. Above all this goodness, he is beautiful. He has the most beautiful eyes ever; I could look at them for the rest of my life and I wouldn't ask for anything else.

AFAIK, she just goes around looking for people who need assistance and doing things with them, which is basically what I did the first few weeks I worked there.\n\nOne day she came in and asked if I needed any assistance while I didn't have a class visiting, and I just let her hang out and talk story for like half an hour.

And to top it all off, she's really pretty, and she has the cutest smile when I'm around her.\n\nThere's also been a couple days where I've come in and found a bowl of chocolate chip cookies with a card from her with hearts on it on my desk.

I told her today had been great and I couldn't think of anywhere else I would rather be right now. She said she also had a great time, and that she really liked being around me. We looked at each other for a bit until she decided to pull me in and kiss me! It was my first kiss with anyone in my life, and let me tell you, I fucking loved it. We spent the next 20 minutes laying there on the beach kissing and making out passionately.\n\nAfter we were done making out, I decided it was time to go. I would've loved to stay for a few more hours, but was getting dark, and the area gets really dangerous at night with all the drug dealers and addicts running around. We drove around for a little bit before I dropped her off at home, and we shared another good night kiss before I left.\n\nWell, I can tell this girl is a keeper.

I\u2019ll try to break it down.\nAll happens over about the last 6 months.\n\n-Move to new town for a job, creative work, small team.\n-In some weird long distance open thing with someone from back home.\n-New meet coworker via Google meet first day. She is beautiful and seems very professional, got a low key crush, tell my open partner about it.\n-Hang out and get drinks after the first week or so, we both live nearby. \n-Hit it off, we do the same drugs (just pot mainly), drink. We get drunk and stoned.\n-She has a boyfriend, shares story of going out and having some dude creep on her.\n-Talk about my weird open long distance thing\n-Good vibe, nice to actually just be friends and not worry about my little crush. \n-I go on tinder dates, meet someone I see for a couple months or so, ends up just evolving into a friendship\n-Open relationship dissolves very strangely. Kinda pretty heart broken. \n-Just keep becoming better friends with coworker. It\u2019s a pandemic, only know like two people in town. We\u2019re kinda best friends.\n-Talk about life and relationships a lot. I\u2019m bi, so have a lot of different thoughts, perspectives, and stories.\n-Always kinda get the sense that the thing with her bf isn\u2019t perfect, she complains about it a bit, but she always seems committed to it, and I respect that.\n-We work a lot of extra hours together, make a lot of inside jokes, hang out after work almost every day, keep becoming closer.\n-Her bf moves up to town. Don\u2019t see her as much for a little bit. \n-Hang out with them both some. Get along with her bf, but he is a bit of a bro.\n-Sometimes weird hanging out with the them both, like I kinda have to think about what I say and don\u2019t talk about all the same things my coworker and I usually talk about when it\u2019s just us.\n-She laughs and tells me she accidentally called him my name and he\u2019s giving her shit about it. \n-She calls me his name when we\u2019re hanging out once.\n-Little things like that seem to keep happening\n-She tells me she had a dream where we kissed\n-At this point, she really has become my best friend, someone I care about deeply as a human being, and want the best for. I also do think she is incredibly beautiful and want to hold her hand and kiss her and lots more things sometimes, not like obsessing over it, just think about it sometimes. But maybe I just want that because she is beautiful and I have no other beautiful person to kiss and hold and whatnot rn. \n-It\u2019s starting to add up to more than a crush, but I\u2019m still not sure. I tend to be attracted when I think someone else is, and I keep getting these little signs that she might be. \n-Also value and enjoy our creative and professional relationship that has evolved.\n-Still don\u2019t get her relationship with bf, something seems strange, feel like she is more open and honest with me than she is him. She seems committed out of principle and not feeling. \n-Try not to make assumptions and just keep in the moment, still enjoy deeply all the time we spend together, and we keep spending a lot of it together. I still swipe on tinder and bumble, tell her about it. Hear things about her and the bf. \n-In this weird limbo where I\u2019ve realized I love my friend, but don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just creative platonic love that we\u2019ve developed, or if there is another side to it, or potentially more to it. \n-Think about sharing those feelings, but don\u2019t know how to and also scared to. Don\u2019t want to risk messing up our work relationship. Don\u2019t want to seem like some weird dude if I\u2019ve been misreading and she isn\u2019t into it. Don\u2019t want to complicate the thing with her boyfriend and put her in a difficult situation. I do want to be honest though. \n-Honest take is: \u201cI think I love you. Well I know I love you as a friend and I care for you and I want the best for you. And I have a nagging feeling that there is the potential for something more that could be really wonderful and you are as curious about that as I am. If I just got a clear answer that wasn\u2019t the case I really don\u2019t think I\u2019d have any trouble just being your friend.\u201d\n-Don\u2019t know how to say that. \n-She comes over last night, she\u2019s kinda drunk, I\u2019m tired and very stoned. Chat about life and things. Kinda weird pause, she says, I love you, sittingathomequietly. Then says I\u2019m the best work friend she has ever had. Can\u2019t tell if that was her saying like I LOVE you and then backpedaling and making it just seem friendly or if she was just saying like I love you and then following up to clarify she meant professionally and platonically. I say I love you too, but after a weird pause cause I\u2019m like \u201choly shit what did she just say, that\u2019s been on my mind the last couple week\u201d in my head. I say she\u2019s also been my best work friend ever. Want to talk further and clarify, but scared/stoned and don\u2019t know what to say. We awkwardly laughs and change back to some other subject. Go back to her house, she makes\nMac and cheese, I joke it\u2019s good b/c it\u2019s made with love. We laugh, but then kind awkward silence again. Her bf is outta town. I sleep over on the couch. \n-Can\u2019t stop wondering if she really might feel similarly to how I have, and I want to ask and/or share how I feel more clearly but am still terrified. Little scared of messing up a friendship, little scared I\u2019ve been reading things wrong and will seem weird,honestly more scared of the potential heartbreak of a new thing b/c I already care for this person so much it would start as something kinda serious if it did turn into anything more.\n\n\nHappy to hear and thoughts, comments, or concerns. \n\nMainly just wanted to share, nice to write that all down and get if off my chest.\n\nThanks for reading if you made it all the way through.", "title": "My coworker and I said I love you last night"}, {"created_utc": 1621108952, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/nd78d7/7_month_relationship_ended_please_read/", "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\nFirst of all, please, if there is any Community where I can post these kind of things, please send it down below, i couldnt find anything, thats why i am here.\n\n1 month ago, my ex-girlfriend broke up with me.

I accepted her in any way, i just wanted to be with her, thats it.\n\nBut know that she is gone, i realized how much i loved her.

Because of my emotions/feelings for her I was more sensitive when it was about here.

There\u2019s always a silent modifier at the end of that end sentence. It\u2019s only supposed to be three words, I love you.

I love you but forgive my abuse, forgive my manipulation, accept that I won\u2019t see your friends or family, accept that no can know about our relationship, and the list goes on. \n\nIt started with alcoholic parents and a dad who worked the weekends. I learned to make excuses at an early age for why my parents weren\u2019t at games or why I didn\u2019t invite friends to my house. My mother loved me but we won\u2019t talk about what happens. I love you but I can\u2019t protect you. My father loved me but asked forgiveness for his abusive outbursts. I love you daughter but forgive me when I commit suicide. \n\nI went to college and met my husband. We married and although he came from a religious family they didn\u2019t understand the words honor and love. My in-laws never pretended to love me and made their modifier clear. Perhaps harsh but at least we didn\u2019t have to skirt around the issue that I was not feminine enough and willing to worship my mother in-law. My husband filled my head with ideas of love but was the most manipulative of them all. I love you but don\u2019t be mad when I isolate you from friends and family. I love you but accept that you will be the primary bread winner, chef, maid, financial controller that I will constantly undermine, and responsible for ensuring I\u2019m happy. I love you but I\u2019m a covert narcissist who will verbally and emotionally abuse you. So my husband became my ex. \n\nThen my friend became my lover and that relationship came with a whole new set of modifiers. I will love you like no one ever has but we can\u2019t tell anyone about us, I\u2019m too old for you, we live too far apart to have a real future, I have responsibilities at home so I can never see you on a weekend, I have trust issues, and the list goes on. \n\nThere\u2019s always a justification that\u2019s said out loud which makes things more confusing and hides the modifier just under the surface enough that there\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s so easy to look at the full sentence when it\u2019s written in plain sight and be a critic but life can never be that simple and people can never be that easy to figure out.

I was nervous at first, mainly that I didn\u2019t see him as more than a friend, even though I found him physically attractive and thought he was a really good guy.\n\nOur first kiss was awkward, but we got into it, and then suddenly the physicality was really easy and it all just seemed to fit. We have met up a few times since, and shared a bed and cuddled and all that jazz.\n\nI feel so exposed now because I already feel like I love him, but I also feel like he deserved someone much better than I am. He\u2019s so much more cultured than I am (knows more history, can cook, has good taste in films) and I feel like I\u2019m just a bit embarrassing when I talk about nothing around him. I think I appeared much cooler before I opened up to him, and I wonder if he\u2019d have had a crush on me if he\u2019d realised quite how emotional and dramatic I can be. \n\nWe\u2019ve yet to have an argument, even though I\u2019ve voiced my disapproval on a choice of his, and he\u2019s always been so patient with me, hasn\u2019t raised his voice once, which always makes me feel like the immature party in this relationship because I\u2019m not as even tempered, although he doesn\u2019t make me angry, just random things/family drama. When I asked him to tell me ways that I irritate him, he only said that my forgetting I\u2019d already told him something was an issue. By my standards, he\u2019s extremely good to me (but I am used to everyone in my family telling me I talk too much, am annoying etc.) \n\nHe hasn\u2019t said \u201cI love you\u201d yet, so I daren\u2019t do it first, but when I think about him sometimes I say it to myself aloud and it makes me feel happier. One time that we were intimate I felt like he was telling me he loved me because he kissed my forehead and all over my face really gently, and nobody has ever treated me like I was so precious before. \n\nI\u2019m scared that my feelings are running away with me. I really believed he\u2019d be the kind of man I\u2019d be lucky to marry, but I\u2019m worried I don\u2019t deserve him and he\u2019s going to leave me once he realises that. I\u2019ve tried to tell him everything wrong with me and he\u2019s still apparently interested in pursuing a relationship, so hopefully this isn\u2019t a hiding to heartbreak! \n\nDo you think I should confess that I think I love him? \n\nShould I wait it out, in case he\u2019s not as serious as me and it\u2019ll only put pressure on him? He\u2019s much quieter than I am in general, and both of us struggle with depression from time to time, though his is the more important struggle as he\u2019s been closer to the edge than I have. I wonder if he might be as afraid of letting me in as I am him\u2026\n\nI really think he could be the love of my life, and I imagine a future with him so easily it actually scares me. I think perhaps I was too afraid to recognise the signs he wanted more than friendship because we are compatible and I didn\u2019t want to ruin it by showing him what an emotional mess I can be.\n\nIs it ok that I already am so invested in him? And is it less believable that I do love him when I know I\u2019ve felt love for people before and gotten burned because I was stupid about it? In my defence, I never had anyone who approached me in the gentle way he did, they were all more torrid romances. He feels so much more precious and genuine to me, and I want to be friends in any relationship I\u2019m in, so it seems logical to progress from friends to more, when we do fit physically etc. \n\nThanks for reading this, I just want to know if I\u2019m allowed to want someone I never deserved I suppose!

I eventually learned that he was having multiple affairs and came to the conclusion that I needed to get out. \n\nI was granted sole custody of our boys and we moved back home to be closer to my parents. Occasionally, my parents would force me to go on social outings with friends for the sake of my own sanity.

Subsequently, I learned she was only a year older than me, yet she had never been married and had no children.\n\nWe exchanged phone numbers and promised to keep in touch. I figured that I had just made another friendship, but this one felt different. She was so down to earth and didn\u2019t gossip about others the entire night, which was a breath of fresh air. She seemed like a genuinely good person with a good head on her shoulder and that was exactly the type of person I wanted to befriend during a period where I was already under enough stress. \n\nWe soon started meeting up, just the two of us, and I learned even more about her personal life. She revealed to me that she was gay and had known since she was just eight years old. She had come out of the closet years ago but hadn\u2019t had a serious relationship since high school. A spouse and kids were something she always wanted, but she felt it may never happen. I consoled her and opened up more about my own struggles over the past few years.\n\nWithin just a few months of knowing each other, we became best friends. We did something together nearly every weekend and she would come over to my place after work to play with the kids (who quickly came to adore her) and give me some \u2018rest time\u2019. I somehow didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but she was trying to make the point that she loved my boys and would do anything to be with me and raise them as her own.\n\nIt was during a lunch outing one afternoon that she revealed her feelings towards me. She told me that she didn\u2019t want it to change our relationship, but felt that it needed to be said that romance was on her mind. I told her that I needed to think about it. Quickly, I saw her facial expression go from nervous to sad. I started to think about everything in my head at that moment. Deep down, I had developed feelings for her as well. It was all just so confusing to me. I had never been into another woman like that and besides her, I could not find another woman \u2018attractive\u2019 even if I wanted to. \n\nI thought about all she had done for me and how great she was with my boys. Looking at her sad face, I grabbed her arm and told her that I wanted to be more than friends. Her expression changed to a mixture of shock and delight. I told her to ask me out. She did and we went on our first date the next evening. \n\nThings only got better from that point on. Our friends were shocked but beyond ecstatic for us upon hearing the news. She held my hand everywhere we went and always made it a point to declare that I was her girlfriend. I thought it was the cutest thing that she was obsessed with me. That\u2019s when I realized that we were probably going to get married. I had never had any interest in a woman prior to meeting her and now here I was on the verge of being married to one.\n\nShe proposed on our one year anniversary. We married in the most amazing destination wedding just seven months later. I quickly became pregnant and we welcomed our first daughter ten months after the wedding. Since then, we\u2019ve welcomed five more daughters and I have a seventh in my belly as we speak! Three years ago, my wife was promoted to CEO of her company. Despite holding such a powerful position, she always puts plenty of time aside for the kids and myself. I am beyond proud of her and honestly just honored to be able to do life with such an amazing person. \n\nI must say that I don\u2019t even see or think about her gender anymore. It\u2019s all pure love. We are soulmates. It\u2019s a type of love and emotion I never felt with a guy and sure wouldn\u2019t ever feel with any other woman. I love her for her and that\u2019s the most amazing feeling to be in love with someone just purely from the heart.", "title": "The story of how a single mother fell in love with another woman."}, {"created_utc": 1627933006, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/owm21k/i_27f_told_my_boyfriend_26m_i_loved_him_and_he/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "It took a lot for me to finally open up and say it through words.

They were beautiful, the vows were beautiful, the location was beautiful, and I couldn\u2019t be more happy for them. All the while, I reflected on my own marriage. \nI was a grocery store bagger, 16 years old, and wore baggy clothes with sagging pants (cut me some slack, it was the 1998 hip-hop era.) She was 18, a hot college student, and my favorite cashier. I\u2019ll never forget how she smiled at me. We\u2019d take breaks together and she took me out for my 17th birthday. She picked me up and I can still see her hair up in a bandana and that jean skirt. Call the priest...make arrangements...because I was a goner. She had a boyfriend that wasn\u2019t good and I had some maturing to do. We went separate ways for a year. She graduated, moved away, and then decided to return to look for me. I switched jobs and girlfriends every other week and was a little tough to find. One fateful night on Aug 25th, we ended up two tables apart at a pool hall. She was with her date and his 4 buddies and there was me with my two buddies. I went up to say hi and she had that same smile. She left her date and stayed at my table the rest of the night. We went to Dairy Queen the next 3 nights and just talked for hours getting to know each other and catching up. 16 days later, we said \u201cI love you.\u201d On Dec 12th, I proposed. July 21 we got married. I told everyone my age didn\u2019t matter because I couldn\u2019t love her any more if I were 35 than I did right then at 19. I was wrong.\nAt 39, 20 years of marriage later, I appreciate the subtleties of our marriage perhaps more than anything else. How she can read my eyes at all times and know what I feel, what I\u2019m thinking, and what I need without me speaking a word. How she can anticipate that touching my hand when in a public social event will bring my introverted and exhausted mind back to a calm place. How she selflessly supports my every decision and does so without hesitation. How she can balance my need to Right the Worlds Every Wrong (and probably prevent me from getting punched a few times!). How she never makes me justify my feelings. How she builds me up in front of other people rather than point out my flaws. \nSo as I watch single wedding attendees try to hook up and newlyweds just start their journey, I can\u2019t wait to fly back home to my boring, non-drinking, non-partying, stay at home on the sofa evenings, kidless, dog a plenty, ...simple life where my person, best friend, and wife are waiting.", "title": "I met The One at 16"}, {"created_utc": 1627927429, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/owk3kg/why_it_is_difficult_to_share_feelings/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "It's been a very tough time from couple of years.

There are a substantial number of fluctuations to that name these days, so I apologize. It could be \"Shennon\" too.\n\nI do not know if you remember me, nor know my name. But I remember you like yesterday, your eyes, your voice, your whole facial features. This whole reading might sound creepy or weird. I will not disagree because alas, it looks that way, so forgive me.\n\nI'm in love with you Shannon Sanjali. From the moment I saw you across the street and when our eyes crossed paths while you were getting onto a bus, I could not stop thinking about you. Grant it I was small, and I thought these feelings would depart. But they never did.\n\nWith a stroke of luck, we were able to meet, I thought it was destiny. The next statement might sound creepy, so here's a warning for you. As I was standing there shocked, you looked at me while drinking from a water bottle. I am being specific because I will never forget that moment. You looked so beautiful.\n\nI went home, couldn't sleep all night, It was you in my every thought. A week later, we met. I could understand you were shy, and you did not talk much that day. I was a bit nervous as well. Anyway, a day came when it was just the two of us.\n\nAgain, I thanked God for the moment and what inspired me from that point onwards. The \"tutor\" got up and when away, I thought this was it, time to introduce myself. Oh, and well your little sister was also there, so I kept it subtle. You might not remember, but I asked you about the day I saw you getting up on that bus, and you replied with yes, your voice never left my brain after that.\n\nNow in my mind, I was like \"OMG! She remembers me\" and afterward I asked you your name, where you lived, it went on to be a good conversation. I thought this was the beginning of something, but sadly it was not, and I did not get a chance to tell you what I wanted to say. Then that was the end of it.\n\nWe never talked much after that. We just say goodbye to each other every week when our sessions are over. You may never realize, but when you leave with your mother, I normally finish my work to get a few glimpses of you. I know, I know that it is stalking, and it was so wrong of me to do. But the funny thing is, we had the same routes, and you lived close to my house, so I had to take the same bus as you. Still, I should not have done that. Well, after I had left that \"class\", we never met face to face again.\n\nThe last time I saw you was in a nearby shop on our street with your mother and sister. I was in a vehicle, and you were wearing a bandage (by the way sorry about that). And well you looked at me, I guess we or at least I had this sense of similarity, I do not know what word goes there. But the point is that was it. We never met or saw each other again. Now here I am, after a couple of years finding a way to contact or at least hoping you would see this, to know if you had felt the same way. You might not remember me, because to be fair it was so long ago. Just know that I loved you, and I am thankful for the few moments we had together.

Words cannot describe the dismay I felt when I waved him goodbye at the airport and the sheer excitement when I finally saw him again. We clearly liked each other and went on a date, which lasted the entire day. And then met up again before he left. Note that we did not kiss or have sex - I honestly felt like I was attracted to his mind and him as a person rather than his appearance (though he is handsome), which is pretty rare for me. \n\nWe texted back and forth for 5 months or so before losing contact (he ghosted). At that point it was the first time ever that my heart felt that way, like it was sinking, to the point I wanted to vomit. I was distracted all the time and could not stop thinking about him. This was not the first time I\u2019d been ghosted, but it felt so awful that I was actually worried about my sanity at one point.

Today I saw a panel interview video of him and straight up bawled my eyes out when he came on. \n\nAfter all these years, he did not change his social media profile picture which was taken around the time we met (not saying he kept it for me, but my stupid mind wants to believe it). Then I felt ridiculous and pathetic because he clearly does not miss me. This scares me. We knew each other for such a short period of time and didn\u2019t even officially date.

So I'm(21m) a freelance delivery driver, driving food around for local restaurants/bars. Been doing it for a few months now. Honestly I enjoy it a lot and it's helped me out tremendously with social anxiety; plus it's nice to actually get some sun haha. \n\nI haven't been dating for a while now because I realized I need to work on myself. Lately I've been feeling the outcome of this; I've felt more like myself than I have in a very long time and now I'm very content with my own company. I've picked back up on my favorite hobbies like music, books, photography, cooking, fashion. \n\nEven though I haven't had any intentions of getting into a relationship in months, there's a new hostess at one of these restaurants I deliver for. Usually people don't catch my attention but something about this woman grabbed my attention and caught me completely off guard. Like, wow is really the only way I can describe her haha. So now I've got a bit of a crush on her. F@&amp;k me right?\n\nEvery now and then when I'm waiting for an order there I\u2019ll notice her looking at me. Usually for a longer time than what\u2019s considered a glance. Her eyes also light up a bit when I show up. All that being said I am also a bit of an overthinker and don't exactly gloss over most subjects. \nMy biggest issue is that I've always maintained a position that I don't want to date within my professional life. I also am usually opposed to asking out anyone while they're working; especially waitresses, bartenders, Ect as I feel it's very inappropriate. \n\nSo my question/questions would be: what are your thoughts? what should I do? Should I ask her out? Also if I do, how would I go about it? I'm not very good at this kind of thing.

Hi. I'm 14. Yes, young, very young in fact in comparison to 99% of most people around here. And before you stop taking this post seriously due to my age, please hear me out. I want to tell you about my situation.\nFor reasons which I'll tell you about later, I'm quite a closed person. And I needed to finaly tell someone about this. It's 11 pm around here right now so I might as well wake up tomorow and slap myself in the face for posting this, but whatever. Ok, I'm 14, I live in the Czech Republic, I am in the 8th grade of elementary school (there are 9 grades). I'm 4.95 ft. That's pretty ridiculous. It's due to two factors, first is because my father is very short too, and second, is that my body is basicaly over 1 year younger than it should be. It's something I've had to live with since I was born, and I accepted it, and I wouldn't change it too much if I had the option. Infortunately, this is ruining my social life. I can't talk to girls. I mean, it's inpossible when you are a head shorter than all of them. There is a girl I'm attracted to. I so desperately wan't to establish at least a bit of a conection. But I can't. \n\nBut that's not my main concern. It's the thought, that it will be like this for years that realy frustrates me. I see all people around me having their first relationships. Their first hugs, the first kisses. All of that is slipping through my fingers and I can't do anything about it. All of this would be fine (not realy), if it wasn't for this one girl. I've felt something for her since I was a tiny kid. I mean like 5 years old or so. She is very smart, reasonable and kind. I so desperately wish I could talk to her. At least try to. But there is no way. And this is not like I'm afraid she wouldn't like me, it's because I know for a fact that it's impossible for any girl to be attracted to someone like me, and of course not even I could be in such \"relationship\" because it would be more than embarassing and awkward to be with a girl half a feet taller than you. \n\nI have learned to burry these feelings deep within myself, not letting them out, since letting them out would only cause more sadness. This feeling, that I can't and won't be able to live what nearly everyone can, is starting to eat me from inside. \n\nMy very best friend, who I know since we were 3 years old, has just started dating with a girl. He is slim and tall, and it's only narural that he is attractive for many girls. I feel very happy for him. But at the same time, I incredibly envy him.\n\nBecause of that, my self confidence is about as low as it has ever been. When you are this short, everyone around you (appart from my best friends, without which my life would have been a pain to go through, for many other reasons appart from this one), will not take you as someone of their \"level\". They won't comunicate with you like with someone of the same age. And I can't blame anyone for that. But it's incredibly frustrating. I feel completely disconected from the people around me. I feel like I'm not supossed to be there. There are things that remind me of this everywhere. From random people staring at me, from people making jokes, to way more simple things like mirrors. It's like getting slapped over and over from all sides every day. It's so demotivating. Even when I'm alone doing my stuff, my brain always brings up the thought that, that girl you love, will never ever even have the slightest bit of interest in you. No other girl will either. And there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. \n\nIt's not like I'm going through depressions or any other psychical problems, it's just I feel incredibly emotionaly empty. I feel alone.\n\nThank you for reading, and sorry for my poor endglish.\n.", "title": "I feel incredibly alone and empty.

It\u2019s honestly stronger than any relationship we have. We talk about serious stuff and we have fun a lot, so everything balances out our relationship. We call for hours on end and I don\u2019t think anything is gonna break that bond we have together. \n\nWe do and share everything together, we even have an app that we have called tuned and we occasionally send each other shit, he even dyed his hair to be like mine! ( It\u2019s half brown and half black ) Honestly, we\u2019re like twins- ( Not really if anyone was getting worried \ud83d\udc40) But we do sleep on the phone together, have the same interests, and we\u2019re both jokers as well.\n\nBut.. As every couple has, me and my boyfriend do go though some fights sometimes or disagree at points but it doesn\u2019t really go anywhere bad because at the end of all of this, we do still love each other with our hearts, not all relationships are just happy, every relationship does have their twists and turns but most of them work out in the end and I\u2019d they don\u2019t, and if they don\u2019t talking about it with your partner somehow makes the conversation better. If you ever have those problems and you and your partner can\u2019t figure it out, go to a guidance counselor together. \n\nBut yeah, I think this relationship will work out, we usually go on this virtual reality game together called Rec Room ( It\u2019s on mobile and pc too- ) And it\u2019s honestly amazing, since I don\u2019t get to see him in person, I get to talk to him on Rec Room, and we have, a, fucking, blast. We go on all of these games together and beat quests, earn prizes and mostly talk about stuff and have fun. If you\u2019re into that stuff you should get Rec Room. It's amazing to make friends, play games or find a lover.. \n\nHonestly I could go on and on all night about the both of us, but that will be sometime later when I feel more out to talk about it. Maybe today? Or the next day? But right now, I gotta focus on us and be there for him every step of his way. Even though we haven\u2019t met in real life, I think if we really work hard, and fill ourselves with trust, talking this out and just be there in general, I think we can be a really good dream team couple. \n\nNow, I wanna give some self awareness tips to anyone out there whom might be struggling with a relationship right now or just can\u2019t find anyone right or, just any relationship problems in general.;  Don\u2019t give up love, no matter what you\u2019re going through, a lot of people do love you and you gotta be proud of yourself, you need to care about yourself and love yourself before you can love anyone else, you are the main priority of your life, specifically saying you are the main character, you control everything you do, say and act, think of it like as life\u2019s main game, but there isn\u2019t a way to win it, you gotta earn it by time, and patience. No matter if you\u2019re a in person couple or just talking to them in front of a screen, they do love you no matter how much you think they don\u2019t, in their heart, they have a special place for you, and in that special place of course holds you, so if you ever feel sad or don\u2019t feel like anyone appreciates you or again- Anything in general, know that there is gonna be a person, or just people that love you no matter what. Anyways I\u2019ll stop in my tracks here, I hope I helped anyone dealing with problems or having a hard time expressing feelings. thanks for anyone who has stayed here and listened to my story and my self awareness, stay woke, stay safe, keep watch for any signs..

I was fine with that, since it was only 8 weeks and  in the end we\u2019d be able to be back together again. So of course it was sad saying goodbye to him the last time, but he gave me his sweatshirt to just have to keep a part of him while he was gone. Before he left he told me how much he loved me and would never leave me.\nThe problem occurred the day that he left. I was having a bad day and wasn\u2019t feeling as talkative as normal, so when he FaceTimed me while he was driving somewhere there wasn\u2019t much conversation. Later that night, he started talking about how hard it\u2019s going to be for him to have a relationship while in the Air Force. I understood that but told him we\u2019d make it work. He disagreed and when I asked him why, he said that he wanted to be single. When I asked him if he still loved me, he said \u201cnot anymore\u201d. After dealing the final blow and him saying goodbye to me, he blocked me on everything, leaving me completely blindsided and alone. I want to find him again when he comes home.. but is it really worth waiting for him to come home just for the possibility of him saying he made a mistake and get my boyfriend back? Or will I just be heartbroken again when the man I love comes back and wants nothing to do with me? I just don\u2019t know what to do.. I don\u2019t want to let him go because I love him more than anything.. but I also don\u2019t want to be devastated if he doesn\u2019t want me back. What should I do?

I'm 19 year old male, who is currently studying electrical engineering at an university. I just want to get this off my chest.\n\nSo basicly there is one girl (18f), that I've known for about 4 years now. I got to know her, because our fathers are friends. We also live closeby. I enjoy walking with my dog at lonely roads between fields and forests, when it's about to go dark. She enjoys going for a walk at the night too, so we sometimes randomly see each other. We always have long conversations and she is always happy to see me. We also had some planned hangouts too, like working together etc.\nI just can't understand if she likes me or not. She clearly enjoys talking with me and sometimes I feel she is into me, but I'm not 100% sure. I'm afraid getting it awkward between us by asking her to a date.\n\nThe problem is that I keep thinking about her and even seeing her in my dreams. I feel nothing towards other girls, they all look and seem to be the same. 2 weeks ago at a party I was dancing with other girls and felt little bit better. I still didn't feel anything towards that girl who started to kiss me, but it got this girl out of my mind for a little bit. BUT then next day I met her again while walking with my dog. We walked together and talked for about a hour, even though it was cold, dark and foggy. We talked about books and she randomly mentions love genre, which is kinda odd. When I'm about getting little bit over her, she randomly appears again and it drives me crazy. I'm otherwise rational man, but she is the only girl that managed to dig her way deep into my heart. Never felt anything like this towards other person before and it's exhausting.\n\nI feel like I have no choice anymore - I just have to risk it and ask her to a actual date. I have never asked a girl to a date before, because I have never actually cared about love or girls before. Hopefuly I manage to ask her to something romantic date-like thing next time we randomly meet at lonely forest roads... \n\nDamn, this became such a novel, but my heart feels little bit lighter now.

I've known her as an acquaintance for a few years, and didn't really interact with her for a year during the pandemic. I had a bit of a crush on her to begin with, but nothing too strong. I think she did for me too. But now we see each other somewhat regularly again, as part of a group of friends. \n\nNow she's always on my mind and I can't stop thinking of her. When I go without seeing her for a while the intoxicating feeling diminishes if I don't think about her actively, but soon after I see her again it's like I can't get her out of my head and want to be close with her emotionally and physically. I don't really know her that well as a person, but we often make small talk when we meet amongst our friendship group. \n\nI think she likes me too. She always seems to come over to me specifically to talk and has a big smile and glowing eyes whenever we speak. The two of us often chat together when amongst others, and I never get the impression she wants to stop speaking with me to chat with others. I do feel there is a presence and tension between us whenever we interact.\n\nWe walked part of the way to our homes together the other evening after being out with friends, and I think that's the longest we've been alone together before. I felt super conscious of everything and hyper-aware throughout. After saying goodbye, she  text me a few minutes later about a trivial practicality from earlier in the evening, and said she was looking forward to chatting with me again this coming weekend (I'll be in a small group with her again), with a smiley face emoji. \n\nI feel so incredibly drawn to her, and I can't get her out of my head. The problem is, I feel in no way ready for a relationship: I got divorced at the start of this year, following a couple of years of separation from my ex. I'm in therapy at the moment for anxiety, OCD and other things. And once this is over, I'm starting to finally feel ready to explore my sexuality after growing up in an evangelical context, marrying young as a virgin and enduring a long and very hard marriage of about 10 years. I want to explore my bisexuality for the first time, and to have some sexual experiences that most people tend to have in their late teens and twenties. I also plan to work on my career, move away from the area next year, and to hopefully move abroad too. \n\nSo it seems that it would be irresponsible to pursue her at this time, or to lead her on in any way. And moreover, I really want to do these other things for myself and to focus on them.\n\nBut it really hurts me to be around her and know all this. The conflict is really hard to manage. I want to pursue her so much, but then I also want to finally start living on my own terms as a single man and start pursuing some other goals that would not be compatible with being in a stable relationship.\n\nI also don't know if I could be in a short-term, casual relationship with her. My feelings for her are very strong and I don't want to hurt her or myself. And we'd still have to to see each other in future when out with our mutual friends.\n\nI really don't know what to do with this conflict, and I worry she might ask me out. It feels like this is what's going to happen if I don't ask her first. That would be both wonderful and terrifying. I'm finding it really hard to deal with this internal conflict and my mind is all over the place. I just want to focus on my therapy and pursue my personal and professional desires and goals.

I used to enjoy it, Im on bc and have been since I was 16, I changed my bc recently but I dont think it has anything to do with it because at the time of me starting to not enjoy or like sex anymore I was on the same bc I was on when I started taking it.

The Turtle Bracelet/Anklet (Kurma) (He tried selling it off as both the cheeky bastard :D)\n\nOnce again, in Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu has been on earth in both animal and human forms, many believe that the story behind Sri Vishnu and his appearances on earth explain evolution before Darwinism, we call the evolution of Sri Vishnu 'Dashavatar'.

The Owl Anklet\n\nThe Owl is my favourite bird; it's got beautiful big eyes and I love the sound of it hooting... you've got beautiful big eyes, and I also love it when you... hoot :D\n\n5.) The feather earings\n\nI guess I just thought they would look sexy on you. Kek :D\n\nSo there are my birthday gifts to you.

Isn't it interesting that the universe has a way in playing with people's hearts and lives?\n\nI daresay that it is my chance now to push on with my plans and to show her how I feel about her and how much she means to me. I have learned to trust her and respect her that I surely would love to take good care of her and to always reassure my love for her both in words and in action. I do feel comfortable and secure with her. I will always choose her at the end of the day because of the similarities we share and a few differences too. \n\nI want her to be a partner with equal standing and I want communication to be vital here. I strive to keep everything toxic-free. I do have my issues and baggages too so I am learning to love myself too one day at a time. I do not want to project them into what could be our relationship. I will be mindful and aware of this. \n\nI want to show that she too can be loved and do everything I can to inspire her to love herself even more. I want to guide her throughout life in accomplishing her dreams and ambitions and I will always strive to be with her both in the best and the worst times. The beauty of it all is we have established a friendship unlike any other and the emotional intimacy is already there. \n\nI have always have been a hopeless romantic confronting with pangs of unrequited love with fantasies of obsession and idealisms on what it is like to be with a girl I like. But this one is different, the way I feel about her is something else, otherworldly. I see myself in her in many of the instances. I have never been so empathic in my life until she came along recently. Our emotional connection is just crazy even when we first chatted. \n\nWe haven't met yet and she would want to meet me and boy I really feel the same. And in our conversations I notices hints and clues, though they are subtle, that she is into me but is actually afraid to admit it because she is currently recovering from her heartbreak. I am patient as I give her space and time. I do not want to rush things with her. I do not mind her not replying during chat for a while because I fully trust in her that she will eventually reply back. It is clear in my mind that she also does cherishes me and our bond. \n\nI do love so much, time will come she will truly realize it. If she loves me back in a romantic sense, great! If she friendzones me because of fear, then that would be fine too. I do not fear rejection with her because I will still love her either way.\n\nI get this feeling that if I love her more I feel loved even more. Give her my love makes me feel loved and that is hope important she is to me. She has changed my life. And I think I have never been this loved before especially with another beautiful human being like her. \n\nI see no reason for us to part and I will fight everyday to always choose her no matter how I feel for love is a choice and a decision to maintain the relationship to its ultimate potential. I want to see her grow and to support her with everything I have. I want to nurture her and assist her overcome all of her insecurities. I want her to live a wonderful life, a meaningful life and the best life she could imagine and I am all in to support her. That alone will make me very happy because that sure matters a lot. And don't worry, I trying hard to take care of myself too. \n\nI have always had a fear of rejection and intimacy but somehow along the way these fears dissipate. I see her in my future.

She's very pretty, very much my type. She first walked over to me, asking me for a light. And i was stressed out yesterday slightly. I didn't talk much while she smoked. she talked about how she left her boyfriend, and i slightly entertained it for a couple minutes. She was attracted to me and she has no idea now how much into her i was. As she was finishing her smoke, I acted like a hobo and said 'hey can you save me the last of that'... which made her feel guilty....\n\nshe said 'well you should have asked sooner i would have shared'\n\ni knew that ahead of time, but i didn't ask because all i could think of was leaving my saliva on it.\n\nshe has no idea that i has mononucleosis before, and i was affraid to tell her, and i didn't want her to have it... so now instead of me chilling down and talking with her for her to get to know me even just LITTLE BIT... she probably went off deciding against me today. Before she left me last night she said that we should hang out today... so she said 9:30, and I said i'd be here outside at 9.\n\nI spent a while last night thinking about her. I thought about her this morning when i woke up. I took some time to myself and meditated while i thought about her. I thought i set my alarm, but i got out of it at 9:02 and literally ran 1/4 mile to meet her at 9:08. so she wasn't there and i went on blaming myself being hard on myself for not being willing to give her mononucleosis last night....\n\nor she would have seen about me... and not therefore gone into a self-blame thing (which is my presumption). i think that with the time wasted today and the time i screwed up last night, that she ended up deciding that she was after me as a 'rebound guy'. but THATS NOT TRUE AND NOT HOW IT WAS.\n\ni just didn't talk enough, didn't say i had mono, didn't say that im not a sleazy guy trying to hook up with her (in my own way) WHICH SHE DIDN'T EVEN ASSUME...\n\nshe asked me what type of girls im into. and i was honest and said someone actually like you, i guess. So, she didn't disbelieve that last night.. and im afraid that TODAY she concluded i only wanted her as an 'option' or 'in her pants' type thing.\n\nso i've been staving off being mad about this, to not contaminate the possiblility of meeting her and being comfortable around her again... but that takes a toll too, leaving me uncertain, and only left with hope to rely on....

She is the cutest.\n\nWe go to the same school, so naturally we saw each other again today. This is a short story of what happened as I wanted to gush to someone about it, enjoy!\n\nIt's first period. While the teacher is droning on about politics and jobs, I keep stealing glances at the clock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. How I wish time could move faster for me, just this once.\n\nNow, I'm not usually one to slack off in class, so I'm surprised at how absolutely soul-crushingly difficult paying attention seems right now. This girl's like a lone ranger riding through the wild west in my mind - and oh boy is she holding the reins tight. The memory of her touch is the blistering, blazing breeze of the desert, ever present and ever potent. I can almost still feel her hand in mine if I focus hard enough. I can almost still smell her perfume.\n\nAfter what feels like hours of chitchat about the job market and what we imagine our futures will be - yadda yadda - the bell rings. Hallelujah! \n\nBarely able to contain my excitement, I offer a quick 'byeimgoingtomygirl' to my friends, who give me understanding smiles and nods, before rushing out onto the schoolyard. \n\nI scan through the crowd. No, that's Billy. And that's Peter. Is that her- no, that's just the local wannabe instagram influencer.\n\nThen I see her. She's standing there, in all her beauty, her wavy strawberry blonde locks crashing over her shoulders like waterfalls. Her checkered jacket compliments the ankle-length skirt she's wearing perfectly, I notice as I approach. She's turned away from me, seemingly oblivious to my presence - though her friends seem all but, shooting me curious looks. \n\nShe's startled when she finally notices me. I don't give her any time to react, though, wrapping her in my arms and burying my face in her neck. She smiles into the crook of mine and hugs back. I think I'm going to melt; The warmth is overwhelming. \n\nNeither one of us is planning on letting go, it seems, because we stand there for what must be at least 10 seconds cradling each other before either of us gets the idea to pull away.\n\n\"You smell nice,\" is the first thing she says.\n\nI chuckle, having absolutely no idea how to counter that. \"Thanks. You too.\"\n\nHer friends share a strange look and continue conversing. \"So, one thing you never do at a Russian's house is whistle. That's what I have to keep telling guests,\" her best friend explains. \n\n\"Well, good thing I can't whistle, then,\" the other friend answers, \"I'll keep it in mind if I ever visit, though.\" \n\nThe conversation passes like a blur as I stand there, staring at my girl. I don't even notice as the bell rings. Before I know it, she's holding me in her arms again. I tell her to have fun in her next class as I mentally prepare to engage my master plan of buying her breakfast in the city during the free lessons I have. She lingers, her hands in mine, and stares, her eyes a piercing but somehow a surprisingly warm, tranquil green. I'll never get enough of that look, I think. Not anytime soon.\n\nEventually, the moment ends and I'm left alone again. I walk to the city and get her a black tea - her favorite - along with a sweet glazed bun. \n\nThe second break comes around after a while of me browsing reddit on my phone to pass the time. I go to the yard once again and hand her the little breakfast package. Confusion flashes over her eyes for a second before quickly being replaced by gratefulness. \"You bought me breakfast? You didn't have to!\" she practically whines as she pulls me into another hug. \n\n\"I did, if it's for my girl,\" I laugh. \"Oh- sorry, the tea may be kind of cold. I didn't know what you wanted, so there's white sugar, brown sugar and sweetener in the bag.\" \n\nShe gapes at me. \"You really got the whole package, didn't you?\" Her bestie seems amused, smirking at us from the side.\n\nWe make our way to a bench in the corner of the yard and I take a seat next to her. She leans against me. We laugh a bit about something I can't remember. I feel her trembling, and it's a chilly morning, so I gently cup her hand. She looks up at me. I can almost swear I see sparkles in her eyes - they look like little droplets of morning dew in the sun. \n\nI must be the luckiest girl on the planet, I think to myself. We make friendly banter, the classics - this project is killing me; I got an A for my presentation, bless the heavens; I don't want to go back to school... \n\nAll I can focus on is her hand in mine and her small form slumping against me. 'Is this sudden urge to pamper her and give her a million kisses normal?' I ask myself. I can't seem to find an answer. I make a mental note to Google it later.\n\nThe break ends, the bell continuing its streak of ruining the moment yet again. \"I won't be at school tomorrow,\" I tell her before we go our separate ways. \"We're going on this trip with our class.\"\n\n\"You've gotta be kidding me,\" she deadpans, the disappointment clear in her voice.\n\n\"I know. If it were up to me, I'd stay here just to see you again.\" I squeeze her hand.\n\nShe grins, squeezing back. \"Well, see you on Wednesday, then,\" she says before disappearing into her classroom, looking back to give me one last smile.\n \n\"Yeah. See ya,\" I yell after her.\n\nThe rest of the day, I don't expect to see her again (since we don't have any long enough breaks to meet up in the schoolyard). So you can imagine my surprise when after 6th period I'm walking down the hall and stop to look around for my friends, only to find myself practically tackled by the girl. \n\n\"Woah,\" I exclaim as I try to regain my balance and prevent both of us from falling on the (probably very cold and dirty) floor. \n\n\"Why can't you just stay?\" she suddenly whispers into my chest. It comes out of nowhere. My heart clenches like it's just been punched. I tenderly stroke her back in an effort to comfort her; She seems to sink deeper and deeper into my embrace. At this point, I'm afraid of moving her, lest she break into a million pieces in front of me like an expensive sculpture. \n\n\"I'm sorry, I have another lesson today. And then choir,\" I murmur into her hair.\n\nThere's a sea of people around us - some are starting to stare, some are whispering. Some don't even seem to notice. \n\nBut in that moment, I don't care. I don't care how long I have to hold my girl to make her feel better. I don't care what kind of rumors people start telling. I just want to be hers. I want her to have me, as long as that makes her as happy as it does me.", "title": "Best Monday ever."}, {"created_utc": 1634573230, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/qaprml/not_sure_what_to_title_this/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "Please bear with me as this might be all over the place.

I go to college in upstate NY but live 30 mins outside NYC. I met this girl about 6 months back through mutual friends and social media and we immediately clicked. That type of connection you only see in movies where that person is YOUR person. The same version of you but the opposite gender. We\u2019ve been officially together for about 2 months now and this is technically my first real relationship. Whenever I\u2019m with her, time stops and I feel at peace. I feel like nothing else matters. She\u2019s caring, affectionate, she\u2019s quite literally everything I could ever ask for in a girl. I have deep rooted trusted issues due to previous experiences and I feel like my own brain is trying to sabotage my happiness and tell me that there has to be some type of catch. Whenever she has an interaction with a guy I get worried/upset because I feel as I\u2019m easily replaceable. I\u2019m worried about being replaced by another guy and I\u2019m worried these thoughts will ruin the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. \n\nSide note: She lives in the town I go to college in and we\u2019re gonna do the long distance thing in between semesters. \n\n\nI tell her about these thoughts and she constantly reassures me. She doesn\u2019t get mad at me for having these thoughts and talks it through with me. I\u2019ve met her family and she\u2019s meeting mine next week. It feels like I\u2019ve known her an eternity. We talk about the future together and get into specifics on how we can make the relationship work after college and how it\u2019s \u201c me and you vs the world\u201d. \n\n\nI know I\u2019m only 19 and she\u2019s my first girlfriend so part of me is thinking I\u2019m crazy for thinking she\u2019s the one but it truly feels like it. I met her when I was in such a dark place and she helped me escape it and brightens my world every single day. \n\nBack to my questions, is it wrong/ crazy for me to have the idea that she\u2019s the one? I believe if you date someone but can\u2019t see yourself with them in the long term, then you\u2019re wasting your time and only dating for heartbreak.\n\nSecondly, how do I stop those thoughts of doubt ? In my heart I know I trust her, I\u2019m just so scared of losing her. \n\n\nThank you to anyone\u2019s who\u2019s read this entire thing. I would appreciate any words of wisdom.

He said he still loved me but the feeling wasn't as strong as the beginning, while my feelings're growing everyday, which hurt me a bit. He doesn't open up about his problems, I get it he got hurt once, he went through a lot, and this's still relatively new. \n\nHe once told me he thought he wasn't ready for a relationship right now because he hasn't figured out himself yet, but we talked and he still wanted to give this relationship a try so I stayed, and he thanked me for that. But since then, I love him so much that I'm always afraid that he's gonna leave me, which led me to showing my love too much and maybe become annoying. I don't know if he thinks I love him a lot that I'll never leave and takes me for granted, but I also think maybe he won't really mind if I leave because he isn't ready anyway. He's made efforts to communicate with me since he doesn't like texting, but I kept bringing up about how little we spent time with each other, I think that exhausted him but he didn't want say so, so I don't really know where he stands right now. He's wonderful when we're together, but when we're not, I can't really feel it. \n\nMany friends told me I should feel happy in a relationship, not wonder and have second thoughts. But I can't just leave this, I love him, I love his family, I hate the idea of getting to know someone, getting attached, and one day just becoming strangers again.

I knew love existed, and there are those that experience it, I just never believed it was meant for me, and if it was, would have to go through years and years before I see some semblance of it. \n\nAs a kid, I didn't think love was for me at all. Mostly because nearly all of my family members were either single or divorced, including my dad, who had the ugliest divorce from my mom long before I could even remember, so much that to this day there's still bad blood between them. And I'm pretty sure which has traumatized my dad into staying out of the marriage and dating game as we speak. The closest thing I got to romantic love would be the fictional kind, seeing my fav characters get together in books and movies.\n\nThen I grew older, and the pressure to find a bf due to my friends all finding crushes and fear of me being left out got to me. That was when in junior year I met my first bf, who we'll call Paul. He and I fortunately are on good, but still awkward terms.\n\nI had a crush on him because he was the only guy who looked past my awkward and introverted personality and got me to open up more. He liked me because apparently I was the only one who didn't just treat him like a Class Clown character, and saw him as someone to be taken seriously. I confessed first, and that started about 2 years worth of being slightly more than friends and painfully awkward attempts at flirting. I wasn't his first gf, in fact I was his 6th, but I thought it was love because of how much he liked me and I liked him, despite it all. I thought these kind of things, like actual dates and flirting, took time to manifest, and everything would go smoothly from there once they do. I waited and waited, but that easy feeling of being with someone you like that I see everywhere, never occured between us.\n\nAnd the rift just grew when he confessed, nearly a year into us \"dating\", that he had kissed someone else, and only told me 2 weeks after the incident and his uncle guilt tripped him into it.\n\nThe me now would have run him over, but the me then, still wanted to keep him and blamed myself for going to another girl. He asked to meet, then apologized and begged me to stay with him, and I forgave him almost immediately. \n\nLooking back it wasn't just the betrayal. It was the fact that this girl, who he's known only a few weeks, had kissed him when Paul had yet to even kiss me on the cheek. It hurt more than anything that this girl received what should have been my first kiss. He did kiss me, but after that day yet...it didn't feel right. Nothing felt right anymore.\n\nI fought with it since then, talking to him like normal, but each day I was fighting with that uncomfortable feeling, which grew even more. Holding a conversation with him for more than five minutes felt awkward, sitting next to him felt awkward, having him kiss me felt awkward, and even maintaining eye contact felt awkward. Everything was awkward, and wrong, so very wrong.\n\nDuring my freshman year of college, I was done waiting for things to get better, for things to run smoothly. It was suffocating just thinking about enduring any more of the discomfort a day longer. So, I broke it off, giving him my reasons, and although it hurt, it felt liberating. And it was for the best too, for both of us.\n\nI decided that year to put all my time into school, friends and myself. Love could come much later, when I have my life together. And besides, I didn't need the kind of mushy, cutesy, addictive kind of love you see in movies. I stopped believing in that kind of love long before then.\n\nBut of course, that's exactly what life decided to give me about a year later, through my bf, and love of my life.

She is smart. She is fun and clever and witty. She is deep as the ocean warm as the sun. I knew it immediately when we met. Every day the feeling intensifies. Every deep conversation brings new levels of appreciation and respect for the quality individual she is. My stomach roils when I imagine being together and my heart pounds. Every day, without exception, I have this experience. I've been totally open and earnest about my feelings, and burst into tears while explaining it to her multiple times. She looks me in the eyes and tells me she loves me, and i truly feel it. We are becoming best friends, yet she is not at a time in her life when she's ready for romantic love. She is morning the death of the man she had been convinced was her one true love - a tragedy just weeks before we met. I truly feel for her loss. If I could bring him back I'd give him my place in the world so she could have the love she dreamt of. I would do this in an instant, without jealousy or regret, but with joy to deliver the love she truly deserves. I would wait forever for her, quietly, respectfully, patiently, and supportive of how she chooses to live her life even if it is not with me. The affection I feel is expansive, endless. This love gives color and texture to my world. It's as if there's an aura of light from within her. I see it, I sense it, I know it is there impossibly cruising over from some ethereal dimension.\n\nThe budding friendship is so beautiful and mature. We can share our deepest feelings openly. We are housemates. Total strangers who fit so perfectly that we have never had a single conflict. No minor irritations or pet peeves. Zero. It's really remarkable. Two people truly love and respect one another, observe and read one another, sense to the smallest needs of each other. It is love with depth and dimension I have not known... Not to the woman I married and had children with. Not with anyone. Not like this. \n\nSo I wait, and sometimes I suffer the uncertainty. Why do I want more love, romantically, sexually... complete togetherness? What we already have is truly perfect. I wish I could internalize this, and feel content with what we have. My mind obsesses with 'what ifs,' even though I'm realistic that I will not likely ever be her lover. Sometimes I feel like Lloyd Christmas -- hopelessly enthusiastic with 1-in-a-million odds.\n\nWhat is going on inside me? I want to believe that God brought us together to fall in love, but it's arrogant to imagine God would deem me deserving of her. Maybe it's my need for this feeling. Perhaps she just happened along and the feelings I needed to feel became affixed to her. I turn my thoughts to the rational perspective. Is this intense, beautiful, boundless feeling reducable to electrochemical activity of my nervous system. A chemical soup of hormones is pumping through my heart. Dopamine and oxytocin saturate cells parched and starved after a decade alone. If so, I am addicted to these chemicals. \n\nI am terrified to lose the possibility of her selecting me, and equally nervous to imagine what it would feel like to be her lover. I am beyond grateful to have the time and love and attention we are sharing. \n\nWhat can I do now? I will show her true kindness, gentle understanding, compassion for her emotions, and respect for her choices. And I will know that I am doing right by her. I will work to understand how to manage my emotions so it's not so extreme, so we can simply enjoy the special relationship as it presently exists, without expectation or pressure or impatience. She gives me the motivation to be a better man, and I take strength from this. She has already saved my life, helping me lose 55 pounds by cooking healthy nutritious meals every day, and by giving me the confidence to do it.

A few days ago, I played a somewhat-new title that turned my whole world upside down. Finished it today and I just... couldn't not fall in love with one of the main characters. This sort of thing has never happened with me before, and the most depressing part is that I know exactly why it did. This specific character, she was unequivocally... genuine. Charismatic. Likable to an insurmountable degree. And dynamic, to a point that I envisioned her as someone other than just a game character (If anyone's wondering, I'm referring to Judy Alvarez from Cyberpunk 2077). And that's the hardest part of it all. No matter how much I knew, with utmost certainty, that this was a facade, I couldn't stop myself from comparing her to all the girls I've ever met and interacted with, and how they fall so far short simply because I'm comparing them to her. I'm reconsidering my life and all the emptiness I feel right now since it juxtaposes with the sheer joy I had when developing a relationship with her over the past few days. I feel hollowed-out.

Going to dinner tonight and seeing all my cousins happy with their partners and everyone consoling my one cousin who\u2019s going through a divorce. Everyone knew Jessie and I broke up but no one said anything to me. I get a divorce is bigger but you can at least pat me on the back and say it\u2019s ok.

I need to work on myself first but the idea of not knowing what\u2019s ahead is scary. Iv tried throwing myself into my hobbies and working extra shifts just to keep myself from being home alone.

It\u2019s been over a month since I had my heart ripped out and I feel no better than the day it happened. I\u2019m drinking more and feeling like shit. Had a one night stand with a co worker, something I would never have done before. I feel like this breakup is making me a worse person and I feel like I have no one I can talk to. Everyone I know is going through worse stuff right now. So I just had to type this all out and hope some of you kind people can offer me som kind words.

Im a preety horny type of person, i get romantic after alcohol and all that stuff. But after the horniness and alcohol is gone, i turn into a preety cold, lets say \"calculating\" guy? Im sorry but english isnt my first language and i dunno how to explain that better. Im not into zodiacs but ive read about my sign, and if someone is into them Aquarius really is on point in explaining my personality. I also have a huge problem with displaying my emotions, even when inside im humiliated and in mental agony on the outside i just seem calm.\n\n I think my first girlfriend was really my first love, despite the age i was in. Ive been crushing her literally since the first time i saw her, she had the eyes, the lips, the interests and personality. But the only problem was she was 3 years older, and me barely turning 14, i was still mentally a child, and now when i think of it, i cant get over the fact i ruined a chance with a girl such as her. I think we would be perfect if i was with her NOW, but that's the past. And how it ended? Me getting bored and not giving enough fucks about her. You can judge me, i deserve it.\n\nMy 2nd real crush was a girl that i only had internet contact with but she also matched my personality. She was as kinky as me, had as many artistic interests as me, humour, etc. One time we were really close to being together and she 100% knew i was into her A LOT, but i planned to ask her out when ill go to her city by train. I was supposed to ride there at sunday, in friday she told me she is with a different guy, and though it did hit me hard and i got over it, i think subconsciouslly it changed my attitude towards girls to not cling enough and not get into them.\n\nWith my 3rd crush the situation was preety much the same, distance ruined stuff.\n\nAnd with my last girlfriend things were the worse. We knew each other for a long time before, but we made out at new years, then went a little further, and boom, \"love\". I did have emotions for her at the beggining, but throughout the course of 9 months i couldnt really recognize her. Before it seemed she understood the way i am and behave, but then she changed her attitude completely and the same actions as before escalated from laughing to arguing constantly over how big of a dick i am, an asshole, etc, and honestly i know that was the case, i just thought she was similar or atleast understood that binding with me has bad sides too. Last few months of our relationship wr argued literally EVERY DAY, then came silent treatment from her, me displaying often the emotion i can display the best - anger, and occasionally having sex. I got bored super fast when spending time with her and thats just a thing i cant stand. We tried multiple times to fix it, but every time i tried to be happy around her, i was in denial, lying to myself all the time that this can work. Then i broke up with her.\n\nI really am starting to think that ill never find someone that understands what i am, how i behave, understands my problems and accepts them, knowing how to play me around so ill be the best version of myself that alone i cant get out. But i also know im super hard to be with, and all these things ive said before can be mentally draining and toxic, because no matter how hard i try, its either me being unhappy or the other side, or both. My emotion display problem also is a big red flag for others, especially when for a period of time i even had a problem with simply saying \"I love you.\". I hate myself for that, because i realized simply how fucking toxic i am no matter what i do.\n\nWhat should i do?

I know I may seem obsessive in our relationship of \"I won't force you if you aren't comfortable\" but that's because I've been forceful before and messed up harshly, so I want to make sure you're as comfortable with me as possible. \n\nJust know that for these past two years I've felt unwanted; nobody wanted to be my friend, or love me or even get to know me, because you know how shallow people are these days. But you've changed that. This morning I could not get out of bed. I couldn't find the drive. Today my bipolar has me in a really deep low. But, I thought of you. And although we're long distance for now, I still feel the warmth of you. And I looked at your pictures this morning. And you know what? I didn't just get up. I got up EARLY. That's the first time I've done that in YEARS. \n\nAnd I know we've not gotten to the \"I love you\" stage yet, but I don't mind that. As long as I have you. And the day I asked you if you wanted to be mine? And you said back to me \"if that's what you want, then that's what I want\" I knew this IS what I want.\n\nAnd everytime I remind you that you're beautiful or pretty or gorgeous (even though you don't believe it) I orry I say it too much. I apologize. But you come back with \"no, I like it! Keep on.\" And it makes me feel valid. Something I've not felt for a long time because of having to be tough to stay alive.\n\nBut I finally found my place to rest, in my adulthood. And not just rest, but I think I've found peace, with you.\n\nAnd I love hearing your laugh, don't don't get me started on that. Whenever I say \"OH! I almost forgot to tell you something. It's something super important.\" And then you ask what and I reply back with \"you're gorgeous \" and you give that laugh, and that thank you, but oh that laugh.\n\nAnd I wish you were more secure because you deserve to be but I understand you've had some pretty bad boyfriends. So it's only up to me to bring back your security. Maybe you'll start with mine too.\n\nEither way, K (for anonomousity), just know. I'm glad to have met you. I come out of my lows when I see you. And you don't understand how beautiful you are. But whenever I say \"I see you how you see me\" then that's how I understand.\n\nAnd I don't know but maybe this is jumping the gun.

I have a bigger vocabulary than he has so he'll ask if I use a word he doesn't know, and I'm better at English (not our first language) so he'll ask what words I use mean, or how to say things in English if talking to a non Swedish speaker. If he's unsure of how something works he'll admit it. It's such a huge sign of intelligence to ask instead of pretending you know, and it makes me feel more comfortable with not being \"perfect\".

Everything feels easy.\n\n- He never trash talks others unless they're being assholes on purpose. He usually has something kind to say about everyone we meet. \n\n- He's so...

Some people say it\u2019s good to have standards while others say, you\u2019re never going to find someone perfect. It\u2019s even harder when you have to consider if you fit into their vision of a perfect partner. \n\nWhat are your opinions on this?", "title": "Are my standards too high?"}, {"created_utc": 1617751816, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mlovuw/i_love_the_dance_of_love/", "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "selftext": "I love all the varieties of love.

My love for one person is not the same as it is for another.  I'm not going around sleeping with lots of people, but I constantly find something attractive and admirable in many different girls.  They are all unique.  We are all unique.  And it is so wonderful to share a space with someone, a space of mutual understanding, trust, growth and exploration.\n\nSometimes that space isn't as mutual as I thought it was, and sometimes it leads to rejection.  But that's the price you pay for love.  You have to go blind.  If you could go knowing \"this will definitely work out\", it wouldn't be love.  It'd be too cunning; too strategic.  Love is not cunning.\n\nThat just makes it all the more wonderful when it is shared.  And if it's not... I love the dance I am dancing with myself.

We accepted of course. Ive already met her a couple of times and she was a really nice person overall. Then she finally came into our house. During her quarantine, we talked a lot, and I mean hours upon hours, I dont think I was able to talk this freely to anyone Ive ever meet in my life. Other than the fact that she was super cute, she was the nicest and caring person I think this world has ever witnessed! More than even my family! In our conversations we had the same thoughts on everything, the same ideals, the same plans for the future and a various lot of different things in common. Eventually the 14 days finished, sooner than I was realized, she had to leave as she found a flat where to stay to and went away. From that day everytime I think about her I feel sad; knowing that there's someone out there this nice and good in the world, and the fact that i cant be part of this persons life and that I probably will never see her again makes my life a misery. \nWhat am I feeling when I think about her? Is it love? I cant understand because I think Ive already felt love for a girl once, but it wasnt anywhere close to the emotion Im feeling right now. This thing, this emotion I get when I think about her is more sweet, still sad nontheless. \nAnother thing that makes me confused is that I never thought about wanting to have sex with her, in my head I was never like \"Ah man this girl is so cute, Id love see how she is in bed\" and shit like that, everytime I think about her I just wish she would talk to me like she did when she was in quarantine with us. I just wish to hear her shy and cute little voice again, telling me about all the things she can imagine.\nSometimes I look at her profile picture on Whatsapp and see how an amazing and beautiful person she is, like the first day of spring still attached to the cold chilly winter, because I know Ill never get the chance to meet her again.\nIf you have made it this far please tell me, is this love that Im feeling?", "title": "Did I felt love for the first time?"}, {"created_utc": 1617725735, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mlfazi/ive_so_much_love_to_give/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just love Love so much you know.

Back then, me and uncle T had to share a cramped bicycle to get to work and ride around. One regular day at the construction site, we were sipping coffee and uncle T asked me: \"Hey, can you drove me to a place after work ? I'm hitting on a girl who live nearby, who is aunt N\". I couldn't care less because i had no interest in his love life, so i agreed anyway. After work, i took him to the place, it was a big house, i thought uncle T had hit a jackpot to manage date some girl from such rich family. The girl showed up at the front gate, uncle T took my bike, promised to come back at this specific hour and drove aunt N away. I intended to walk back to the site to chat with other colleagues, that's when i met her.\n\n She was a college student, i could tell because she was wearing a backpack and carrying books, i guess she just came home from school. She must be aunt N's little sister because they look alike. She opened the gate and walked in, i stood there and froze. That's when i knew that i need uncle T to hang out with auntie N as much as possible so i can see her again. Every week, uncle T would asked me to drive him to the place about 2 or 3 time, and i took every of those precious time just to have a glance at her again. But it was impossible because i never see her after that day. \n\nAuntie N and her parents, who is your grandparents, started to remember me and uncle T because we kept coming to their house often. They were fine with uncle T and aunt N dating even though he and i were just some poor workers at the time. I knew that i have a chance, but the bad thing is that it's so hard to see her. So one day, i decided that i need to get to their house as many time as possible without the reason is to be uncle T's driver. If her parents ask why i'm at their place, I would make up a reason is that uncle T is here and he asked me to picked him up at his given time, and their response would definitely be that uncle T was not here, and i would just go home. My goal was just to come to their house and see her, she never knew who i was anyway so i never thought of and also a little bit shy to ask them directly about her.\n\nMonths passed and our construction project finally finished, me and uncle T had to go back to our home in district 1. The site was at district 9 and we had to rent an apartment nearby until we finish the building. District 1 is 15 miles away from District 9, so it was both mentally and physically really difficult to get there with my old bicycle, but i never thought of giving up, so i basically rode my bike 15 miles almost everyday with a hope that i could have a glance at her one more time even if it's just for 1 second. Then thing happened. \n\nOne day, as usual i came to the house and asked the parents to tell uncle T that i'm here to pick him up. Grandma said: \" I know you aren't here to pick up T, T asked me to allow him to take N out tonight about a week ago. He's planned it for a week and there's no way that he hasn't told you about it. So tell me, who are you looking for?\". At that time i was shocked and froze, i didn't know what to do because i never thought any backup fake reason, the only solution right now is to tell the truth, so i did. I answered awkwardly: \"I'm here to see N's sister...\". Grandma looked at me so seriously, i thought she would kill me then, but then she just smiled and said:\" H isn't here, she's staying with her friends in a dorm in college X, she only come home on Saturday. Come back on Saturday and i'll introduce you to her\". After that day, i guess you have already figured out what happened next.

We had been together for almost two years before this. We both made mistakes, we both took each other for granted, we were constantly stressing one another out. So we decided to take a break. Not necessarily break up, but we both needed time away from each other to center ourselves and work on our own issues. \n\nSince then, we've slowly started spending time together again. At first, it was just going to the store together, or sitting down to chat for a bit. Then we started spending more time together. Watching shows, going on walks, sharing meals. All of this with the understanding that we were \"just friends\". I enjoyed spending time with her as friends. Being able to relax and not stress about anything; it was nice. \n\nToday was the most time we've spent together in a long time. We went to the store together to pick up a few things, then she drove me to a doctor's appointment. After that, we went to a local park with her volunteer group and did some cleanup work. Then we went and got takeout, and had a picnic on the floor of her dorm room. We both had a great time. \n\nIt was nice seeing her smile again. It was nice hearing her laugh again. It was nice being able to joke around and just talk. I think we both had a problem where we placed each other on pedestals, and that anything either of us did wrong somehow made us unworthy of the other's affection. But being able to joke and talk and laugh with each other comfortably again, it reminded me of why I fell for her in the first place.\n\nI adore her presence. Every minute with her is a gift. Even if we're not technically together right now, I value every moment we spend together. I was so worried about making a mistake or saying the wrong thing or making her not want to be with me. I was missing the forest for the trees; I was missing the wonderful woman I had right in front of me because I was so wrapped up in my own anxieties. \n\nI don't intend to make that same mistake again.

And I'm also scared that if Jack finds out aswell I'll lose him aswell but this feeling it's eating me alive and I dont know if I'm wrong or if nobody's wrong or what I should do \n\n\nAnd im sorry for the grammar errors", "title": "I think I like a girl my friend has been liking for 5 years"}, {"created_utc": 1617633149, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mkm25s/how_do_i_find_love/", "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "selftext": "I want a romantic partner in life, but I don't know where to look. can anyone give me suggestions, or where you found your partner", "title": "how do I find love"}, {"created_utc": 1617630719, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/mkl6vw/its_so_cute_when_people_talk_about_their_dreams/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "It just makes me really happy for them and want to protect them.

But nevertheless, I thought that he was cute enough, so I decided to message him, fully expecting that he wouldn\u2019t reply. Well, he did reply, and the conversations that ensued were completely unexpected. How could someone who\u2019s \u201cstraight\u201d be so willing to talk romantically with me?

He\u2019s a beautiful soul. He just almost doesn\u2019t feel real though. Has anyone ever felt this way about their SO?

Trigger warning) \n\nOk, first I need to give a bit of background. I've been struggling with depression for 6~7 years, tried to kms 2 times not bc I was sad, but bc everything was just so \"grey\", meaningless. I've never felt attracted to anyone in my life too, so no romantic experience\n\nShe is a girl from my class that entered my school 2 years ago (We are in the last year) and I've never tried to talk with her bc I always thought that it didn't mattered anyway, so why should I bother? But in the last month we saw each other at the city mental health clinic and she tried to talk with me. The conversation was totally led by her, but at the end I felt kinda different. I couldn't explain at the moment, so I just ignored it. We exchanged our numbers the next day bc of some school work so we could plan it, planning that forced us to talk about our hobbies and  plans and I realized we had the same interest, even though in the last years not even my hobbies could make me feel something good. Anyway, we've been talking since about almost everything and our problems turned into a topic somehow. She said that she tried to kill herself last year and, exactly when she said that, I felt like my heart was being \"grasped\"  and I couldn't think of anything rather that I didn't saw that she was struggling last year and that no one knew in my class besides our teachers. \n\nSince then, I've been writing a letter to her saying that even though she might not consider me her friend, she is really special to me and that she can count on me for everything. Nothing romantic, just a friendly letter. I sent to her and her response was... I don't  know, she just made my world turn colorful again. I've been crying happiness tears since then bc I've finally found a reason. I know she is a platonic asexual, but I don't need a relationship to be true, I just feel that, if she is happy, I am happy. And this is just so fucking good to feel. Feel that something matters to me. You know that kind of feelings that you only think are possible in movies? I am feeling that. Her smile is just gorgeous, her laughter is so warming and seeing her happy is enough to me.\n\nI've finally truly loved someone after all those years.

I\u2019ll explain some things that gives me hints that she might, but I\u2019m not sure if she just considers me a really good friend. I\u2019d really appreciate honest feedback, especially from girls.\n\nSo, to start off this girl I like is a coworker. We both work at a healthcare facility. We have the same schedule every week. During work we talk a lot and it always seems like she\u2019s constantly close by my side and gravitates towards me. We joke around and I feel some kind of flirty vibes between us. We tease each other and call each other names. Sometimes we touch each other playfully. Our co workers joked a couple times and said why don\u2019t you guys just date already And stuff along those lines. Her response is always just a laugh and never verbally says anything. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an awkward laugh or an embarrassed laugh. The thing about that is I question if she is just doing this to pass the time during work? Doing it just for fun? Being super friendly? Does she think of me as a just a really good friend she can feel comfortable with? A decent amount of time she talks about guys she\u2019s been talking to/did talk to and always complains to me about them.\n\nWe have only hungout once outside of work. She actually invited me to go bowling. We had a really good time together just me and her. We didn\u2019t kiss. But we hugged 2 or 3 times throughout the night and had lots of laughs.\n\nA few weeks later from bowling, I told her that I\u2019m going on vacation for the week to universal studios and she was interested in coming up for a day to spend time with me. She actually went as far as buying a yearly pass and dropped $400 at the drop of a dime and told me that I should do the same so we can go together often. Her planning ahead like that so far gets me thinking that she intends to stay close to me for an amount of time.\n\nWe don\u2019t talk through text everyday, but we talk about 3-4 times a week. Nothing crazy. I throw flirty emojis in there once in a while but I don\u2019t get them back.\n\nIn person, I try to be flirty with her and I\u2019m so attracted to her that I find myself staring at her and smiling at her with genuine interest. I guess it\u2019s so obvious that a patient at the facility out of no where when it was just me and her said \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just ask her to marry her already?\u201d I asked why do you say that with a smirk and she replied, \u201cI see the way you look at her and watch her\u201d. Later that day, the girl I like asked me about it and I was so caught off guard by the question and could feel my face getting red and eventually admitted I couldn\u2019t deny it was true. She was really smiley when she asked me and I could tell she was amused of how flustered I was at the question.

I keep hearing love is a choice. But isn\u2019t it a feeling? this person makes me happy, i can be myself, they are easy to talk to. they get me. With this person however, they barely were interested in sex with me or be intimate, yet they had done some pretty unloyal things ( not directly cheating physically or having sex).

Multiple times I thought of leaving them because they could  just be so unbelievably annoying and immature, we are going but i have a huge issue with how immature and childish they act- instead of treating me romantically like a partner.

We were in contact (text, fb messenger etc) up until couple of years ago, but its mostly once a year birthing wishing type of thing. \n\nWhat\u2019s actually freaking me out was that i\u2019ll keep having dreams about her from time to time. If i were to put a number to it, maybe about once  every six months. The dreams that i was having mostly about us being more romantically involved or something along that line. What\u2019s strange about it is that I hardly think about her anymore. But every time i\u2019m having these dreams, the feeling would linger for quite sometime. When these happens, it felt like im crushing on her all over again.\n\nI don\u2019t even know where she is or what she\u2019s doing right now.

The first time we met I was eating in the restaurant, the chefs serve the food and she served one of my courses, I was spellbound, her eyes captivated me and her... Aura made me feel warm and fuzzy. I feel like there was an instant little spark, never quite confirmed this for reasons I will explain.\n\nFast forward about a month and through my current position in another restaurant I was fortunate enough to hear of a vacancy, had I not already been bewitched I would have applied anyway as the restaurant was well regarded as one of the best in my country. The fact I could see her more often was another feather in the cap. The fact that my boss would be her father was another matter! I am 31 and she is 22, I have never had a relationship with a younger woman, they have always been older. \n\nI got the job and started work, we were at a very high level so my focus was on the job and not so much the gal, she would come, as far as I was concerned, when the time was right. \n\nA few months went by, needless to say we developed a great working relationship, frought with a little tension here and there. All was professional. I had suspicions that she was having an under the radar relationship with another chef. \n\nThis was confirmed when the Christmas party came around. Normally I would get a little jealous of another bloke, but I could see he was a bit of a waster and a player and was fairly surprised at how little he bothered me. About 6 more months go by, and whilst she is on holiday with her family, her 'fella' turns up to work makes a few excuses for why he can't continue to work in the restaurant and ups and leaves. \n\nShe returns from her holiday and is understandably upset as she didn't see him for what he was until this point. A few more months go by until we start flirting. Although to a certain extent we always behaved differently around each other, used to catch each others gaze across the restaurant (open kitchen) and used to have some pretty in depth conversations. I was always cautious as Daddy has a bit of a temper and is very protective of his daughter. But whenever he and the rest if the family were not in the restaurant our flirting would increase much to the chagrin of the other employees, 'get a room' 'dyou guys want some space' etc\n\nI consider myself to be quite an old school gentleman, but I've been burned in the past and hesitate nowadays when it comes to biting the bullet. What I did was mention a restaurant I was thinking of booking about an hour and a half away from where we worked. A very good restaurant that I really wanted to visit, and she excitedly said she would love to go as well and pulled up the website. Now this restaurant only takes fully paid pre bookings and she then proceed to pay for the entire meal and wine pairing for a few weeks down the line. Bingo! Not an official date but a 3 - 5 hour dinner with plenty of time and the right atmosphere to bite the aforementioned bullet, and a few courses of world class food!\n\nA few days later I said that whilst it'd be great to grab a train we wouldn't get back, so I said how about we make a day and night of it, I can drive us there in the morning, we'll wander about the town for the day, have dinner in the evening and book somewhere to stay in the evening. She was more than happy with this.\n\nOne week before the 'date' her father (my boss) and I had a falling out regarding prearranged annual leave I had informally booked with his wife. I ended up walking out of the restaurant. And neither her or her father spoke to me again. Although I made just as little effort to reach out. \n\nA year and a half later. Mid covid pandemic, I get contact from one of the members of staff who was also in the family. Next thing I know I'm being offered a job in his new restaurant working once again alongside the love of my life.  Lockdown has postponed reopening of the restaurant but I'll hold a few weeks to see if the dynamic has shifted, if not, then I plan to book the same restaurant and surprise her. And hopefully she feels the same way and it will be the greatest love story ever told! Also hopefully her father doesn't castrate me, I don't think I'd enjoy that. \n\nHappy reading, apologies for any typo's, bad grammar and if any part was hard to understand.

I wasn\u2019t able to go because I couldn\u2019t take off work on such short notice and no one could cover my shift, but I stayed with her last night as it was the last night we\u2019d get to be together for two nights as they were leaving early this morning and won\u2019t be returning back until Saturday afternoon.\n\nThis next part needs context, so to sum it up I\u2019ve been in a really bad depression spell for the last, well, basically the whole winter season. Over January I had some med changes as the ones I was on weren\u2019t working properly and it\u2019s been a headache trying to get it adjusted to a place I\u2019d feel comfortable with. My girlfriend knows this and while we\u2019ve struggled with both of our journeys together, she\u2019s always remained supportive and overall just wants me to feel better. The current medication I\u2019m on I started about two months ago as an \u201cas needed\u201d type thing but my doctor recently added it to my daily medications and I\u2019ve been taking it as prescribed for about two weeks.\n\nWell last night before we went to bed and we were both taking our medicine, I couldn\u2019t find mine in my backpack. Frustrated, I dug through it and couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. My girlfriend asked what was wrong and I told her I couldn\u2019t find it, and immediately, without hesitation, she asks, \u201cdo you need me to take you home to go get it?\u201d\n\nNow, this was 9:30 at night, she had to be awake at the ass crack of dawn for the road trip, and I live about 5 minutes away from her so it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal, but after she said it I had one of those \u201coh my god, I love you\u201d moments. I ended up finding it on her TV stand right after she said it, and I just kind of paused and said \u201cYou were really about to take me home to go get it.\u201d almost in disbelief, not that it\u2019s unlike her to do something like that, but because it felt like a way of saying \u201cI love you\u201d without even actually saying it.\n\nI ended up hugging her for about five minutes straight because I was just so awestruck that she would offer to take me home just to get my medication because she knows how important it is for me right now to stay on top of it. She knows how terrible I\u2019ve been feeling and she knows how much I\u2019ve struggled with trying to find the right medication. I would\u2019ve been fine if I wasn\u2019t able to take it for one day, but it\u2019s really important for me right now as I\u2019m still adjusting to it and I\u2019ve been trying to get my moods stabilized. We haven\u2019t always seen eye to eye on these things and we are slowly learning to be open and talk about it, and just the fact that she *offered*, even though she had to get up early in the morning, even though she has so much going on right now, she still *offered* to take me home just so I could make sure I took it before we went to bed.\n\nIt was definitely one of those \u201coh my god, I love you so much\u201d moments that really spoke to me and made me feel so loved and so taken care of.  We\u2019ve been together for a year and a half (2 years in June!) and I love her so much, and hearing her say that just made me love her so much more, if it was even possible.\n\nI just wanted to share that because I really am the luckiest guy in the world and it\u2019s the little things like that that make me feel so loved and so lucky to have someone who would be willing to do something like that, as small as it is, just to make sure I can do what I need to do. I couldn\u2019t stop smiling when I was hugging her and it gave me a feeling that I haven\u2019t felt in quite some time.\n\nFind you someone who\u2019s willing to go the extra mile to make sure your needs are met. Find you someone who loves you enough to even consider taking you home to get your medication even if it\u2019s late and they have to get up early.\n\nI\u2019m so, so incredibly lucky and so thankful for her. I really hit the jackpot with this girl. It\u2019s the little things that matter, folks.

It's always amazing to me that we only started talking about 3 months ago - I know that time means little in terms of how you feel about someone but it always amazes me how much she means to me and impacts my life. In the relatively short span of time I've known her she's done alot more for me than people I've known for years - she's always willing to show she cares, sne listens to me when I'm sad, she supports me in everything I do. I talk to her everyday and she completes me honestly. She's charming and sweet, smart and witty, she's also super scary. I'm a bit hard to tame but I'll always behave around her. I like who I'm becoming with her in my life. \nShe's also so funny, you'd be laughing all the time if you let her talk freely. Even on her bad days (because we all have those) I still think she's definitely one of the best parts of the world. She tries so hard for the people in her life and she's so strong. I'm so proud of how far she's come in her life and I'm so excited about the things she can do. \nShe's pretty much my best friend and definitely the most beautiful person in my life. I love her so much. Would do anything for her. And no, we're not in a relationship together but she's really one of the best and my most favourite people ever.

The thing is, initially I took that as a no, so i kept pressing her to say no multiple times, telling her that I wouldn\u2019t be mad at all if she rejected me and that I like honesty...she refused to say no, and said that she will see if we can find a day to hang out during vacation (which is 2 weeks away) but said that maybe we can bring her best friend along to the date. Again, I was being honest, I told her that I don\u2019t want her to bring her friend, which was maybe a bad move on my part because she probably wanted to feel safe and comfortable and I didn\u2019t allow her to get. At the end she said \u201cok i\u2019ll see and then i\u2019ll tell you\u201d. \n\nUsually those responses mean no, but why would she refuse to reject me when she had the chance?

(also, sorry if there is some grammar issues, I do speak English, but I'm not 100% fluent) \n\nSo, to give some context, I'm currently on a vacation trip with my family on Medell\u00edn, which is actually one of the most important tourist destinations in Colombia for both Colombians (as me and my family) and foreigners.\n\nAlso, there is a metro station called \"Acevedo\", which is currently being upgraded, so part of it is unaccessible to the metro users (this is going to be quite important later on this story)\n\nNow, that we have some context and important info... The story goes quite like this:\n\n\nMe and my family (Mother and sister) woke up a bit late since we've been walking around all day for the previous two days.\n\nOur plans were quite simple, get on the metro and then go to Explora Park (one of the many places that you must visit if go to Medell\u00edn). But as soon as we got to the metro station our plans changed, we decided to see the aerial lift and get a ride on it as we never had a chance to get a trip on them before, so we headed to Acevedo Station which is the one that connects with one of the aerial lift lines. So basically, we took the train to Acevedo right away. \n\nAs we were arriving (bout two or three stations to reach Acevedo), this girl comes and ask us about the way to get into Acevedo station (due to upgrading processes as mentioned before), so we explained her how to get off the train and getting into Acevedo station without having an issue or something like that. \n\nTbh the first time she spoke with us, I didn't paid too much attention to her, as I was listening to music and checking my phone, but I was able to notice her accent, and noticed that she was an American teenager speaking Spanish almost perfectly. \n\nSo... After they, we get off the train and head towards the aerial lift line, surprisingly, she and her companion (which I guess was her grandma or something like that) were behind us, once again I didn't noticed her due to my cellphone and music, but things turned all the way around when we got in the aerial lift \"wagon\". It was a bit small, so there wasn't much space, I just sit in one corner with my sister right beside me. I finished sending a text and got my head up to check who was also getting inside the wagon, and there she was... \n\nI got immediately shocked with her appearance, black and long her curls on her hair (just with the style that I do prefer the most), followed by a really white skin, some piercings (thing that makes me crazy tbh) and some brown-is eyes. \n\nSo... Here I am in a quite confinated space that was about 2 x 2 meters (bout 6.5 ft or so, might be bigger tbh) with this beautiful American girl who speaked Spanish fluently AF and was speaking with the other passengers (including my mother and sister), and me being the shy and derpy being that I'm, just got back to my cellphone and music, trying to avoid eye contact with her and her stunning foreigner beauty(?).\n\nAfter a while, she talked directly to me, and I did notice that she was, so I removed one of my earplugs and ask her to repeat, as I wasn't able to hear what she just said. She asked me if I did knew how to play an instrument (as I was following the song with my hands and feet) I replied that I did, and she told me that she also did, she played bass and likes to play rock music.\n\nIdrk what happened but at that very moment I felt something really strange inside me, like if something clicked within my whole body and knew that this girl was someone really awesome with similar likings as me (rock and Star Wars checked as she had a Star Wars themed purse with her) and had the style that I just love to see.\n\nAs we were arriving to the last station, which leads to another aerial lift line, which also leads to Arvi Park (another touristic location), she asks us If we're going to Arvi park, I instantly looked at my mother and sister and asked them if they wanted to go, they said yes (victory for me... Or so I thought) and replied to this girl that we were going, changing the Explora park plan that we had in mind originally.\n\nWe got out of the wagon and was already heading to the next line with this girl and her grandma leading our way, when suddenly my mom calls me from behind and tells me to get back into the wagon... She and my sister changed her mind and told me that we were heading back to the Explora park as we already saw the aerial lift ride, I argued with her a bit, not noticing that the girl and her grandma were already way ahead of us.\n\nSo... By the time I was going to turn around and tell this girl that there was a change of plans, she was not the, I tried to search for her in the semi crowded station, unfortunately, the only thing I was able to see was her looking around for us, just as I was, but it was too late, the crowd and the line she was formed up, were already pushing her into the wagon for the next station... \n\n\nAt this moment I got a bit sad and a bit angry at my mother and sister since they both had said that we were going to Arvi Park to hike for some time.\n\nSo yeh... That's how I basically fell in love at first sight with someone and got fucked every chance to even say goodbye to her due to my mother and sister.\n\nThe only things that I know about her, is that she is a bassist and lives somewhere around Minneapolis.\n\nSo yeh... I'm closing this post with the following request.\n\nGuys, let's try to make this post explode so that maybe, she can somehow read this post so she can know that the Colombian guy she met on Metro Cable, sends his regards and is sorry for not saying goodbye.\n\nAlso, if you happen to know a girl with curly black hair, with piercings, brown-ish eyes, that knows how to play bass and lives somewhere nearby Minneapolis, try to show this to her, maybe she is the one featured on this history.\n\nAnd that's all guys, thanks for your attention and patience while reading this post, peace and love for ya'll.", "title": "How I fell in love at first sight and lost any opportunity due to my family."}, {"created_utc": 1579239340, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/epw49r/little_thinks_for_love/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "\u0412\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439, \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0438. \u041d\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0430 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0434\u044f\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0430. \u041d\u0435 \u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0439!", "title": "Little thinks for love"}, {"created_utc": 1579235797, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/epvhhf/why_havent_i_found_it_yet/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "Every so often I get this feeling like i\u2019m on the Truman Show and love doesn\u2019t actually exist and everyone is just pretending it does.", "title": "Why Haven\u2019t I Found It Yet?"}, {"created_utc": 1579235490, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/epvff5/help_a_girl_out/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I'm a teen and I have never had a boyfriend, I kinda want to but I'm just really scared of vulnerability.

Please dont think im going through your stuff, i'm really not. I was just kinda chillin on the computer and little ian bear doesn\u2019t know how to log off on things so i just kinda\u2026 saw this and decided to write more, however, i am quite sure you will never actually see this. Which is totally fine. I don't know if i write it more for your sake or my own actually. I like just sitting down and expressing my love for you. You\u2019ve been my little secret for so long sometimes all i can do is talk to computers, or just write about you. I can't tell you how much i actually love you, you\u2019d think i was crazy. You know\u2026 that\u2019s okay. It's okay to think i'm crazy. I think i'm crazy too. Sometimes you can be a tad crazy too. Lets be crazy together &lt;3 no i'm kidding that sounds so psychotic. I just love you. A lot. You know how people have something that always pushes them to do something? Get through school, or work, or therapy? Whether that something that pushes someone is actually a someone, or a drive or their future? You know what mine is? Having the opportunity to come home and tell you of all of my accomplishments. I love you so much. You have no idea how much i love you, how much id sacrifice for you, for us, for our love. We have such a crazy story of how we become us, how we are what we are and what we are going to do to become something even greater. We take countless risks, but we take them anyways because we love each other and sometimes the thrilling risk is worth it. Love does crazy things to people sometimes Ian\u2026 now i'm just blabbering. I'm sorry.\u00a0\n\nNow that i am quite certain and positive you will not ever actually read this\u2026\u00a0\n\nI've been in love with you for probably six months now? I've always saw you, looked at you, and talked about you the same way for six months. There's something about you, that is so enchanting and pure and i want it to be apart of my life forever and i've wanted it for six months. And its like\u2026 all of the things that has happened between us? Makes us sacred and real and pure because we are still here. Fighting the same fight and traveling the same journey together and i feel like it's going to be a long one. Perhaps not forever. Maybe you will find someone else, hook interest in someone else, which is fine, but i'd like to thank you for being the beginning of my forever. For giving me the romance i've craved and cherished since i was a little girl obsessed with romantic forbidden love stories and you have given me exactly that, and i think our story beats the hundreds i've read. We have the best story. I want to write a book one day about us, because our story is one to live for. I've actually typed you out a small little novel here on accident and i apologize\u2026 that is, if you ever do actually read this, but i'm sure you won\u2019t though.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Everything about you, screams perfection to me. Perfect drifts out from your pores and seeps right into my heart.\n\nYou make me so happy Ian i love you so so so so soooooooo much\u2026 my baby. I Love you.

Then they were asked about how they felt using questions to measure their levels of empathy.\n\nThe team hypothesised that the vulnerability of the victims \u2014 determined by age, rather than species \u2014 would be the most important factor in participants' levels of distress and concern. In fact, empathy levels for the puppy, older dog, and baby human were on similar levels, while the adult person came last. The adult dog only received lower scores of empathy when compared to the infant human victim.\n\n\"Subjects did not view their dogs as animals, but rather as 'fur babies,' or family members alongside human children,\" the researchers concluded, showing how people often think of their pets as part of the family.\n\nLast month, a study published in the journal Scientific Reports found one reason we're so attached to our dogs. According to the team, dogs make more facial movements when a human is paying attention to them.\n\nThe researchers used a video camera to record the facial movements of 24 dogs when there was either a human facing the animal, or facing away, with or without a treat.\n\nIt was previously thought that animal facial expressions were purely unconscious, but the study found that dogs raise their eyebrows and even make their eyes bigger when they are looking for attention from a person.\n\nThe presence of\u00a0treats had no impact on the expressions the dogs made, suggesting it wasn't about them turning on the charm to get extra snacks.\n\nInstead, the researchers concluded it could be a route of communication between owner and pet.\n\n\"\\[The research\\] tells us that their facial expressions are probably responsive to humans \u2014 not just to other dogs,\" Bridget Waller, professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Portsmouth, and author of the study, told The Guardian.\n\n\"\\[That\\] tells us something about how domestication has shaped \\[dogs\\], and that it has changed them in order to be more communicative with humans, in a sense.\"\n\nThank You Keep Smile.", "title": "People really do love dogs more than other humans, according to a new study"}, {"created_utc": 1579168408, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ephan6/i_asked_her_still_you_love_me/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I asked her \" still you love me\".."}, {"created_utc": 1579167779, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/eph7hi/an_appropriate_appreciation_on_love/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "Idk how to start this one off honestly.\n\nI guess if I could explain it in the best way possible, I\u2019d describe love as music.\nYou were hit off guard by what you thought was gonna be something you\u2019ve already heard actually makes you listen closer. \nWhy is it that the song always ends with a serious and sudden, \u201cgive me more of that\u201d effect, and you either can or cannot find anymore of it.\nAnd as interesting as it may seem, what you thought the person who created the song to have meant in the lyrics or instrumental even was just a ploy to get you a little more hooked for the actually drop of knowledge to come next. \n\n\nRecently in my love life I met someone from an app. Honestly I didn\u2019t know what I was looking for, but I knew I\u2019d find out throughout the relationship.

He smoked pot all the time, was a manager at an ice cream shop in the mall, was addicted to porn and partied every single night while living with 6 dudes in a huge party house. I believed him to be dreamy as hell. He slightly played the drums. But not good enough to actually get in a band. Or really play drums. He\u2019s a bartender and has been one now for 16 years. Is still single. \n\nSecond boyfriend: An emotionally unavailable dude with a temper who was my boss at the hat store I worked at in the mall when I was 21. He was 29. And a manager at a hat store dating 21 year old girls. It didn\u2019t last very long. He ended up cheating on every girl I heard about and probably me as well. \n\nThird boyfriend: Together for a year. We moved in together after a month. He was a singer/musician. Actually VERY talented and VERY hot. Smart, witty, the funniest person I know. An amazing writer and performer. We dated when I was 23 and he was almost 30. He worked as a manager at a movie theater. Was addicted to porn and we couldn\u2019t really have good sex. He obsessed over exes. Cried more than I did. One day he\u2019d say we were soul mates the next he\u2019d say he wanted time apart from me. He eventually had a mental break after I broke up with him and became a stoner, a shroom addict, walked away from the home he bought and left all his stuff (and roommates) went by a different name and shaved his head. He\u2019s doing ok now. I think.  He\u2019s pansexual apparently so good for him. Explains a lot. We became good friends and I adore him but I never REALLY know what\u2019s going on inside his mind even though we both declared one another the boy and girl version of each other. \n\nMy ex fianc\u00e9- Hot mess. Together for 4 years. Also moved in together after only two months. Emotionally hot and cold all the time. An amazing musician but was in school to be a doctor. So he had his shit together and then also really really didn\u2019t. His temper was off the charts. He was the kindest warmest person until he was the coldest most distant person. We fought all the time because basically he stopped loving me but wouldn\u2019t let me go. He wants love but has no idea how to accept it or show it fully. He\u2019s married now and looks miserable AF. Probably the most normal of the bunch but I did not feel loved. I felt neglected. \n\nMy latest ex: Together a year and a half. He was the worst of all.  Discovered he has narcissist personality disorder and he was emotionally, mentally, verbally, sexually and a few times physically abusive. Our relationship was toxic even though I took everything I learned over the years and applied it here, and in my opinion was the best GF I could have ever been he was too abusive and toxic for it to work but I still gave him a hear and a half of my time anyway! Way overly emotional and showed it horribly. Clingy and controlling. Nuff said on that dumpster fire.\n\nNow I have huge crushes on: One- an emotionally unavailable guy who\u2019s married to his job of giving to the community and is extremely normal and kind and funny and sarcastic and very into me but doesn\u2019t seem to like children or have time for love. \n\nTwo- A dude three years younger who\u2019s bisexual and only starting his entire PHD program who is emotionally aloof yet romantic and extremely talented and too smart for his own good. Emotionally troubled. \n\nThree- A guy I worked with for a bit who i was immediately attracted to and I am almost positive is a sex addict and he takes nudes of the girls he sleeps with and sends them to people and is 43 and single and NOT dating because he doesn\u2019t want to \u201cwaste his time\u201d he is sarcastic, dry, witty, smart, we have amazing conversation\n\nFinalist and worst of all!- A recovering drug addict who is still technically married and has NOW two children! Co parents well with his ex. TOO emotionally clingy. Sensitive as hell, a romantic and tortured soul. He cheated on his ex (but still wife) the entire time they were together apparently. He was a musician around the world in three bands. And took advantage of that. Talented, smart, funny as hell and immature AF but super fun and adorable. Oh and went to prison recently for being caught with drugs where he went to rehab and fell in love with a married woman who he proceeded to have an affair with. \n\nI choose winners dont i?? \n\nDon\u2019t worry I\u2019m not going to get into a relationship with any of them. But I flirt relentlessly with all of them (my crushes)\n\nWhat they have in common? Either being TOO emotional and nuts and clingy and insecure or being far too aloof, too emotionally detached and giving almost zero effs. All quite funny, sarcastic, artsy, kind (deep down) sexual (but may have weird issues there somehow) communicative, interesting, eccentric, quirky and also me. They have me in common which I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good or bad at this point. \n\n\n\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f thanks for reading \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if you even did.", "title": "I always want the wrong dudes"}, {"created_utc": 1579167242, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/eph4mq/2_months_of_distance_relationship_is_paid_off/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "First post here lol.

So long, in fact, I can't remember when we first met. But I do remember the first time I realized I was in love with you. All you were doing was just being your usual, dumb self, and I couldn't help but feel good. We had each other in this incredibly large world, with an incredible amount of time to do anything. Of course, good times never last forever. We argued and argued, and that left both of us hurt. You convinced me that nobody else liked me, that they just put up with me, and made a performance just to convince me to shove off, much like the performances I create in order to show everyone it's fine. But it wasn't fine. I wasn't fine. \n\n        Besides you, I had essentially no one else. The last time I was invited to a party was years ago, and the last time I had a birthday party... I don't think there was a time. You had me convinced I wasn't loved, and I felt like *you* didn't love me either. \n\n\nI fell. \n\n\n        I tried as hard as I could to call for help, for someone to get me out of the prison I created, without tipping you off. \n      \n        No one wanted to help.\n\n        I was jealous of everyone else and how they had someone, how they led happier, more successful relationships than mine. And you knew of my jealousy, my envy. I had someone who I had nothing with, and it was all my fault. Had you bullied me? Yes. But I couldn't hate you, not for telling the 'truth'. \n\n        I fantasized of dating different people, just to get the feeling of love, even if it was just for a moment. By god, I missed it, it was so addicting to just box myself in and feel loved by something imaginary, but I knew it was because you failed to love me. You found out, and you pushed me farther in. How could I think such things? I'm such a bad person, failing you, failing everyone else.\n\n        I was helpless, I had nothing else to turn to, I wanted to die. I was useless, unchanging, lazy, unlovable. You pushed me, almost like there was nothing else in life more important than this, almost like this was the goal. On over 6 different occasions, I tried to end my life, and on each attempt, you were there, the primary force, egging me on like a house on Halloween. After I failed each attempt, I was at my lowest, because you somehow found a way to sink me even lower. But after the sixth attempt, something happened. Even now, I don't know what changed, perhaps it was someone else who told me the right thing, or the last time you tried to bring me down I was simply tired of it, but I was done with you. I would no longer have to listen to so much hatred, jealousy, and manipulation. \n\n        But now it's the present day, and I still realize that I should not and will not deal with your toxicity, but I can't live without you. It's simply impossible. You go everywhere I go, and do everything I do. If I ignored you for the rest of my life with my ears blocked so as to not hear your complaining, I wouldn't get to hear the beautiful sounds life has to offer. With my eyes closed so as to not see you, I wouldn't get to experience this incredibly large world. And if I ended my life so as to never see you again, I wouldn't get to have such an incredible amount of time to do anything. \n\nYou are a part of me.\n\n*You are me.* \n\nI look around and realize I have no one else for me but me.

We don\u2019t work directly together but we work for the same company and our positions support one another.\n\nWe met earlier this year at a work function because I asked for his support on getting me to the next step (his position). He is not my superior, but his position is considered higher than mine.\n\nWe hit it off immediately and I asked for his number.\n\nWe have talked nearly every day since February of this year. He is very encouraging and incredibly smart. He is the leader in his position for the prominent company that we work for. \n\nI\u2019m a very headstrong woman who doesn\u2019t take shit from anyone and also happens to be a leader in my area, and I have to have a thick skin due to the work that I\u2019m involved in. It took me a long time to get back to my former bad-assery, and I make shit happen. Years ago, I dumped my ex who was physically and emotionally abusive. He stole my identity and racked up credit cards in my name totaling about 15k (yes, I pressed charges, but the court system takes a long time).\n\nThis is the first guy I have actually liked in a long time. I purposely distanced myself from people after being emotionally and physically abused because I didn\u2019t trust anyone, not even myself. So I have never put myself back out there. After lots of therapy, I\u2019m not perfect, but I\u2019m back to my former glory. \n\nThis guy isn\u2019t usually my type-he\u2019s shorter than me, and my type is unfortunately douchebag (I usually like tall muscular guys, but I\u2019ve been avoiding that due to past trauma). He\u2019s so incredibly driven and smart, and isn\u2019t intimidated by me. I\u2019m purposely intimidating to men because I\u2019m an expert in my field that\u2019s male dominated. (Men come to me on a regular basis for information on coatings, application, etc). He has a son, and I don\u2019t really consider it a deal breaker. I\u2019ve never dated someone who has a child, but I can tell he adores him. His confidence is through the roof, and it\u2019s so incredibly attractive. He gets shit done, same as I do, and respects that we each have our own shit to do. We respectively make time for each other to talk nearly every day, and he always gives me his undivided attention. He was raised in the south, so he\u2019s absolutely the definition of a southern gentleman. I even had such a terrible day last week that I was crying my eyes out to him on the phone and he listened the entire time. I don\u2019t regularly show emotion because of my fear of people. But he seems to like me as I am, he challenges me to be better, calls me out on my bullshit, and encourages me to keep going because I\u2019m just as good and better as the men in my field.\n\nLong story short, this guy is about to take a promotion in another state. He goes out of his way to call me every day, supports my bad-assery, has no problem with my height, and loves that I have all of my own shit. I have my own house, car, and pay for all of my bills. He has his own house and car, and we actually happen to live relatively close to each other now (same city, we haven\u2019t been to each other\u2019s places). \n\nThis is going to sound so elementary, but should I tell him I like him before he leaves?  He offered me his position (I\u2019m sort of next in line for it) but I told him I don\u2019t want it because I would be settling. But the fact that the man is willing to give me his position is HUGE. I don\u2019t expect him to hold up his life for me, because I would never expect someone to do that, nor would I ever ask.

This isn\u2019t going to be a beginning, middle, and end type of thing, I\u2019m literally going to explain everything and all the crazy \u201cforbidden\u201d emotions I\u2019ve been able to feel for the first time. \n\nSo clearly our age difference is illegal but we\u2019re not together (yet \ud83d\ude09) and are essentially in a dynamic where we are friends who know we like each other which is a kind of fun stage in a relationship to be in, I think haha. But it gets more complicated than that, which I\u2019ll get into.\nBecause I\u2019m almost 18 (legal), it\u2019s kind of like we are \u201cwaiting\u201d to be able to be open about our feelings, which just extends this flirting with no commitment stage even longer, which strengthens this whole secretive and forbidden feeling!\n\nSo before I met him, I had only ever talked to guys my own age so it\u2019s not like I was seeking out an \u201colder guy\u201d or anything like this. Sam and I actually met on Tinder which neither of us like to talk about, considering the slightly illegal circumstances that comes with that story\ud83d\ude02. Obviously you have to be 18 for Tinder so I, being bored during quarantine, thought to myself \u201chey why don\u2019t I make an account and say that I\u2019m 18 on it - I\u2019m almost 18 anyway so it\u2019s perfectly fine\u201d.  I completely didn\u2019t take into account the fact that the difference between 17 and 18 is the difference between illegal and legal. \ud83e\udd2d\n\nAnyways, my account said I was 18, and on May 1st, I got a message from a really handsome technician named Sam! The very first thing I noticed before even looking at his profile was how polite and formal he seemed when he typed - like his grammar was perfect and  I also felt this feeling of newness and something different as I\u2019d never experienced someone communicating with me in such a respectful way except for teachers! \ud83d\ude02 \n\nIt was kind of a weird yet alluring feeling and I kept chatting to him on tinder and later on snapchat. I found out his age was 25 but I completely didn\u2019t think twice about it as he was so engaging to talk to - if anything for girls my age I think it feels kind of thrilling speaking to an older guy. If he was a 50 year old man, it would be completely different, for me anyway, as I\u2019d find that age gap to be so big to the point where it would feel weird and clearly wrong. I would feel as though I\u2019m different and missing out on dating people my age and generational differences would also be present. I\u2019d feel more embarrassed than proud. But Sam\u2019s age of 25 seemed perfect, especially when I eventually got to hear him speaking (which i\u2019ll explain how in a second) and realised he was someone I found genuinely cool and exciting and not someone who would be so old that they\u2019d drag me down with their old age. Also, the fact that he was born in 1995 and I was born in 2002, doesn\u2019t even sound too extreme.\nAnyway, I automatically put him on a metaphorical pedestal, thinking \u201che\u2019s older and more mature than all guys my age\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\u201d.  \n\nThe second trait that immediately struck me was the complete straightforwardness that he had. He found me attractive on my profile pictures and told me \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful in your pictures, I\u2019m surprised I haven\u2019t seen you around\u201d (considering we live on a small island where a lot of people know each other, at least by face). I find this directness and the way he seemed able to say exactly what he thought right from the start, to be such a masculine trait. It was definitely a part of his personality to be respectful to ladies in a way of just wanting to be kind rather than disrespectful, but I also think this straightforward trait develops with age. Some boys my age probably act respectful as well but in the small island I live in, there\u2019s a huge hook up culture and boys usually an ulterior sexual motive. No boy has caught my attention in a meaningful way like Sam did. Teenage boys may naturally have more pressure to not appear desperate or like a \u201csimp\u201d so I sort of started to feel  lucky to be able to receive this \u201cspecial\u201d treatment from a developed and mature man. \ud83e\udd2b\n\nSo anyway, we continued chatting online for a while and I had completely forgotten that he thought I was 18, as I still stupidly thought it really didn\u2019t matter. THEN one day he randomly asked me \u201cSo you\u2019re 18 right?\u201d That\u2019s when it all clicked to me and I realised I would seek like such a disrespectful girl that didn\u2019t care about his reputation and I freaked out assuming he would immediately block me once I told him I was 17. I really thought that would be the end of it and he\u2019d had such an affect on me I was actually crying during this conversation. I was soooo upset and worried, but of course, I knew I had to be honest so I told him I was 17 and luckily Sam reacted in a clearly very shocked yet calm way.  He told me he\u2019s not the type of guy to hit on underage girls and despite being a careful person, I completely believed him (probably some naivety there but he didn\u2019t let me down). He also told me that he was really glad he asked my age which made me feel like some rebellious kid, who had misbehaved or something and it felt so weird knowing he had been so openly attracted to me before, and now he suddenly wasn\u2019t \u201callowed\u201d. \nI apologised so much to him and luckily he told me not to worry and that he\u2019ll still be cool with me.\n\n I kind of wondered why he didn\u2019t just instantly block me and started to think maybe all he wanted was a hook up and that because I was almost 18, he only wanted to keep me added because he was willing to \u201cwait\u201d for me to become legal or something.  I was really questioning his intentions and wondering how many other girls he may have done this will the. This actually at the time seemed like the only probable reason to me as most guys I have spoken to had this ulterior motive of sex or sexually related reasons. \nI\u2019m SO glad I let this thought go though (not that I really chose to \u201c, if I\u2019m honest, because I was so intrigued my him that I was probably never going to leave\ud83d\ude02).  I now know Sam as a person enough, and he has opened up to me about his thoughts and experiences with hook ups. He openly has told me that he regrets the whole stage of his life where he used to hook up with girls from clubs often, and he had become out of control which he explained was against his morals and was he i still trying to completely stop. I knew for sure that if he wanted to hook up with someone he would go to a club that very night and easily do it in that impulsive way. The fact that he was so open about that was almost reassuring to me. \nI knew it was against his morals and something that he wanted to stop as he always talks about how the next person he sleeps with, he wants to be his wife and how deep down he feels ready to settle down - despite his impulsiveness which is the main weakness I noticed about him. \n\nAnyway, his response to finding out my age was so attractive to me as it showed that this age barrier thing was clearly new to him too, and I was glad to know he wasn\u2019t a man who specifically seeked out much younger girls.\n I noticed that after I told him my age, he started chatting to me in an even more formal, \u201cteacher-like\u201d way than he already did naturally - by calling me youngster nicknames like a \u201csmarticle particle\u201d and saying I\u2019m mature for my age. He was really making me feel like a 5 year old or something but honestly it was a kind of good feeling as I kind of felt like he was looking out for me and I looked up to him. \nPartly his formal behaviour with me felt like a loss, as I missed the compliments and more level playing field interactions that I thought might lead to something, but I also became even more attracted to him because of how sensible he was acting in the situation. \n\nHe soon introduced me to a website which he live-streams on for fun with some online friends, from the US. It felt amazing getting to observe him speaking to other people and everything and really got to understand him as a person. I instantly noticed he had this unique and perfect contrast between giving off such a fun and child-like nature with the funniest laugh i\u2019ve ever heard in my life, while also being able to be that extremely intelligent and serious person than he is, in certain conversations. \nThis part of our experience, where I really got to observe his character from an outside perspective, really made me realise how much he was NOT the \u201cpedophile\u201d type of person and he would not be proud to admit to anyone that he was talking to a girl as young as me. \ud83d\ude05 But this made it more thrilling for me as I knew he was somewhat sacrificing his morals to maintain the connection him and I had and it felt like we shared this intimate and slightly dangerous secret! \nAs time went on I realised I was completely infatuated with him and I started obsessively watching all of his live-streams every day. I completely forgot that he even lived so nearby to me and he actually began to feel like a superior celebrity, to me that I was fan-girling over, especially as he had begun to message me very rarely at this point. \nHe\u2019d only to check up on me and ask how I\u2019d been that week, and small talk stuff. It really felt like he had forgotten about how close we were becoming before he knew my real age, but of course neither of us had forgotten and attraction doesn\u2019t just disappear when you know something is forbidden, if anything it becomes stronger. \nStill, I was there giving him all the attention in the word and spending more and more hours thinking about him and getting nothing back. This began to feel negative as it started reminding me of situations with boys my own age again which I\u2019d usually never accept this treatment from and would just forget about if it got to this point... The only reason I didn\u2019t want to move on from Sam, despite this unequal dynamic, was because I knew by him not speaking to me, he wasn\u2019t being immature but he was actually doing the right thing and respecting the rules\ud83d\ude43. That\u2019s the type of person he is, he likes rules and regulations and I could tell he was slightly angry at himself for feeling this way about me. \n\nThis odd dynamic went on for a month or so until one day when everything changed. I went out to town with my dad and when I got home I got a message from him saying \u201cHey I think I just saw you in town walking with your Dad\u201d! This was exciting as it was the first time our \u201cfriendship\u201d had translated into real life as he had seen me and I think we began to feel more like REAL PEOPLE to each other. I told him \u201cYou should\u2019ve said hi!\ud83d\ude04\u201d  and this is where it got fun because the whole forbidden part came back. He said \u201cImagine a random man shouting out of his car window at you in front of your dad\u201d... and he said \u201cI think you know what I mean\u201d.  The code language a  todd and the unspoken words felt like we were sharing this special secret and that we knew we weren\u2019t even supposed to be messaging or talking but we didn\u2019t want to stop. \nBecause I also trusted him that he\u2019d be responsible about it, and I think he had then realised that I wasn\u2019t an immature girl who\u2019d go and tell anyone about our friendship, it felt so fun and exciting to just finally acknowledge our forbidden connection again. He  complimented me for the first time in a loooong time \u263a\ufe0f and said I looked nice when he saw me walking. He said he really wanted to meet me and hang out but that (because like I said we live on a small island), people he knows might see him with a younger girl and that would obviously be terrible for his reputation. \nI have to say though, since then, he\u2019s acting more and more willing to meet me some time soon as it\u2019s so tempting considering we live like 20 minutes away! \n\nThis type of stuff kept happening and his behaviour became very inconsistent as his morals and temptations were basically in a conflicting battle. He was trying to stay in control of his temptations but wasn\u2019t completely succeeding as I will say he has an impulsive side to his nature. What makes it better though is that he also has a careful side (like what I said about the child-like vs sensible parts of his character). \nSo it was like one day he would be responding to a selfie I posted with a compliment, and other days he\u2019d not contact me at all and even try and get to know other girls his own age which luckily didn\u2019t work for various reasons lol. \nI had concerns about the fact that he was acting on his temptations with me, as I felt like that wasn\u2019t very responsible, but from knowing him, it was so obvious to me that it was not something he would ever usually do and it was specific to me. Plus he\u2019s subtle and never takes anything too far or to an even remotely sexual level. I\u2019m telling you, me and him have some kind of crazy emotional connection! \n\nHis behaviour was unintentionally (i hope) leading me on so much but it wasn\u2019t in a way that I was getting hurt. This was because I wasn\u2019t too emotionally invested due to the fact that he had already made clear from the start that he was not the type who was going to have relations with underage girls! He didn\u2019t even have to tell me this for me to realise it as soon as I watched his live streams and saw how responsible of a character he so obviously was.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll end this now \ud83d\ude05 but I hope it kind of gave an insight into the thrill of everything going on in my \u201clove life\u201d right now because not everyone gets to experience a forbidden relationship with someone whilst also having a huge amount of respect for the person that is (I think) justifiable . It is a feeling I\u2019ve never felt about someone before and they are getting stronger every time I interact with him and I can only hope it translates when we begin to meet in person, and when it isn\u2019t \u201cillegal\u201d or necessarily \u201cforbidden\u201d anymore. I don\u2019t want to think too far into the future with it because regardless of what happens, I\u2019ve enjoyed this rollercoaster of emotions and you can let go of memories but not necessarily forget them, and this is a memory I\u2019ll never forget.", "title": "Isabella and Sam\u2019s forbidden love story \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udeab"}, {"created_utc": 1597292472, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/i8t9zw/how_long_do_you_generally_like_a_girl_forcrush_on/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "How long do you generally like a girl for/crush on her?

Admittedly, I fucked up. I made you feel rejected. I hurt you. And I'm sorry. However, I think it\u2019s important to make it clear how I feel. To tell you the truth. To allow you to peer into my mind. To explain and come to grips with the way I acted. To give both you and me some sort of a foundation from where we can continue our lives without hate or negativity towards each other. This isn\u2019t closure. This isn't me moving on. This is me accepting the reality that I face, and moving forward into it. So here you go.\n\n\u201cOver the past couple of months, I've spent a lot of time with myself. I admit, over this period I didn\u2019t think about you as often as I had been previously used to. During this time, I didn\u2019t set out with any specific goal in mind. I just wanted to become a more fulfilled person. I wanted to find myself. I wanted to take advantage of this time away from the craziness of college, and from the anxiety and self-doubt that it inevitably leads me to feel. I think that in a lot of ways I have become more complete. I have become a stronger version of my previous self. It\u2019s crazy where the mind can take you when it's not being controlled by fear, ego, and pride. Up until talking to you a few days ago, I honestly thought I had changed in regards to how I viewed the potential for a relationship, too. I thought that our relationship was over. I think that distance and time had a huge part to play in why I felt that way. But now, after talking with you, I realize that you are still the woman that I want to be with.\n\nLet me start by saying that I feel ashamed. I feel ashamed for taking your love as a guarantee. When you showed me that you still wanted me even after I had rejected you outright, I assumed that I had you in my pocket. I didn't see our relationship as something that needed more effort on my part in order to survive. I thought you were all mine, no matter what. I'm sorry that I am so selfish sometimes. I didn\u2019t give you the attention, devotion, and love that you deserve. I took advantage of your feelings and emotions.\n\nThe fact that you stood with me through thick and thin says a lot about your character. You're unbelievably kind, thoughtful, patient, compassionate, curious, motivated, and loving. The way you approach life gives me hope. Everyday you showed me that I can overcome any obstacle. You taught me how to be happy even when it seemed impossible at times. And most of the time, you provided me with the only happiness that I had. You are a fighter, a leader, and a motivator. You never give up. You make me laugh with your familiar sense of humor, inspire me with unceasing perseverance, and make me grateful for everything I have. On top of all of that, you are one of the only people outside of my family that knows the real me, and chooses to love me still.\n\nWhat devastates me the most is the fact that it took me to lose you to realize a lot of these things. Of course, my ideas and opinions of you developed throughout our relationship. But often the development was blinded by my own superficial pursuit. I was only happy when I was with you. Thus, I thought that you robbed me of my happiness in other areas. But it was never your fault. I should\u2019ve seen that instead of chasing what made me unhappy, I should've devoted more of myself to you. I should've doubled down on my effort in our relationship, and on improving my self and my mindset, too. Instead, I choose to chase the things that never brought me happiness in the first place. \n\nThe fact is that I am not perfect. I am far from it. I'm a hypocrite. My anger overflows onto others. Sometimes, I am not happy with who I am. And sometimes, I wasn't strong enough to realize that my faults lied with me, not you. It took a lot of pain and suffering to be happy again. On my end and on yours. However, my negative emotions should not have affected you in the ways they undoubtedly did. It was my fault that I let them hurt you. I needed to be there for you when you cried. I needed to laugh with you when you were happy. I needed to realize what I had when I had it. But, a lot of the time, I didn\u2019t. And I feel ashamed. I'm ashamed of myself because of the fact that I didn't treat such a magnificent human being with the same level of compassion that they showed me. And I'm ashamed for not realizing it after the many chances that I had. I was manipulative. I hurt you. I labeled you. I put you down to pull you back up again. My love was like the tide. And you were the beach. I pulled away, to make you want me. I came back to be the hero. To make you need me. And that's the wrong way to go about developing trust and intimacy in a relationship. Those habits were toxic, and I apologize for putting you through them.\n\nIn some ways, I believe that hurt people hurt people. In a lot of ways, that was manifested in our relationship. Like you said, it's hard to love somebody else if you don't even love yourself. In all honesty, I didn't love myself. It might be hard to believe, since when I was with you I often seemed at peace. But you might not know that throughout my first year of college you were the only person whose compliments I could believe. We met and fell in love during the worst time in my life. I fell in love with you so easily because I felt like I had nothing else. And I opened myself up to you because I thought nobody else cared to listen. I think those thoughts and feelings still play a big role in why I feel the way I do about you today. You were there for me even when I wasn't there for myself. My family was chaotic. My mind was a mess. I didn't feel worthy or enough, really for myself or anybody else. On top of that, other people, people that I considered \u201cfriends\u201d, made it worse. They called me stupid, retarded, autistic, etc. All the time. And I began to believe them. And it ate away at my soul. It made me a toxic person. And that toxicity spilled over onto you. I'm so sorry that I let it. I wasn't strong enough to stop my self-hate from affecting you. And those emotions really damaged our relationship. They confused me. They told me the source of my sadness wasn't myself, it was other people. They led me to believe that in order to be happy I had to change the minds and perceptions of those hateful people. I realize now that such a task is impossible. Instead of loving the person who was always there for me, and building on top of our existing relationship, I believed that I had to adapt to their view of what I should become, in order to be happy again. When you're depressed, and it won't go away, you continue to search for answers. Instead of searching for answers outside of myself I should've looked within. I'm not perfect. That mindset led me to make huge mistakes in our relationship. And I had to come to grips with those faults. That took a while to accomplish.\n\nThe truth is, you are a perfectly imperfect, unrepeatable miracle of the Universe. And we are both misfits with crazy, colorful, chameleon souls. You have taught me so much about myself, both through my failures with you, and through the good times we had together. There has never been anybody that I could spend countless hours with while simultaneously being entertained, absorbed, loved, happy, and grateful with, besides you. There has never been anybody that I have loved as much as you.\n\nMore than anything, I hope you understand that I am sorry for the names I called you. I'm sorry for my outbursts. There is no excuse. I believe that I am a good person, but I make mistakes. I get jealous. I'm not always clear headed. Im human. I have a lot to learn about myself and about how to treat people. Especially with those whom I have a close connection to. I think I have grown into a better person in the last 7 months. I've done a lot of reflecting and self-talk. Being back with my family has also helped my confidence and character. Knowing that they are okay without me has taken a huge weight off my chest. I feel less confused, less alone, less anxious. I feel more stable. I know now to value what I have more than to value what others claim I should. I value you. I love you. I want to love you longer. The feeling I get when we talk is the same feeling I had when we first met, only much stronger. I want to commit to you so that we grow better together, if you give me the chance to prove it. I've learned that the grass is not greener on the other side. It is greener where you water it. That was a hard lesson to learn.\n\nI think about these things all the time. Sometimes you just know when shit is real. I reminisce about the small details of your character that make you who you are. That made me fall in love with you. I think a lot about the scars that I left you. I hate that I made you feel rejected. I'm angry at myself because I hurt you. I think our love was like a drug. Addiction, dependence, and withdrawal were commonplace. But it was and is also a journey. We've struggled, been beat down, made fun of, persevered, and risen above, together. Our love has been and always will be complex. That's what makes it unique.\n\nIn all honesty, the experiences we have had in our relationship have taught me a lot. They have taught me that in order to be ready for a relationship, I have to be ready to accept myself for who I am. I have to explore myself and my options. If I leave options unexplored, I will always be scared of what could have been. I'll become toxic. I'll doubt you, and myself. To learn and grow you have to do it on your own. Because of that, I'm scared that I'm not ready for another try. I'm worried that there are still options unexplored, and that if we get back together the same pattern of toxicity may continue. I'm terrified of the possibility that this cycle could continue again, and that eventually you would just want absolutely nothing to do with me if in fact I hurt you again. I'm unsure if I want to take that risk. That risk being a complete, long term loss of any potential relationship we could have in the future as a result of rushing into a relationship today. But I'm also scared that if I let you go, you may not come back. I'm afraid to lose you. I can't imagine having you be a closed door in every way. I'm afraid to grow apart. I think it may be a better option to leave the future open for possibilities so that one day we maybe can have a fulfilling and long term relationship, if in fact we decide that's what we want, rather than rushing into a relationship that may be built on a faulty foundation as soon as possible. In fact, that is how I felt earlier this summer. I was just afraid. I was afraid that I wasn't ready, and that the cycle would repeat. And instead of communicating, I just froze, and then retreated. I should have communicated with you, regardless of how I felt. It was the right thing to do and I didn\u2019t do it. I'm not going to make that mistake again. \n\nIt takes a step back to see these things for how they actually are. To see the past for how it actually happened. It takes time to learn from mistakes. It takes consequences. I believe that I am now a better person, in a lot of ways. Yet, I am still that person that you fell in love with. Honestly, I feel like I want to be back in your life. I feel like our souls are on a crash course. I feel like we are meant for each other. Like we were born from the same supernovae. Regardless of when and if it happens, if we do start dating again I need you to realize something. It will be challenging to overcome some of our past mistakes. It will be challenging to balance other areas in our life, too, such as work, friends, school, etc. But I need you to know that I believe that you are worth fighting for. I believe that we are worth fighting for. I know that our relationship wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was real. I need you to understand that I promise that I will always be tougher than any situation that we face. And in any situation that we do face, I promise that we will face it together. I promise that we will overcome it, together. I want to be where you lay your head at night. I want to be your summer. I want to embrace your chameleon soul, and cheer you on in every endeavor in your life. I want to be the one to cuddle you. I want to be the one to pepper you with compliments and cute names. I want to be the face you wake up to every morning. I just want to be yours. Whatever happens, I will love you and support you unconditionally always. No matter what. You will always have a place in my heart. I wish you nothing but the best in life.\u201d", "title": "My (20 M) love letter to my ex (22 F).

Typical romcom huh? I can remember staring at you almost the whole day and days after.  I remember when I told you how I felt, you told me you didn't feel the same about me. I tried shaking it off and ran to my bus. That night I cried. Thinking I were ugly and unlovable. Boy, did the next day change me. I remember after school, you were on your bike on the way home and you told me that you liked me too but were pressured.\n\nYou became my boyfriend and I were your girlfriend. I remember how everyone suddenly wanted to talk to me. Having a bf in 7th grade is apparently a big deal. But, since we were so young we were so awkward. We never spent time all alone, we always were around friends. We were together for almost 2 months. I felt like you didn't care since I barely got any attention. It was summer after all so couldn't expect too much. \n\nI remember on the last day in 7th grade the class slept over at our school. I remember it being a lot of pressure for use to kiss. I had never kissed anyone so I were of course nervous. You tried to kiss me twice but, I thought you wanted a hug. We then went into a like shed where we kissed. It wasn't magical tbh. It was too much force 100%. Then people ran in, trying to catch us but, they were too late. I really treasure our moments even though we were so young and new to it.

I admit, I didn\u2019t think of you as much as I did before. But during this time I didn\u2019t set out with any specific goal in mind. I just wanted to become a more fulfilled person. I wanted to find myself. I wanted to take advantage of this time away from the craziness of college life, and from the anxiety and self-conscientiousness that it inevitably leads me to feel. I think that in a lot of ways I have become more complete. It\u2019s crazy where your mind can lead you if you don\u2019t try to control it. Up until talking to you, I thought I had changed in regards to how I felt about you. I thought I was over our relationship. I think distance and time have a part to play in why I felt this way. But now, after talking to you, I realize that you are still the woman that I want to be with. \n\nI feel ashamed for taking your love as a guarantee. When you showed me that you still wanted to be with me after those couple of months of us not talking after we broke up, I assumed wrongly that it meant I had you in my pocket. I didn\u2019t see our relationship as something that needed more effort on my part in order to survive. I though that you were all mine. I\u2019m sorry that I am so selfish sometimes. I didn\u2019t give you the attention, devotion, and love that you deserve. I took advantage of your feelings and emotions. \n\nYou\u2019re unbelievably kind, thoughtful, compassionate, curious, and loving. The way you approach life gives me hope. Everyday you showed me that I can overcome any obstacle. You taught me how to be happy even when it seemed impossible to me at times. You provided me that happiness. You are the only person outside of my family that knows the real me. And the fact that you stood by me in thick and thin says a whole lot about your character. You are a fighter, a leader, and a motivator to me. You don\u2019t ever give up. You make me laugh with your familiar sense of humor, inspire me with the perseverance that you have shown all your life, and make me grateful for the things and people that I have. \n\nWhat makes me sad the most is the fact that it took me to lose you to realize a lot of these things. Of course, my ideas and opinions of you developed throughout our relationship. But I was blinded by a superficial pursuit. I was only happy when I was with you. Thus, I thought you robbed me of my happiness in other areas. But it was never your fault. I should\u2019ve seen that instead of chasing what made me unhappy, I should\u2019ve devoted more to you. I should\u2019ve doubled down on my effort in our relationship and on improving myself to be better to you, rather than trying to find happiness in things that never brought me it in the first place. \n\nThe fact is that I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m far from it. I\u2019m a hypocrite. My anger overflows onto others. Sometimes, I am not happy with who I am. And sometimes, I wasn\u2019t strong enough to realize that my faults lied with me, not you. It took a lot of pain and anger and sadness to be happy again. On my part, and on yours. However, my negative emotions shouldn\u2019t have affected you in the ways that they did. It was my fault that I let them hurt you. I needed to be there for you when you cried. I needed to laugh with you when you were happy. I needed to realize what I had when I had it. But, often times, I didn\u2019t. And I feel ashamed. I\u2019m ashamed of myself that I couldn\u2019t treat such a magnificent human being with the same level of compassion that they showed me. And I\u2019m ashamed for not realizing it after the many chances that I had. I was manipulative. I hurt you. I labeled you. I put you down to pull you back up again. My love was like the oceans tide. And you were the beach. I pulled away, to make you want me . I came back, to be the hero. To make you need me. And that\u2019s the wrong way to go about developing trust and intimacy in a relationship. Those types of behaviors were toxic, and I\u2019m sorry that I put you through them. \n\nIn some ways, I believe that hurt people hurt people. In a lot of ways, that was manifested in our relationship. Like you said, it\u2019s hard to love if you don\u2019t love yourself. In all honesty, I didn\u2019t love myself. But, countless times you have proven that cliche incorrect. You are a perfectly imperfect, unrepeatable miracle of the Universe. You have taught me so much about myself, both through my failures with you, and through the good times that we had together. There has never been anybody that I could spend countless hours with while simultaneously being entertained, absorbed in the moment, feeling loved, happy, and grateful with, besides you. There has never been anybody that I have loved as much as you.\n\nMore than anything, I hope you understand that I am sorry for some of the names I called you. There is no excuse. I think I am a good person, but I make mistakes. I have outbursts. I get jealous. I\u2019m not always clear headed. I\u2019m human. I have a lot to learn about myself and about how to treat people. Especially those with whom I have close connections to. I think I have grown into a better person in the last 7 months. I done a lot of reflecting and self-talk. I know now to value what I have more so than to value what other people claim I should want. I value you. I love you. And I want to commit myself to growing into a better person with you, if you give me the chance to prove it. The grass is not greener on the other side. It is greener wherever you water it. That is a lesson that I have had to learn. \n\nI think about us all the time. Sometimes you just know when shit is real.  I think about the scars that I left you. I think our love was like a drug. I also reminisce about the small details of your character that make you who you are. That made me fall in love with you. It takes a step back to see these types of things. I believe that now I am a better person in a lot of ways. Yet, I am still that person that you once fell in love with. I want to be back in your life, and to give you my all. I want to dance, with you. I know it will be challenging to balance out the other areas of my life, but I believe in fighting for a chance to be with you again. I can\u2019t promise that it will be easy. But I can promise that I will always be tougher than any situation we face. And in any situation that we do face, I promise that we will overcome it together. I will love you and support you unconditionally always. No matter what. You will always have a place in my heart. And I wish you nothing but the best in life. \n\n\u201cThough I tried not to hurt you\nThough I tried\nBut I guess that's why they say\nEvery rose has its thorn\nJust like every night has its dawn\nJust like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song\nEvery rose has its thorn\u201d", "title": "A love letter from me (20 M) to my ex (22 F)"}, {"created_utc": 1597163991, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/i7v2wc/covid_love/", "num_comments": 15, "score": 1, "selftext": "Ive been away from my fiance due to Covid and its killing me. \n\nShe lives in Canada and I live in the US .The damn borders are closed so we cant see each other.  \n\nWe Facetime every single day and Ive sent her countless flowers and cards expressing my love for her. \n\nThis covid love is ripping us apart.

Ever since I was a little girl, I knew that a \u2018happily ever after\u2019 is a far cry away from reality...I believed that for years. Even when I was in a passionless, numb, loveless relationship. I thought it was love...it wasn\u2019t. Looking back on it, I wasn\u2019t loved. I was trying to build a relationship with someone whom took everything I had and never gave anything back. In the beginning he had, but once he knew my loyalty would allow me to continue to be with him even if he hurt me so...he didn\u2019t have to try anymore. I stayed with him. Numbly saying \u201cI love you.\u201d because I felt obligated to. I never knew what it was like to fall in love until I saw another. We met at the mall, he in a Spider-Man suit, I in a Mickey Mouse back pack. I tried to say \u201chello\u201d as I wanted to get to know this man dressed as Spider-Man just because in public. He nodded and looked away. I figured he just didn\u2019t like my vibe which is understandable. Disney Adults aren\u2019t for everyone. But he was really cute, and way out of my league. I continued in my numb relationship for a couple years after, all the while stealing glances to look at him. Purposely walking by him to get close, and always noticing every-time he walked in the room. Then we finally got to talking. Once a week at first, then everyday. Soon we were talking about everything and nothing all day everyday. Finally, I had enough of the loveless relationship I was in, my mental health declined so much many told me I didn\u2019t act, look or seem like myself anymore. He called me that day, to make sure I was ok after I ended things with my now ex. He didn\u2019t have to do that but he did. And slowly my crush grew. One night we were up late talking about our interests, past relationships and many other topics. I wanted to tell him so bad, as if he read my mind, he confessed. As did I. We are now taking things day by day. Learning more and more about each other. He took me on a proper date, my first proper date...ever. He\u2019s patient with me, understands me like no one ever has. I\u2019m so comfortable with him it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s so easy. I feel like I\u2019m not fighting a losing battle anymore. He\u2019s not afraid to have tough conversation or make sure that I\u2019m comfortable with anything we are doing. He was even able to talk my through an anxiety attack and stayed up all night on the phone while I slept to make sure I was ok. That has never happened before... I love Disney. I love the happily ever afters, the happy endings, the romance, the theme of true love. Why? Cause I believe in it. Don\u2019t let anything stop you from finding love, not fear, not anxiety, not anything. When you find true love, time won\u2019t matter, fear won\u2019t matter.

I met her when I moved into the neighbourhood I still live in today and had a crush on her from the first time I laid my eyes on her. Over the 9 years we\u2019ve remained close and no matter how long we go without talking (usually not very long) we always pick up right back where we left off like nothing happened. Our friends have always told us we need to date and our bfs/gfs have always HATED me or her. It\u2019s not just an ordinary friendship, we hang out 1 on 1 all the time and have for years. Flash forward to last summer, she was in the middle of a relationship with the guy she\u2019s still with now (i\u2019ll get to that later) and she told me she was in love with me and it\u2019s gonna work out just not now. Well, I didn\u2019t take that very well and then some more bad things kept coming up in my life and as a result I went off the deep end, getting balls deep into depression which led to drugs and a bad lifestyle. Flash forward, to roughly 9 months after that, I finally made the decision to quit the bullshit and get my life back in order and ended meeting a nice gal that I pursued and dated for a few months. The last time I saw this individual before we broke up I was with a close friend that met her for the first time and the first thing he told me when we left was that she reminded him of Beth and she broke up with me for other reasons the very next day. \n\nThat was about 3 months ago now and all of the sudden recently Beth has been wanting to constantly be around me even more than usual. She looks for opportunities to hang out 1 on 1 and she\u2019s been very flirtatious. The only weird exception is when we\u2019re in groups she\u2019ll still be closest to me normally but she\u2019s not as obvious about the flirting. The other night, we drove up about 20-30 mins for milkshakes and the entire car ride there wasn\u2019t an ounce of silence. That\u2019s when I started to suspect that maybe this isn\u2019t some bullshit high school love nonsense. After further evaluation, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I am in love with her and here\u2019s why:\n\n1. I can talk to her about literally anything and it\u2019s never awkward (can be myself)\n\n2. I\u2019m always completely in the moment when i\u2019m talking to her\n\n3. She knows me down to my core \n\n4. Shes the person I would want to do daily tasks with (grocery shopping, car rides, anything)\n\n5. She\u2019s invested in my life, she knows my parents and all of my friends \n\n6. No matter how bad of a place I was in, she ALWAYS stayed there for me no matter what\n\n7. I cannot/do not imagine a life without her in it\n\n8. I genuinely just want her to be happy \n\nI could honestly go all day but these are the main points. \n\nWell now here\u2019s the problem. She has a boyfriend and they\u2019ve been together for over a year. I really feel like I need to do something and talk to her but I don\u2019t want to give her a split decision or give her any ounce of pain. On the other hand, life is short and I don\u2019t want to wait too long and miss an opportunity. She doesn\u2019t talk about him all that much and when she does it\u2019s not necessarily positive so that would lead me to believe she\u2019s not as happy as she should be but it\u2019s hard to tell.\n\nAny valuable feedback in terms of how I move forward?", "title": "In love with bestfriend of 9 years"}, {"created_utc": 1597147582, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/i7qln5/on_buying_a_lego_death_star/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Yesterday when my boyfriend and I sat on the sofa and looked at memes, we saw [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/i75s16/legos_are_for_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). \\[Comic about a kid bringing home a Lego house, then the kid as an adult with his own kid, him bringing home a Lego Death Star and his kid bringing home a Lego house\\]\n\nWe don't plan to have kids, but we do like Lego and Star Wars.

So bare with me.\n\nBackground: my mother always forced me to have long hair until I was 10, then she let me get my hair cut to chin length with bangs. It's been a look I rocked on and off between 10 and currently. Mainly because long hair annoys me.\n\nEx-Boyfriends and Ex-Fiance's opinions about my hair, depended on the guy. Some didn't have an opinion, and others liked it longer, my Ex-Fiance takes the cake. He tried to demand that my hair be long and flowy! Called me a fairy elven princess of spring and light, when I'm actually a little dark goth princess with blonde rocker girl exterior. (My parents and my situation at the time was very restrictive of how I could present myself even after I'd been past 18.) Anyway, my Ex-Fiance would bring up compliments on my long hair and it sounded like he was complimenting his precious 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl.' I didn't quite understand these compliments at the time, but they made me uneasy.\n\nCut to my current Fiance. Since Quarantine, I haven't been able to cut my hair, so my bangs have become long and annoying. The rest of my hair, same deal. I can't clean at work or at home without pulling all of my hair back. Now, my fiance won't let me pull my hair back anymore for now. (He thinks he's found the start of a bald spot in the shape of the headband I use to pull my bangs back over my head.) And he's admitted to me, that he loves long hair. He said it in a way that sounds genuine and from his heart. He told me how ever since he was a kid, he was always swooning over adult women with long hair, and mentioned that his previous girlfriends didn't let their hair get long. One had a Karen haircut and the other cut her hair similar to my go-to cut.

Guys, I cannot tell you how amazing it was to be on vacation with her. It felt so amazing to have an apartment all our own, and to do things the way WE wanted to do them without parental supervision (we still live at home). We cooked for ourselves, and made a pizza together! We went out to a super fancy dinner for her birthday on Friday, and it honestly made me feel so happy. On Saturday we went horseback riding for the first time, and it was an amazing experience. She laughed as the horse almost made me fall off twice, but seeing her laugh made my whole day. Sunday, we visited Hershey Park (we followed COVID guidelines and stayed off rides, always had our masks on and used hand sanitizer so we were very safe) and had a blast. We visited the ZooAmerica and saw our favorite animals and then visited many of the shops Hershey had to offer. We even got a caricature done, which I\u2019ve never done with anyone else before. I nearly cried when I saw it, it was almost perfectly- just us. Today we visited a local PA zoo, and got to feed baby goats which she melted over and I loved as well. And then we drove through to an Amish market and went back home. Never in my life did I think it would be this much fun. I\u2019m a guy who counts the seconds we\u2019re on vacation and can\u2019t wait for them to end. This time was different- I was counting the opposite way, and praying it would never end and we could live this way all our lives. As I helped pack her car when we got home, we both cried because of how amazing and emotional it was. Even now as I write this, I\u2019m crying because of how much fun I had and how much I wanna do it again.

I have no idea tbh.

I only had like a month before moving out of my country( 2 weeks have gone by so now I still have 2 weeks to go) to study abroad.

So after doing some reflection I decided to drop it as a long distance relationship is already painful for the both of us, her being 8 years older than me well...

Our section was recently changed so there were a lot of new students whose faces were known to me but we never ever talk earlier, but we knew one guy, he was a popular kid and I had known him since childhood so I and my friend Rajan sat with Pawan, the popular kid. Since Pawan and Rajnandini were earlier classmate and were also kind of best friends, we sat right behind Rajnandini\u2019s bench. There were two more girls with Rajnandini: Archana and Sneghna. Pawan knew those two girls also as they were also his classmate. So the first day wasn\u2019t that good because I was missing my old friends though I still had some of them in that class too. Me and Rajnandini didn\u2019t talk the first couple of days but I after hearing all my lame but impressive jokes and also my cuteness, it made her talk to me, apparently the first thing she said to me was that she didn\u2019t like the section that I was in earlier as she considered the students of that section arrogant and also creepy. I was offended but it was the first day talking so I forgave her. After that day, we talked each other every single day, we became very good friends, but my friendship with her went to a wrong direction. I started to create feelings for her but as I recently broke up with my Ex-Girlfriend was trying to ignore those feeling as I didn\u2019t wanted to be in a relationship again but the feelings became stronger and stronger every day. I kept hiding my feeling because I was scared, I had a fear of losing our friendship and that kept me away from proposing her. Some days, I noticed an odd behavior of her which made me think that she has feelings for me but I kept rejecting those thought until one day.\n\nIt was teachers day we had a celebration in our school, Rajnandini and I didn\u2019t get much time to talk with each other that day because i was totally into the football match that was being held in school, we enjoyed whole day and finally came back home. I laid down in the bed with the phone and on checking the notifications I saw a message from Rajnandini, she said I wanted to talk about something important, I took it as a joke and replied to it but I was wrong it wasn\u2019t a joke she was serious, she proposed me. I was in shock but without thinking a second time, I agreed to her proposal and said \u201cI love you too\u201d  \n\n# How it went\n\nWe were in a relationship, first of all I am a passionate lover, but when I try to talk to her face to face it felt like we barely know each other. I became a nervous bitch but while chatting through WhatsApp I wasn\u2019t nervous at all, I was that passionate lover in WhatsApp. After a month of this relationship we felt like we are made for each other and that this relationship can never be broken. On our 1 month anniversary we planned to meet with each other outside school, it was kind of like a date but the venue was my friend\u2019s house. I convinced my mother to allow me to go saying that we had to shoot a video for my YouTube Channel. On arriving there I saw her and I was stunned to see how beautiful she looks without the school uniform, we didn\u2019t talk much in our way to Rajan\u2019s Home as both of us were shy. Rajan decided to take us to a view point so we started our journey to the destination. On the way I tried to bring up a conversation but it turned into a cringe shit talk though I managed to make her smile and laugh. After a lot of walking, running, jumping and whatever a teenager can do, we reached our destination and the view from that spot was amazing. I had a plan of kissing Rajnandini that day but I wasn\u2019t able to manage the guts and also I had never kissed a girl before so again I became a nervous bitch but she managed to gather the guts to kiss me in my cheeks, she actually had an experience in these things as she had kissed her ex-boyfriend. That small kiss on the cheek paved for the end. After the kiss I was shocked, I rubbed my cheeks just to remove any lipstick marks so that no one notices it, she didn\u2019t react much later on. After coming home I texted her saying her what my plan was and she replied \u201ctoday was the best day!\u201d\n\nThe next day in school her opinion on the kiss totally changed right after Pawan said, \u201cYaar Rajnandini how did you fall in love with, he didn\u2019t even kiss you back\u201d I didn\u2019t pay attention to what he said but Rajnandini replied to him by saying\n\n\u201cYou are right yaar, even I don\u2019t know how I fell in love with him, I mean he rubbed his cheek after the kiss and had such a bad reaction in his face, that day I felt like breaking up with him\u201d \n\nI was broken from inside after hearing to what she said. It was the first time that a girl kissed so I was shocked even though I said this thing to her earlier also but her behavior completely changed in front of them. I am a very polite person so I keep forgiving people and so I did forgive her again.\n\nWell little did I know, things like this started to happen every day, every day she would say something in front of me and something else in front of her friends. I was being criticized, humiliated, and made fun of by her friends and also by her too in front of me. Sometimes it\u2019s just a joke but sometimes it\u2019s serious. I kept tolerating all those things just because I loved her and I didn\u2019t want to make her sad.  \n\n# How it started to End\n\nI became good friends with Archana and Sneghna too. They too were also involved in humiliating and criticizing me instead of Archana she didn\u2019t talked much about that topic and always to move away from the topic, I never understood why she did that, maybe she had a crush on me or maybe she was simply not interested. \n\nSomeday I avoided talking with Rajnandini as sometimes she would be angry on me for some reason and I didn\u2019t talk to not make the situation worse and sometimes while trying to concentrate in the class, I tried to ignore or avoid her. I might have done wrong but I was just a student and studies were my first priority. Now this thing of mine triggered her always, she never tried to understand why I did it, the only thing she wanted was my attention and that I always have to be talking to her. I didn\u2019t like those things, I never did, but I tried to improve myself and was becoming one of those \u2018Lovey-Dovey\u2019 boys. I was losing control of myself.\n\nOne day she tried to hold my hands in class but it didn\u2019t happen as I wasn\u2019t able to understand that she was trying to hold hands. The second day when she tried to do the same thing, she was successful in it, she was holding my hands in school and inside a classroom and then it too became an everyday thing. We hold each other\u2019s hand every day in class, other student noticed us doing this but few of them reacted to it. Everything was going fine until one day, I don\u2019t know why but something happened which made her very angry and sad, I didn\u2019t understand what was it so I didn\u2019t bother myself trying to know what happened and was concentration in the class. She out of anger said about a boy who was her neighbor and his penis size, it\u2019s the second time now, I didn\u2019t react much to, but I gave a surprised look to her. I assumed she was doing it just to grab my attention, but she didn\u2019t even realize what just came out of her mouth, I was done with her, I decided to end this relationship then and there but I wasn\u2019t able to gather the guts to say it in front of her, so I made it to her later on through WhatsApp.\n\nI said \u201clisten you are a really awesome girl, but I have had enough of your melodrama and all and I thing I can\u2019t take this anymore, I think we should break up\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t say anything for a few minutes but finally her reply came. She was trying her best to convince be back and she was successful to convinced me to again forgive her. Little did I know I was being controlled by her, I was being manipulated, I became a living robot but as I loved her I accepted my fate. I kept improving myself for her and as I was improving myself, I was distancing away from my old friends things changed from that point as I was becoming more of a daring person.

We meet many different people, someone better than others but all are amazing in their own special ways. Then there are those that we meet that at the moment we don't realize it. We don't realize that as the days go by a feeling inside us starts to grow. That one day it will sneak up on us and we will feel different towards them. We become shy and exited every-time we see them, it's something that we can't seem to understands. We start to hang out, going out to eat, going on walks and laughing at the most random things. We feel happy inside, that if the world was to end today, you'll be okay with it because you got to spend with your favorite person. The more time we spend with them the feeling becomes stronger and stronger until we can no longer control it. These are the moments that we don't realize are the most important until it's to late. For when the time comes were both of you have to be separated by life or faith. These are the things that we'll remember. We won't remember the beautiful vacations that we ended up going, the the amazing places we explored, the beautiful necklace he/she gave you but the way the person made us feel. The laugh that made us feel tingly inside every time we heard it, the beautiful eyes that we got lost in every time, the aroma that made us feel like we were floating in the sky. It's these feeling that hurt us the most because we know that deep inside of us that we would never find someone like them. As much as you want to run towards them. As much as you want to grab your car and drive countless miles just to see them even if there is no longer hope. We have to be able to fight it even it means crying your self to sleep but it's what must be done because we realize that the road has come to end. Just like a road that comes to an end of a tall mountain where theirs nothing but darkness beneath. As time passes by we forget how they look like, we forget the way they smell,  we forget the way their voice sounds. As more days go by we forget more and more, the memories become more faded each time. They change every time we try to remember them. But that love that we once felt, the beautiful blue flame that was the size of the sun has become as small as a rock. Until the love simply goes away but it does not mean it's completely gone for there will always be a small flame that will stays with us forever. As we move on trough life, we meet people again and we start to date again but they simply don't last. Yes there are those that do last but just like everything else they come to an end. Every time this happens one small part of us dies inside us. As we become older the idea of love is just simply that an idea. The nice sunny days that we once felt inside, the days were the sun was out just like a hot summer day have become a windy dark night where we can just barely see a full moon in the sky. We stop and remember the people that we truly love for a moment, the people that we cried for, the people that we would have gave everything to stay with them. Even tough many years have passed and many relationships have also passed by there are those that we will always keep our hearts. As time goes by all we can do is simply HOPE because it is hope that keeps us moving. That one day we will find that person or meet an old soul mate to come an save us from the real world that we live in because with hope everything is possible.", "title": "HOW LOVE CHANGES US"}, {"created_utc": 1595900484, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/hz5kuv/proposing/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello all!!!\n\nI just ordered a set of rings for my boyfriend and I.

We had a out 40-50 mins, but we were more than happy with that time. We went (and are still going) to a tree around the school, with three benches, the place we got closer to each other for the first time. After half an hour, we got up, holding each other in our arms. Somehow, we talked about memes and antique vines. So I made her laugh with the \"if your name is junior, and you're really handsome, c'mon raise your hand\" vine as I sung it to her, replacing the name with hers. And then, I got the idea of the day. Let me explain. \n\nThere is this meme, where one person writes in a chat: \"if I'd say I love you, would you say it back?\" \nSo the other one replies: \"sure.\" \nSo he says \"I love you\" while the other person replies with \"it back.\" \n\nI told her about that meme and then got my guts together. (I'll show you this in a little dialogue, 'S' is myself, while 'E' is she):\n\nS: \"If I'd say I love you, what would you say?\" \nE: \"is this a serious question?\" \nS: \"uhhh, yeah I guess so.\" \nE: \"other question: if I'd say 'can I keep you', would you say yes?\"\nS: \"hmm, maybe. Most possibly.\" \n\nSounds cringe as hell i know, but im a little meme lord and so I made use of my hilariously gigantic meme knowledge. With success. We just enjoyed the moment in silence then, sharing each others warmth. Some minutes later, shortly before her piano lesson I asked again.\n\nS: \"I gotta ask you again, but what would you answer?\" \nE: \"hmm? Well, I'd most possibly say yes...\" \n\nMore minutes in silence, digged in each others coats passed, before she told me it's time for her lesson now. Both of us sighing, wishing we've had more time hugged a last time and looked in each others eyes, saying silly stuff like \"better pay attention in your lesson\" and stuff. \nThen, I had to go if I wanted to catch the bus. So after saying \"goodbye\", I added \"I love you\". And she responded \"I love you too\". We quickly kissed, for what felt like a split second both now and then, almost making me doubt we even did it, before I left. \nOn my way to the bus station, I put on a song, just as I always did. Some seconds later, I first realized how lucky I was. I couldn't believe it really happened. She made me the luckiest person on the earth that day. I will never forget it. \n\nSo that was the story of how we came together. I hope I didnt waste your time after all. And yeah i know it sounds pretty unemotional, but with her sweet voice, it was just perfect. \nI have still more stories of how she caused little heartaches for me to tell, if you want to hear them ^^.", "title": "How I confessed to my crush in the weirdest, but \"me\" way possible"}, {"created_utc": 1595881710, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/hz06fr/finally_accepted_that_i_have_a_crush_on_one_of_my/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "(F17) So I\u2019ve known this girl for almost two years, we were in some of the same classes together and we became really fast friends but we had some periods where we couldn\u2019t talk because of my now ex-girlfriend.

Time has passed and its been more than four years since we graduated from highschool and went on to college, but both of our schools are in our hometown so we still hang out pretty much everyday, and have remained just as close as we were in highschool. \n\nThe thing is, as we were starting to become better friends, i started having feelings for her. At first i thought it was just some temporary thing, that it'd pass after some time, as i was having a bit of rough period at that time and was really understanding and making sure everything's all right. But it didnt pass, the feelings only grew stronger, and now, im head over heels for her. The thing is, since we know each other, I havent had a single real relationship, there were 1night stands and stuff like that but nothing real, mainly because i was always somehow drawn to Penny, and didnt want to be unavailable in case something happened between us.\n\nFinally, heres my question: how do i tell her im in love with her, but that i completely understand that she doesnt have feelings for me and that i dont want any pity beacuse of it? Cause i want us to stay friends the way we are right now, and her rejecting me isnt a bad thing cause i'll finally be able to stop wondering what could've been and just move on, but im afraid she'll not be able to look at me the same way as she does know.\n\nSorry for the long post, still new to reddit.

David was with Amy and she was my friend and next door neighbor. The moment he looked at me I could see his soul in his eyes. \n\nHis soul looking into mine.\n\nDavid was never my boyfriend. David was my endgame, my omega. There was never any hurry. We had forever.\n\nVery innocently, every night David and I met at the coffee shop. Most of the time it was just the two of us. We talked about metaphysics and quantum physics,\u00a0life and afterlife.\nI introduced him to Richard Bach. He taught me about Carlos Castaneda,\nAnd how to inhale cigarette smoke through your ears. Much of the time our friends would join us. Everyone came to the coffee shop after midnight for cheap coffee and underage smoking. David and I were there long after everyone else left.\u00a0 Occasionally our hands would brush. It was like water drops coming together making parts whole.\n\nI met David almost every night for two years. Falling in love was slow and sweet and savored. Never telling another person that we were there for each other. Never needing to. We had forever.\n\nAnd then that night happened. We were going camping with a few friends. But when we met up, it was just David and me. We camped under the stars talking about the depth of the universe and the expense of creation. We talked about growing old together. About our children and grand-children and generations more. We talked until sunrise. I borrowed his bottle opener and our hands touched.\n\nHe kissed me.\n\nThat Fucking Perfect Kiss. Holding a moment. That could have lasted a minute.\u00a0All night. Or a lifetime.\n\nTime no longer existed. A kiss forever frozen. A kiss charged with the spark of every love of every lifetime.\u00a0\n\nAnd when our lips finally parted, I put his bottle opener in my pocket, we packed, up and drove home. He held my hand in complete silence.\n\nDavid called me that evening and professed his love for me. I cried and interrupted him. He was with Amy and I was with Eric\u00a0 and as long as that was true we could not talk anymore. I hung up on him and left town.\n\nI never told him I loved him. I knew we had forever and I could wait.\n\nTwo days later I came home. All of our friends were in Amy's driveway. Everyone was there to comfort Amy and I couldn\u2019t voice my pain.\n\nAmy told me a secret, asked me not to tell anyone. David had broken up with her. He told her he was in love with someone else.\u00a0 but he never told her who.I couldn\u2019t tell her.\n\nThe day after he broke up with her -\u00a0\nThe day after he told me he loved me -\u00a0 he got drunk and drove his car around a corner going way too fast.\n\nI never told him that I loved him. I couldn\u2019t tell her. I could never tell a soul.\nI never spoke to her or Eric again.\n\nI couldn\u2019t go to his funeral. I had to be the maid of honor at my Sister\u2019s wedding. I wore his bottle opener around my wrist with my pretty pink dress. I did not give a fuck about the judgemental glares. And I couldn\u2019t tell a soul.\n\nWhen David died I closed off the part of me that could love like that.\u00a0 That part of me that found beauty in every corner of this multi-dimensional universe.\nI didn\u2019t care whether I lived or died.\nI chased things that numbed the pain.\nI got high and slept with whoever was kind.\nA few that were not so kind.\nSearching for some sort of human connection.\nNot willing to let down my guard.\nMy forced attempts at finding love\u00a0\nWere quite the opposite of love.\n\nFor years I could vaguely mention to my close friends and children\nThat I had a friend when I was young\u00a0\nWho had died drinking and driving.\nBut I cannot tell them how fucking perfect my love for him was.\nAnd he gets to be perfect forever.\n\n\nAnd I became the girl you fucked before you realized you were gay.\n\nI was the girl you fucked that made you realize you wanted to go back to your ex. \n\nI was the girl you fucked to piss off your father, the Reverend.\n\nI was the girl you fucked the day before you met the girl of your dreams.\n\nI was the girl you fucked and then said, during that post-coital embrace,\nthat you hoped one day to marry a girl with my body\u2026.\nAnd the face, hair, and personality of my best friend.\n\nAll I wanted was out of this.\nOut of this mind.\nOut of this body.\n\nI tried marriage. He needed me.\nI thought that that was the closest to love I was going to get. I tried going through the motions of loving someone.

In fact, these strategies helped a life coach Kajal Pandey have a passionate relationship for 9+ years. So if you want more love in your relationship, you\u2019ll love her strategies and examples. I've also included other actionable strategies that work really well.\n\nLet's get started with general strategies and then move on to more specific tips.\n\n1. Get to love unconditionally by loving yourself first\n2. Open yourself to unconditional love by becoming happy\n3. Accept the other person as they are\n4. Show compassion\n5. Keep loving your kids as they grow up\n6. Learn the love language of your partner\n7. Make an actionable list of specific things your partner likes\n8. Listen deeply\n\n## 1. Get to love unconditionally by loving yourself first\n\nYou need to love yourself before you can love others unconditionally.\n\nLouise Hay wrote:\n\nEvery problem in your life comes from not loving yourself.\n\nGo from self-hate to self-love.\n\n## Example\n\nI've created this self-love ritual that helps me relax at the end of each day:\n\n\u00b7 taking a warm shower\n\n\u00b7 watching a positive video\n\n\u00b7 having dinner\n\n\u00b7 listening to an audiobook\n\nBy having this \"me time,\" I'm able to love myself (*and others*) more.\n\n## 2. Open yourself to unconditional love by becoming happy\n\nThink about why want a relationship in the first place.\n\nDo you need to feel complete? But the truth is, the other person doesn't complete you. They're not responsible for your happiness.\n\n*To be happy, you need to get your life together so that you feel complete.*\n\nThen, you'll be able to love unconditionally.\n\n## Example\n\nHer fear of death paralyzed Janet to the point that she was incapable of living. She couldn't even get out of bed in the morning. Her husband and parents had to take care of her and the kids.\n\nJanet's therapist helped her see the deep reason behind her fear: she didn't want to be a housewife but wanted to be a counselor. So Janet went through a training program and started a counseling practice.\n\nAs a result of finding her life purpose, she became happy. And now she has a huge capacity for loving her husband and kids.\n\n## 3. Accept the other person as they are\n\nThe reason we don't accept our partner is having expectations. And when they don't meet them, we withhold love. Expectations erode our ability to love the other person.\n\n## Example\n\nI expected my ex-wife to be as efficient as I was. I thought she wasted so much time talking to her girlfriends or watching videos. This resulted in conflicts that ultimately led to divorce.\n\nIt took me years to realize that I was so wrong. If I hadn't had those expectations, we could've still been together.\n\n*That's why in my recent relationships, I didn't let my expectations get in the way.*\n\n## 4. Show compassion\n\nWhenever your partner gets angry or frustrated, see it as an opportunity to practice unconditional love.\n\nIt might feel like an attack on you. But it's really a sign of the *pain they feel inside*.\n\nSo, be compassionate instead of defensive or judgmental.\n\n## Example\n\nGina, a 17-year-old, acted as if she couldn't care less about her parents. But in reality, she was afraid that they could divorce.\n\nCovering up how much she cared was her defense mechanism.\n\nHer father got triggered by her attitude. But her mother saw through it and understood the core problem. As a result, she felt compassion for Gina.\n\nThat's one of those examples of unconditional love allowing to see beyond the surface.\n\n## 5. Keep loving your kids as they grow up\n\nIt's easy to love kids when they're small. They are adorable and obedient and meet our expectations.\n\nBut as they get older, they're likely to rebel against parents' rules. That's when loving them unconditionally is a challenge. But it's also an opportunity to practice unconditional love (*and set an example for the kids*).\n\n## Example\n\nVeronica, a stepmother, had a lot of rules for her stepson, Michael. Michael didn't meet many of them. He felt she was picking on him too much. And she felt resentful.\n\nThis negative cycle had continued until Veronica picked the three most important issues:\n\n\u00b7 Don't quarrel with your little sister.\n\n\u00b7 Clean up after yourself in the kitchen.\n\n\u00b7 Wake up for school by yourself.\n\nBy *reducing the number of conditions*, she made it possible for herself to love Michael more.\n\nThat said, let's move along to more actionable examples of unconditional love.\n\n## 6. Learn the love language of your partner\n\nWe usually give love in the way we want to receive love. But that doesn't mean it's their preferred way.\n\nAsk them how exactly they want to receive it. Use the concept of love languages suggested by Andy Andrews in *The Noticer*:\n\n1. **Dogs** want words of affirmation.\n2. **Cats** like physical contact.\n3. **Goldfish** love deeds and favors.\n4. **Canaries** want undivided attention.\n\n## Example\n\nKajal's partner's love language is words and affirmations. That makes him a \"**dog**.\" And she affirms him for everything that he does, little or small.\n\nPlus, he likes acts of service like cleaning up after his cooking. That makes him a \"**goldfish**.\"\n\n## 7. Make an actionable list of specific things your partner likes\n\nKnowing your partner's love language is good. But using this knowledge to create an actionable list is even better.\n\nSo, write down everything your partner likes and don't worry about spontaneity. Following this list doesn't make your relationship inauthentic or robotic.\n\nPracticing love is very intentional, and there has to be a thought process behind it. Being intentional rather than spontaneous makes you feel more connected to the other. If you know that making coffee in the morning brings him joy, *why would you withhold that from him?*\n\nSuch acts of care are necessary for keeping the spark alive in a relationship.\n\n## Example\n\n\u00b7 I like the way you play with my hair.\n\n\u00b7 I like the way you make me coffee in the morning.\n\n\u00b7 I feel loved when you take a book out of my hands and read it to me.\n\n## 8. Listen deeply\n\nDeep listening is intently hearing the other person instead of thinking of your response. Affirm what your partner has just said to you so that it makes them feel seen and heard by you.\n\nAt the end of the day, we all want to feel seen and heard by our partner. When you do so, your partner feels your unconditional love and reciprocates.\n\n## Example\n\nAn author Stephen Covey used to take his wife on long, 2-hour drives just for talking.\n\nThis experience was transformational for both of them. Long conversations made it possible for them to share deep thoughts and emotions.\n\nFor instance, his wife told him about her fears as a teenager: she had had this fear that her father would lose his business in difficult economical times.\n\n*As a result, they connected at a deeper level, making it possible to love each other unconditionally.*\n\n## 9. Put your partner's needs first\n\nAccording to Tony Robbins, we all have 6 human needs:\n\n\u00b7 Certainty\n\n\u00b7 Variety\n\n\u00b7 Love\n\n\u00b7 Significance\n\n\u00b7 Growth\n\n\u00b7 Contribution\n\nYour goal in a relationship is to help your partner meet those needs. Otherwise, they won't feel fulfilled or happy.\n\nTo do so, you need to put your needs first. It's not easy, for sure, but it has a transformational effect:\n\n1. As you make your partner's needs a priority, you'll feel more love toward them. That's because the more love you give, the more of it you feel.\n2. And then your partner feels compelled to give you more love as well.\n\n## Example\n\nNadia called her husband, Ralf, in the afternoon while he was working at the office. She had an emotional breakdown after a fight with her mother. Nadia asked Ralf to come home and talk to her so that she could feel his love and support.\n\nHe didn't want to come because he was in the middle of an important project. Yet, he knew better because his wife's needs were a priority for him. He sighed but went home immediately anyway.\n\nThat's one of those inspiring examples of unconditional love\u2014the husband putting his wife's needs above his own.\n\n## 10. Forgive and forget\n\nPartners inevitably make mistakes in a relationship. And then the wronged partner feels resentful. It's normal but if they hold on to this resentment, the relationship will deteriorate.\n\nTo avoid it, it's important to forgive. Forgiveness is an essential component of unconditional love. Failing to forgive means withholding love and inflicting pain on both partners.\n\n## Example\n\nSean cheated on his wife, Margot. She felt crushed and couldn't stand him at first. But when she recovered a little bit, they talked.\n\nSean apologized profusely and told her about his pain. She thought of all the reasons why she wanted to forgive him. And she made an equivocal decision to forgive.\n\nThat's one of my favorite examples of unconditional love and commitment to the relationship. Without it, their marriage could've never been happy again.\n\n## 11. Make it okay to be vulnerable\n\nYour unconditional love makes it possible for your partner to share fears and concerns. They feel safe to do that because they know that you won't judge them. This helps your partner open up at a deeper level. And you strengthen the bond between you two.\n\n## Example\n\nMartin told his wife about his fears about the financial markets collapsing in March 2020. He had invested a significant sum of their savings into stock a month before. And now he was certain that his badly-timed decision would mean financial ruin for the family.\n\nHis wife supported him and told him that they would get through this together. She never blamed him for taking a huge risk. Instead, she was loving, caring, and accepting\u2014a role model of true love.\n\n## 12. Make it okay to tell the truth\n\nPeople lie because they fear the reaction of the other person. But with unconditional love, you can create an atmosphere of trust where telling the truth is appreciated in and of itself.\n\nLet the other person know that you want to know the truth no matter what it is. And if they tell the truth, you'll never punish them for what they did.\n\n## Example\n\nLilly, a teenager, didn't communicate with her parents well. Lying was one of her default behaviors.\n\nIn an attempt to improve communication, her parents asked her to always tell them the truth. As long as she did so, they would not scold her for any of her wrongdoings.\n\nLetting go of control was difficult for them, for sure. But the atmosphere of trust they created paid off. Their relationship improved and the girl's self-awareness and self-responsibility increased.\n\n## 13. Don't feel jealous of your partner's successes\n\nIt's natural to feel a prick of jealousy when your partner achieves some sort of success. You feel it because you're scared: Now that your partner is more successful, they might want to find someone better than you.\n\nLoving unconditionally frees you from this type of fear. You encourage your partner to improve and succeed instead. You see and affirm their potential. And whenever they succeed, you're the first to celebrate their achievements, big or small.\n\n## Example\n\nJenny and Oliver wanted to have kids after getting married. But Jenny's career in her fitness gym took off unexpectedly. She got promoted from a personal trainer to a manager and then to the gym manager.\n\nSuddenly, she was traveling to other gyms around the country all the time. Oliver was jealous of her successes and felt lonely because she wasn't home so often. Plus, felt that she had broken her commitment to having kids.\n\nHe could grow resentful but chose unconditional love. He never said a word about his resentment or jealousy. And he made it his job to praise Jenny and celebrate all her successes.\n\nJenny felt so encouraged by his attitude that she offered him to be a stay-home dad\u2014something she would've never brought up before. In a year, they had their first kid.\n\n## 14. Disagree in a respectful way\n\nDisagreements between partners happen all the time. It's natural because people see things from their own unique perspective. But you can love unconditionally while disagreeing.\n\nAs a result, any disagreements don't affect your relationship. And quite magically, one of the partners might change their initial opinion. Because they don't need to get defensive, they're open to considering that other opinion.\n\n## Example\n\nDuring the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, my father would not obey the quarantine. He would go to a diner and a grocery store every day. I suggested that he'd be more careful and rather stay at home. He didn't like it and I didn't insist on it. And because my suggestion was so casual and friendly, he kept thinking about it. He didn't feel the need to protect his ego. And in a few days, he changed his mind.\n\nThat's one of those examples of unconditional love when acceptance brings out the best in people.\n\n## 15. Keep the lines of communication open\n\nIt's normal to feel frustrated with your partner even when you practice unconditional love. Unconditional love is not about never getting frustrated. It's more about what you do when frustration arises.\n\nYou need to let it go slowly. Don't shut down communication just because you feel frustrated. Keeping the lines of communication open builds connection and trust. Whereas giving your partner the silent treatment is detrimental to the relationship.\n\n## Example\n\nHeidi used to give her boyfriend, Steve, the silent treatment every time she got angry with him. This was something she learned growing up. Her parents always ignored her completely after she had done something wrong.\n\nHeidi saw how she was hurting Steve and breaking trust and connection. That's when she committed to loving Steve unconditionally for 90 days. Whenever she felt frustrated, she kept talking to Steve as if nothing happened.\n\nSteve saw the shift in her and was suspicious at first. But as time passed, he kept feeling more love from her as a result. And he felt compelled to give even more love back.\n\n## ___\n\n**TL;DR;** : Learn actionable examples of unconditional love from a life coach Kajal Pandey who's had an amazing, loving relationship for 9+ years.", "title": "15 Actionable Examples of Unconditional Love for 2020"}, {"created_utc": 1586008581, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fuu45i/to_h/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "I love you!

It was the first time I felt like that, its something I never knew so far. Everything about her just leaves me agape, she's beautiful, gorgeous, everything I could dream for. What was a basic friendship turned into a strong attraction for her. I could litterally die for her. As said before, its really the first time I felt such a love, and its so strong, so authentic and so true. Everytime I spoke to her I had all the confidence I need and it was so natural. Even they way I met her was 100% natural, no hook up ap, no stupid dating app or whatever.\n\nThing that you need to know is that im an international, and im not in her country anymore. We spoke about that when I was still in her country, and she told me that she couldn't do it right now, for some personnal reasons, and I get that, I just met her at the wrong moment in her life but that's okay, life is long and things can change.\n\nBut there is one thing that thaught me that life doesn't make you any gifts : she's insanely attracted by another ethnicity. Like really crazy, I know it, her friends know it, its a fact and this destroys me. I know that its not necessarily a reason, that people can have their preferences, but she's really really attracted by this ethnicty (asians) and no matter what, her life objective will always be to be with an asian (for the moment at least).\n\nWhy did life  do this to me ? I know that the only and unique problem is me, but why does it have to happen like that ? I didn't love anyone like her in YEARS, what do i say, in my life time. I'd do everything for her, and its the first time I could say this for a girl, but as usually im unlucky and she's attracted to another ethnicty. Believe me, its one of the biggest pain knowing that its not because of you, your personnality or whatsoever but just because of your race. I always had that \"im not gonna get her anyways, im not good enough for that anyways, so just leave it...\", result of my past insecurities and lack of confidence.

After one day of being utterly bored of everything to do in my tiny room, all my homework for university completed, every video game completed, I had an epiphany.\n\nI\u2019m currently taking Russian courses (plan to minor in the language), why not find a way to communicate with people from that region and see how they are managing things and find new and interesting people to chat with (not looking for romance at all)!\n\nI signed up for Interpals later that day and began messaging people from the region I was most interested in, Russia, and began chatting straight away. Conversations were good and thought provoking and I met some very interesting people, even got to practice my language skills with several native speakers.\n\nThen, for no reason I thought \u201cHmm, I wonder what it\u2019d be like to talk to people in other countries?\u201d So I decided to check out a mix of the U.K. and Ireland.

If she had been in the same room as me I would have been to scared to approach her, but through the magic of the internet I sent a simple message \u201cHi, I was wondering if you\u2019d care to add me on Snapchat? And talk about the ways Ireland and America are different?\u201d\n\nThen I waited... and waited... and waited... in fact I basically forgot I had even sent her a message and had moved on to chatting with other people. Then I saw her reply 3 days later, \u201cYeah for sure! Here\u2019s mine : [username].\u201d I added her and we exchanged a few snaps of our homes and that was the end of it, nothing too exciting.\n\nA few days later, I posted a poem I wrote about love and loss in romance, and to my surprise she slid up to tell me it was beautiful... I was shocked and simply said \u201cI have more if you\u2019d like to read them?\u201d She immediately responded with \u201cOh yes, Absolutely!\u201d And I proceeded to send the remainder of my writings. From then on we immediately hit it off. And ended up flirting quite a bit later that evening \n\nWe began texting frequently, her staying up ungodly hours just to talk to me because of the time difference. Face timing almost daily, playing online games with one another etc. I had never in my life connected so well with someone so quickly... but that scared me. I told myself \u201cThis is just a distraction for both of us until our lives get back to normal. She\u2019ll ghost me and it\u2019ll be the end of it, it\u2019d be best to not get too attached.\u201d\n\nWe had already begin giving each other pet names and talking about things like \u201cOh when you come out to Ireland to see me I\u2019ll show you this, this and that!\u201d And one day I had to take a step back and I realized \u201cI\u2019m beginning to have strong feelings for this girl. Just hearing her voice and listening to how her day is going makes me happy? Am I just crazy for thinking this could ever possibly work?\u201d\n\nA few days later I decided to ask, \u201cDo you see this going anywhere between us more long term?\u201d She said \u201cYes of course.\u201d And I responded, \u201cEven with an ocean between us?\u201d She replied \u201cYes absolutely.\u201d Shocked I responded, \u201cI just thought I was crazy to think it could ever work.\u201d And she said \u201cI did too, but I really like you. You\u2019re amazing, we click so well, you make me laugh, you care about how I\u2019m doing, I really do want you, even if it\u2019ll be hard for a while not actually having you here. You\u2019re the best guy to ever look in my direction, I\u2019ve never gotten along with someone so quickly and in all the right ways. I don\u2019t care if there is an ocean and a virus between us, if it\u2019s supposed to happen we\u2019ll make it work.\u201d\n\nWe then exchanged mushy talk of \u201cI\u2019m so happy I met you. I never thought anything like this would happen.\u201d And the conversation slowly drifted to other things.\n\n2 weeks later I texted her, \u201cHey can you face time me, I\u2019d like to ask you something.\u201d She responded an hour later and said \u201cYes absolutely! :)\u201d When her face was on the screen I felt like a school boy trying to ask his crush out to the school dance and I simply said, \u201cI really like you [her name], I want you to stick around. Would you like to make things official? Actually be my girlfriend, despite never having touched me with your own hands or seen me outside of a screen?\u201d The smile that crept across her face as I was speaking melted my heart and she said \u201cYes, I would love to.\u201d Then we talked about ways to communicate when things get rocky in our relationship, since it is a bit unorthodox being so far apart and the conversation went really well.\n\nAnd now I have plans to fly to Ireland for a few weeks as soon as we beat COVID-19.", "title": "How COVID-19 Caused me to Fall for Someone 4,000 Miles Away"}, {"created_utc": 1585974166, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/funa19/can_you_ditch_someone_who_loves_you_a_lot/", "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Can you ditch someone who loves you a lot .??"}, {"created_utc": 1585973730, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fun6qm/ive_been_pining_over_the_same_guy_for_years_and/", "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve been pining for the same guy for years, and I\u2019m willing the universe to help everything come together.\n\nImma bout to dump my whole anthology on this guy, so sit tight if that\u2019s something you\u2019d like to read. If not, there\u2019s a **tldr** included at the bottom.\n\nLet\u2019s call him Kay. \n\nI met Kay back in high school when I\u2019d just moved to a new school in my junior year. We were both juniors and both in the drama department at our school, and we really bonded over the 2 years we knew each other in high school- seeing as we were constantly being put in roles where we had to work with each other as love interests in multiple shows. Embarrassing to admit it, but he was even my first kiss when we had to rehearse kissing for a show during our senior year. \n\nKay was always so kind and encouraging to me and joking with me. He wasn\u2019t necessarily the most social or chatty person amongst the drama department of extroverts, and didn\u2019t actively talk to most of the people in class, but he seemed to really come out of his shell and make an effort to seek me out and talk to me, which was observed by a few of our peers and pointed out to me. It made me feel special. Anytime he\u2019d see me in the hallways, he\u2019d say my name in a funny way to get my attention. It was really cute. And I really liked him. \n\nHowever, Kay had just started dating a girl a couple months before I met him, seeing as I didn\u2019t join the class with him until the 2nd semester. So he was taken, and I respected that, and never tried to make my feelings too apparent. It didn\u2019t stop me from liking him though. I, too, ended up getting in a relationship as well, during my senior year, so I tried waning my feelings for Kay during that time.\n\nBy the end of our senior year, I\u2019ll be candid, I wouldn\u2019t say we were best friends- like we never hanged out together outside of school other than in drama and for after-school performances. But I would also honestly say that we were friends, and I think we truly had our own special bond between the two of us, after being in such close quarters for 2 years. We\u2019d text within the same group chats and send the occasional snaps.\n\nAt least on my side, it really felt like we were connected somehow, even if we weren\u2019t the closest that we could be, if that makes sense. He was like \u2018my person,\u2019 when it came to drama, which was a big part of our lives and that we both mutually have passion for and respect. We could trust each other and we worked together so much that he felt familiar and comfortable to me.\n\nSo, after graduation, we both ended up going to a local community college, and to my surprise, and secret delight, we ended up taking a drama class together. We had fun and talked and laughed. I really enjoyed that semester and I could tell he did too, genuinely.\n\nAfter that, when the class was over, we\u2019d see each other occasionally whenever the alums would go back to the school for drama and we\u2019d chat and catch up once again. We\u2019d text and Snapchat sometimes here and there, but after a point, I stopped initiating it because I went through a self-worth spiral when I realized that most of the texts were one-sidedly initiated on my part, so I stopped texting him. It hurt me a little even if it wasn\u2019t intentionally malicious on his part, but it made me feel a bit pathetic. But we did still talk from time-to-time as well on social media, a nice comment to one another here and there. \n\nI realize this sounds bad since I was also in a relationship at the time and still at times, felt romantic feelings for Kay, but anytime during our interactions, I had tried to focus on the fond emotions of our friendship rather than focusing on the longing for a romantic aspect of our friendship.\n\nDuring this time, I had tried to emotionally detach myself him, because it was so bad at a point. I used to, and still do, have dreams about Kay and I would think about him so much to the point where it was making me sad. It was making me feel so pathetic at how very one-sided it seemed I was making everything in my head and heart. So, for a while, I was able to smother and lock some of my feelings for him away, if only for my own sake. I unfollowed him on Snapchat and deleted his number, so the only time I ever saw him or heard from him was on Instagram. Even so, it\u2019s like Kay would always be in the back of my mind, there and never really gone.\n\nAround a year after we graduated, I believe is the time frame, he and his girlfriend broke up. \n\nAbout a year after the college class together, I\u2019d decided to audition for my first musical out of school, and got a lead part. During this rehearsal-to-opening process, my partner and I broke up, for, just fyi, unrelated reasons not pertaining to Kay at all.\n\nOn opening night, after the show, all the actors went out into the lobby to greet the guests, and to my complete surprise and utter shock, he was there, waiting to see me. I\u2019d posted a few promotional things on my social media, but I\u2019d never asked him to come to my show and he\u2019d never given me the heads-up that he\u2019d be coming. It made me feel really nice. We hugged and he told me how he thought I did so well and it was a really great moment.\n\nA few months pass, and there\u2019s the same little comments here and there on social media and keeping up with one another. Then, he posted a promotional post for the musical his university, an hour away, was doing, seeing as he\u2019s in the theater program and it\u2019s open to the public to see it as well- which many people not attending the school do. Hyping him up, I\u2019d commented some supportive little exclamation. And Kay had replied excitedly that I should come.\n\nBeing the self-conscious person that I am, I\u2019d thought it over hard. I don\u2019t like to make myself obvious and didn\u2019t want to seem like I was desperate or weird for showing up. But I had rationalized to myself that he came to my show unannounced, and it was a lovely surprise, and he did say I should come. And so I did. But I didn\u2019t say anything about it to him.\n\nWhen everyone came out into the lobby after the show, I was nervous when I saw Kay talking with his family and- and I considered not even going up to him. But my friend nudged me to say hello, and I did. When I tapped him on the shoulder, he seemed completely frozen for a split second when he turned to see it was me, before he excitedly said my name and pulled me into a hug. And let me tell you, my romantic feelings for Kay skyrocketed as my heart pounded in my chest.\n\nWe smiled and chatted and caught up with one another. Soon enough, I was saying goodbye after informing him of my next upcoming show. I felt like I was high on happiness for the rest of that night as me and my friend drove back home. \n\nEver since then, it seems like we\u2019ve been socializing a lot more frequently. I posted something on my Instagram story about auditions for my upcoming show, and he hyped me up when he replied to my story. Of course I\u2019m secretly hoping he attends the opening night for my show if I get in. He recently found me on Tik Tok and added me and has been interacting with me more on there, dueting with me on some stuff I posted\n\nI even recently signed up for the dating app \u2018Hinge\u2019 because I\u2019d been feeling like seeing what a dating app was like and was contemplating if I\u2019d want to try dating again. And I see Kay come up on my feed- which made me immediately close out of the app and wish I had the courage to be unafraid and shoot my shot and just ask if he\u2019s interested me at all like the coward I am.\n\nSo, here I am now, hoping for the future and that the universe will throw me a bone and let things happen for me and Kay. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, I understand how I sound. Hopelessly pining over Kay, wishing he would see me like I see him, wondering if he\u2019s ever felt even a tiny bit for me as I feel for him. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve driven myself crazy over the years over Kay. Because I\u2019ve deluded myself in a way, because my brain seems to think that if I think of him in a certain way, I must obviously be thought of in the same way by him. But that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nMy greatest fear is that if I put myself out there and get rejected, that Kay will fade from my life and think differently of me. While I want to be with him more than anything, I\u2019d rather have him in my life as a friend and from afar rather than not at all. He\u2019d be totally nice about it, I know, because that\u2019s the kind of person he is. But I don\u2019t think I could face it.\n\nBut that\u2019s life I guess.\n\nI\u2019ll update this if anything transpires.\n\nThanks for reading.", "title": "I\u2019ve been pining over the same guy for years, and I\u2019m willing the universe to help me out."}, {"created_utc": 1585972843, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fumzqw/songs_that_sound_like_love_feels/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "You know how some songs just sound like \u201clove\u201d?

So indulge me a prologue if you will.\n\n# Pretext\n\nThe Young Marines is a youth organization for boys and girls ages 8-18. It is not a reform school or any kind of disciplinary organization. But rather, it strives to imbue youth with soft skills and a sense of self confidences to work in tandem with a conventional education to better form a well rounded person. The Young Marines uses the ethics, principles and guidance of the United States Marine Corps to do this. I joined the program when I was 11 years old and spent 8 years in the organization. As you promote in the program, you are required to attend three leadership schools of ascending importance: Junior, Senior and Advanced Leadership School. these are national academies that host hundreds of students from across the country.\n\nThe program is entirely youth lead. Registered adults are on site to ensure safety, but the entirety of the planning, coordination and execution of training is conducted by Young Marines. The leadership academies are presided over by a cadre of high ranking Young Marines chosen by the CEO of the organization. \n\nEach year, a Young Marine of the Year is selected to serve as the representative of the organization. The process for this selection will be detailed below; but this Young Marines duties and responsibilities are plentiful. \n\n# Authors Note\n\nThe following story details my last 18 months in the program and how I met the first (and so far only) woman I have ever told I loved. The ramifications of this encounter are still felt on me today and I will discuss the reason for this post at the end. All events are true to my recollection. It is important to note that events will be described from my point of view and thus are subject to personal bias. I do not wish to portray anyone in a negative light and cast judgement on them. I have changed the names of the people involved to preserve anonymity.\n\n# Finally, We Begin\n\nIn the summer of 2012, I was a Young Marine Staff Sergeant, attending Senior Leadership School in Fort Pickett Virginia. This period is not particularly noteworthy aside from it being the first time I met her: Young Marine Sergeant Major Walker. Young Marine Sergeant Major (hereto abbreviated as YM/SgtMaj) was the highest attainable rank in the Young Marines, YM/SgtMaj Walker had a distinguished Young Marine career and was serving as academy Sergeant Major - which is to say, she was in charge of the entire school. She was a powerful, inspiring person. I was much too preoccupied with my own business to take much note of her. I had my own aspirations and objectives to accomplish. The stories of Senior Leadership School are beyond the scope of this story, so for now we will move ahead.\n\nThe following year I returned to Fort Pickett to attend Advanced Leadership School. This is the highest level school offered by the Young Marines and was seen as very prestigious - only 50 Young Marines were admitted to the school. At this point I was a Young Marine Gunnery Sergeant. YM/SgtMaj Walker returned, but not as the academy Sergeant Major, this time she was an honored guest, as are all Young Marines of the Year. YM/SgtMaj Walker was elected as the 2013/2014 National Young Marine of the Year (NYMOY). One of her duties including attending the leadership academies as a guest, to inspire and motivate the students. \n\nAdvanced Leadership School (ALS) was a notable time for a number of reasons:\n\n1) I met Kyle Thompson there. Kyle was a Young Marine Master Sergeant from Miami, FL. He and I would become great friends. And to this day, Kyle remains my best friend.\n\n2) I distinguished myself amongst the national elite. While at ALS, I was able to make a favorable impression among the national staff who were in attendance. The \"ALS Top Ten\" is a colloquium to describe the top ten graduates of Advanced Leadership School. Those who graduate in the top 10 of their class are invited to attend the National Leadership Symposium that is held in Washington DC every Fall. I graduated second in my class. Kyle graduated first.\n\nSo now we skip ahead a few months to October of 2013. I was in Washington DC for the Symposium: a panel of hand selected Young Marines are locked in a hotel conference room for three days and tasked with coming up with ideas that would better the program. They create a presentation and present it directly to the CEO of the Young Marines. If he likes it, the changes will be enacted on the spot. The Symposium is composed of the ALS Top Ten, the current National Young Marine of the Year and the other five Division Young Marines of the Year, as well as anyone else the CEO deems fit to invite. \n\nHere, we must introduce Young Marine Sergeant Major Donald Royce. YM/SgtMaj Royce was the Division 6 Young Marine of the Year (DYMOY): my division. He and I had been friends for several years and because of his status as a DYMOY, he was close friends with YM/SgtMaj Walker. While at the Symposium, all of us became very close. We debated, discussed and argued for several days until we agreed on the changes we wanted to make. YM/SgtMaj Walker made it a point to get to know everyone in attendance and there was when this woman who had previously only been a far off deity to me had become more of a person. I grew to know her sense of humor, her convictions, her principles. She likewise was glad to see some of her own friends. The DYMOY's form a tight bond and given they are from all different parts of the country, they only get the chance to see each other once every couple months. YM/SgtMaj Walker told YM/SgtMaj Royce that she wanted to come out and visit his unit, to which he responded \"No my unit sucks, let's go visit Wheeler's (that's me) unit instead\"\n\nSo a couple weeks later the two of them came to my unit to visit. This was a big deal for us. Whenever a unit has the chance to host a YMOY they generally put on a show, to have a DYMOY and the NYMOY at the same time was a big deal. I also knew that at this point in my career, I could make a serious run at YMOY myself, so I figured it'd help to have friends in high places. YM/SgtMaj Walker stayed with me at my house. She slept in my room while I grabbed the couch. This is not particularly important aside from understanding that we became closer the more time we spent together. At this time, I would have called YM/SgtMaj my friend.\n\n# My Ascension\n\nSo around November of 2013 it was time for the Young Marine of the Year process to start. Every Fall, each of the more than 300 units across the country elect a Young Marine to serve as the Young Marine of the Year for their unit. This YM serves as the ambassador and spokesperson for their unit on higher levels of debate. I had been elected YMOY of my unit several times in the past but never got above that level. I figured now - having graduated ALS second in my class and attended the Symposium, I had a good shot to make it. I was chosen as my unit YMOY, and was quickly selected as the North Oregon Battalion YMOY. A few weeks later, I was chosen as the Northwest Regiment YMOY and on December 31st, 2013, as I was walking out of my house towards my car, I got a phone call from YM/SgtMaj Royce. he said \"I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you're my friend and I wanted you to hear it from me, you've been selected as the Division 6 Young Marine of the Year.\" The next day I got a phone call from the CEO confirming (I had to pretend to be surprised). \n\nDivision Young Marine of the Year is a big deal because there are only 6 divisions in the country. At this point, I was in charge of more than 2,000 YM's spread across 8 states. Additionally, it is from this pool of 6 DYMOY's the next NYMOY will be selected. Whereas the process to this point had taken several weeks, DYMOY's undergo a 6 month evaluation process. They are observed and evaluated on how well they run their division. They are given a travel budget that allows them to fly to different places within their division to speak with YM's and represent the program. I was meritoriously promoted to YM/SgtMaj on February 2nd, 2014. \n\n\\*Kyle Thompson, my best friend from ALS and the best YM I had ever met, was *not* selected as the D3 YMOY because of BS politics between him and his Regimental Commander. It was a bit of a scandal that beyond our story here.\n\nAnother part of the evaluation process is the Reunion of Honor trip. Each year, ten YM's are chosen to go to Guam with WWII veterans. They tour various sites of the Pacific Theatre of WWII and honor the heroes who fought. The climax of the trip is a privately chartered plane to Iwo Jima where a Reunion of Honor ceremony is held between the United States and Japanese military to celebrate how far our countries have come since then. It is far and away the best experience the Young Marines has to offer. The ten participants are the 6 DYMOY's, the current NYMOY (yes, that means the NYMOY gets to go twice. Once as a DYMOY, then the next year as the NYMOY), the two Jimmy Trimble Scholarship winners and the Directors Choice, a YM who distinguishes themselves so much that the CEO hand picks them to come along. Kyle was chosen to attend the trip he should have been on as a DYMOY.\n\n# Guam\n\nWe went to Guam in March of 2014. This was a big moment for me. Both personally and professionally. Not only was this an island paradise unlike any other, but my friendship with YM/SgtMaj Walker became more of a flame. The tone of the Guam trip was much more relaxed than any other. We were the ten highest ranking YM's in the program, we were all 17 or 18 years old and we were on an island. There was no curfew, no rules besides \"Be at breakfast at 0700\". We were trusted to behave maturely and respectfully - and we did. We spent our evenings walking the streets, taking in the culture, exploring caves and meeting locals. We'd spend our nights sitting on the beach and talking. \n\nI remember one night Walker and I were sitting alone poolside in the humid night air. Somehow we got to talking about dating. I had known that she had a boyfriend - the 2011 D6 YMOY - so I presumed to keep my distance. But she casually dropped that she had broken up with him a few weeks back. This was the first I had heard of it. By this point, I had a huge crush on her. Aside from her beauty, she carried herself with a confidence you simply don't find in an 18 year old. Still, this woman was the National Young Marine of the Year. When I met her she was the Sergeant Major of the academy I was a student at. I couldn't make a move. No. I was being evaluated, if I screw up here, I can kiss my chances at NYMOY goodbye. So I did nothing. I kept my distance. But there was a look, something in her eyes that said \"I know\". \n\nThe trip went on, we flew to Iwo Jima - had a whole other adventure there - and eventually went home. I remember on the flight from Guam to Honolulu, Walker asked the woman next to me if she would mind trading seats. Her and I sat together on the flight home. She made me watch Pitch Perfect (ugh) and she asked if I had any trips coming up. I did, I had made arrangement to travel to Los Angeles and visit a local unit just the week after we got back from Guam. Walker said she wouldn't mind coming along if I'd let her. Who am I to refuse the NYMOY? So I said she'd be welcomed. After the movie, she asked if she could sleep on my shoulder because the window is too rough. By the end of that 7 hour flight my shoulder was numb to the touch, but I would have spent another 7 hours like that with a smile on my face. \n\nOnce in Hawaii, we all got on different flights to take us home. I gave heartfelt goodbye to my friend Kyle and told the wished the others good luck in their duties. Then we went our separate ways.\n\n# Los Angeles\n\nJust a couple weeks later, I was in Los Angeles to visit a unit. Walker flew out from Kentucky to meet me and word had also gotten to YM/SgtMaj Bethany, the California Regimental YMOY. She wanted to tag along with us. So this unit really pulled out all the stops as they hosted the Regimental, Division and National YMOY all in the same day. Walker and I stayed in the same hotel, her room was directly above mine. We both arrive in LA on a Friday, YM/SgtMaj Bethany was driving down from Sacramento and wouldn't get in until Saturday afternoon. So Walker and I had the day to ourselves. \n\nWe got some dinner, walked around the area and eventually went back to her room to watch some TV. We were sitting on her bed watching Ghost Hunters. I remember my mind racing. I knew that there was some kind of mutual attraction, I knew it when she looked at me at the pool. I knew it when we sat together on the plane. But I was just too scared. I sat motionless on that bed next to her. Until eventually she turned to me and said \"so are we going to watch this show, or are you going to kiss me?\" \n\nThe next day we were visiting the unit, so we put on our best clothes and polished our rings and were picked up by one of their registered adults early in the morning. We spent the day talking to their YM's about our time in the program and what kind of opportunities awaited them later on in their careers. YM/SgtMaj Bethany arrived later in the day and gave a speech of her own. We took pictures with the YM's and answered their questions. When we would take group pictures, Walker would lightly run her finger up my back, or I would hold her tight around the waist. The forbidden aspect of the whole thing made it that much more fun and exciting.\n\nOne of the parents told us that her husband worked at Disneyland and she could get us in if we wanted, so later that day Walker, Bethany, a local YM and I spent the evening in Disneyland using her fathers employee pass to get ahead in the lines. Once we got back to the hotel, I had to sneak out of my room - as Bethany was in the adjoining one - and meet Walker upstairs in her own. \n\nThe next day we rejoined the local YM unit to attend a formula 1 race. At the time, the Young Marines sponsored an F1 driver and he was participating in the race. He gave us all great seats and granted us access behind the scenes to the cars and drivers. Afterward, Bethany hit the road back to Sacramento and Walker and I had the rest of the day to ourselves. On Monday we went to the airport together, spent a few more hours in each others companies and went our separate ways. I had another trip planned to Arizona a few weeks later that she wanted to tag along on, but she had to cancel because YM/SgtMaj Royce was retiring out of the program that same weekend and she wanted to be there.\n\n# Washington DC\n\nI spent the next two months traveling around my division, spending each weekend in a different state talking to different YM units. Walker and I spoke daily. Finally in June of 2014, we met again in Washington DC for the Adult Leaders Conference. \n\nThis is where the National Young Marine of the Year would be chosen. The 6 DYMOY's - in addition to the 6 months of evaluation they had undergone - were sat up on stage in front of the entire convention and one by one asked to answer questions. We spent the majority of the week mingling with guests and traveling around the city, trying not to think about what would happen at the end. Finally, we each sat in front of a panel consisting of the 6 Division Commanders, the NYMOY, and the CEO of the organization. Each of them asked us one question, and they had to ask the same question to each DYMOY. We drew straws to determine which order we would go in. \n\nKyle Thompson, my best friend and rightful D3 YMOY, was invited to join the conference by national HQ. This is unusual because typically the only YM's at the Adult Leaders Conference were the DYMOY's, but such was the reputation of YM/SgtMaj Thompson.\n\nKyle and I hadn't seen each other since Guam so we were ecstatic to be reunited. But this is also where the first bit of bad news was delivered. Kyle told me that he knew Walker and I had been seeing each other for the past couple months... and that he had been as well.\n\nHe told me that one night in Guam they were talking on the balcony of her room and he kissed her. And right after she left Los Angeles she went to Miami and stayed with him for two weeks. I was shocked and saddened by the blow. Kyle told me he didn't want anyone to come between our friendship and what ensued was the both of us trying out do each others act of nobility by insisting that the other person should date Walker. We were interrupted by our duties to the conference and never really decided who won the argument. \n\nLater that day I went to Walker's room to confront her about it. She didn't deny any of it. But rather owned up in a rather apathetic tone. I guess she never meant to hide the fact she was seeing us both, but rather I just never asked. She had told Kyle of our weekend trip to Los Angeles almost as soon as she touched down in Miami. I, never being one for confrontation - and still wildly under her spell of authority and power, couldn't resist her charm. She kissed me and I couldn't help myself. What felt like hours were merely minutes passed and a knock came at the door. I remember the way she smiled when she heard it. It was like she was scared but excited at the same time. She looked through the peep hole and panicked. Throwing my clothes at me she told me to get dressed fast. She went into the bathroom and flushed the toilet which bought me enough time to get dressed. She opened the door and Kyle was standing there.\n\nHe asked her if she just used the bathroom while I was in the room. She told him that she just killed a spider with a wad of toilet paper and flushed it down (she was really smart and very quick on her feet). He asked if he could speak with her so I excused myself and met up with the other DYMOY's to try and take my mind off of things. Kyle told me that the two of them had it out. Unlike me, he isn't afraid of confrontation. Whether their bloodletting ended the same way ours did I did not know, and did not ask.\n\nThe days went on. I sat on my panel, I sat in front of the board and when all was said and done, I was elected the 2014/2015 National Young Marine of the Year. Standing on that stage, lights shining, people cheering, knowing that I had summited the proverbial Mt. Everest of the Young Marines program; the feeling... wasn't nearly as exciting as I had imagined it.\n\nI was determined to live up to the title. I remember a passage in the Esprit magazine (the YM magazine that publishes quarterly) written by YM/SgtMaj Walker where she talked about the role of NYMOY. She said that there exist no guidelines for serving as NYMOY. In none of the texts or doctrines that order the program does it detail the duties and responsibilities of the NYMOY. As such, the role is freshly defined each year. With each succession the role changes and morphs into what that YM wants from it. Walker was widely regarded as the best YMOY ever to that point, and she challenged me to do better. I could write an entire novel detailing my tenure as NYMOY, but such stories are beyond our scope. Needless to say I made the decision to end things with Walker so I could start fresh as the NYMOY. The first trip I had to go on as NYMOY: Kentucky, for the retirement of YM/SgtMaj Walker.\n\n# Kentucky\n\nI arrived in Kentucky just five days later. I took the red eye in and arrived sometime in the early morning. I had asked Walker if I needed to get a hotel or if I could stay at her place; she told me to get a hotel. I was upset at this because when she had come out to visit my unit I let her stay in my house. Plus I went to Senior Leadership School with her brother and wanted to see him again. Nonetheless, she picked me up from the airport, took me to drop off my bags and showed me around the town. We had been seeing each other for several months but I was finally seeing where she was from. I met her mother and saw her home. But Walker was very careful to keep conversation light. She would frequently answer questions directed at her mother and insisted we do stuff like watch a movie or play a board game. Eventually she told her family she wanted to show me around and introduce me to some of her friends. But when we left her home, she instead drove us to my hotel. \n\nI attended her retirement the next day. Several old friends came out. Including YM's I hadn't seen in years who had became friends with Walker in their own way. The ceremony was nice. There were slideshows and speeches and presentations. Of course no one gave a better speech than her, she couldn't have allowed that. It was heartfelt, emotional without being sappy (she never cried), funny without being self deprecating and above all inspiring. In a few months she would be attending the Coast Guard academy and her mother was very proud - must have been mentioned half a hundred times. Afterward we all went to dinner and spent the night celebrating. \n\nThe next day people began to leave for the airport but my flight offered me a travel voucher for delaying myself a few hours to the next flight. At Walker's behest, I took the delay. We spent the entirety of that time in my dark and cold hotel room. Windows shut. I remember asking her what happened with Kyle. She told me that their relationship was really just about the emotional side. That they'd just spend hours talking about things. That they didn't have the animal nature we did. \n\nThis... greatly upset me. Because I wanted a real relationship. I wanted somebody who didn't want to just lock me in a hotel room to use at their pleasure. I wanted to meet her family, to be a part of it. I asked if Kyle had met her family, she said yes. He came up a couple weeks earlier for her high school graduation. Her *High School* graduation. That's not a Young Marine activity which means the program wouldn't pay for their travel. She spent $1,500 of her own money to fly him from Miami to Kentucky and let him stay in her home with her family for a week. \n\nI was visibly shaken. I stood up and made a b line for the bathroom. I stared at myself in the mirror in a bit of self indulgent drama. I couldn't cry in front of her, she'd never allow that. But I wasn't as strong as her. I splashed water on my face and walked out, determined to let her have my wroth... which is when she made her best move yet. As I stormed out she cupped my face, pushed me against the wall, kissed me deep, looked in my eyes and said \"I love you.\"\n\nThe world dropped around me. At once all the wars and sickness and death and destruction in the world stopped. It was just her and I, the world didn't extend beyond the reach of our arms. Any kind of rage I felt turned to sweetness. The words caught in my throat and I stood there mouth ajar, eyes made of glass and blinking. So she repeated the words. \"I love you\". Until finally I smiled and said \"I love you too\".\n\nShe dropped me at the airport later where I sat for a few hours. We texted the whole time. We talked about how things would work, with her at the Coast Guard academy and me busy with NYMOY responsibilities. She gave me some big speech about how she doesn't know what will happen tomorrow, but she knows how she feels right now in this moment. The whole thing was pretty cheesy looking back but in the moment it felt raw and romantic. \n\nAnd that was the last time I saw her.\n\n# Life goes on\n\nWe kept in touch for a while after that day. But she began her summer training shortly after and thus was unable to communicate save for written letters, for which I never had an address. My responsibilities as NYMOY kept me busy. I took her challenge to usurp her and ran with it, exceeding many expectations. In the 11 months I held the title of NYMOY (the ALC the next year was held in May, much to my distain), I traveled more than 200,000 miles and visited close to 100 units. Six times over the next year I went to Miami, to visit their YM unit, of course, and to see my best friend. There is no metric to gauge NYMOY's, but at my retirement in 2015, I was told by my mother that the CEO of the organization had pulled her aside and told her that I was his favorite NYMOY. I try to be a humble person; but if I'm being honest, it feels good to at least get the better of Walker in this regard. \n\nWe actually saw each other one more time, nearly a year later. I flew to Louisville to film an episode of the Young Marines News Network, but when I got there the CEO was not around. I called him to ask where he was, only for him to exclaim he had forgotten about his flight, such is the life of a CEO. He told me to take the weekend and enjoy the city, but I assured him I was capable of helming the episode by myself. So I went to the studio the next day and Mike Tobsson - who owns the production studio we film at - told me Walker had texted him and said she was back in town (Mike Tobsson's studio had spent that last year filming a documentary about the YM's where they followed YM/SgtMaj Walker on her travels, so the two of them were friends). He wanted to invite her to the studio and I thought it would be unprofessional to decline. So the two of us filmed an impromptu \"Where are they Now\" segment. Her, I and her mother then got lunch and went our own ways. It was rather uneventful.\n\nWalker has since graduated from the Coast Guard academy, gotten a job a large tech company, got married and traveled the world. Kyle has graduated college as an engineer, has a wonderful girlfriend who he loves. I am still in college (school was never a strong suit of mine) with a focus in supply chain management. I've done some foreign travel myself but have since cut back on the fun excursions to focus entirely on school.\n\n# So, what's the point?\n\nSo, why did I just write a novella about something that happened close to five years ago? Honestly, I'm not sure. I've struggled in the dating scene for several years and just recently I hit a rough patch and began thinking about this experience again. After all this went down, I didn't tell anyone. How could I? Walker was not just the NYMOY, she was *THE* NYMOY. She was the best YM to come through the program to that point. Highly respected by YM's and adults alike. I couldn't besmirch her character. Not to mention it also reflects poorly on me. I mean, this story is just a more dramatic way of saying I slept to the top (which isn't true, I spent 7 years working my ass off to get to that point I am tremendously proud of my accomplishments. But still, it's how it would be perceived). Kyle was the only other person who knew, and we talked about it for a while. We reconciled our friendship and realized that our bond was stronger than any woman could come between. To this day he remains my best friend. We don't see each other very often since the YM's stopped paying for our travel, but that hasn't diminished our friendship one bit.\n\nI suppose I am writing this just for the sake of writing it. To get this story out there in hopes that I can let go of it. Honestly I haven't thought of Walker in quite some time, but the fact that I can still recall this story with such detail (I've left out entire conversations that I remember verbatim) has to mean that some part of me still holds to this memory. Maybe it's the saying \"twas better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\" because this was the last \"relationship\" I've been in. And despite how it may have been portrayed, we had genuinely good moments. That weekend in Los Angeles remains one of the best periods of my life. I don't know that I would necessarily change what happened either. There was heartache and sadness. But also joy and bliss. \n\nI wouldn't go as far as to say the hardship has made me a better person. I don't believe in better or lesser people; only people. What are we if not the sum of our experiences? I often tell people I want to go everywhere, see everything and meet everyone. Our experiences in life shape our characters. I am who I because of the joy, excitement, sadness, love, heartache and wistfulness Walker put me through. I wish her nothing but happiness and success in her life and know that whatever ramifications these events had on me, whether they are real, or just some means of me blaming all my insecuries on, they were for the best.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nA woman used and manipulated me and my best friend and I am who am because of it.", "title": "This is the long, sad, unconventioal and true story of my first love the effects it had on me"}, {"created_utc": 1585958756, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fujkpz/because_of_love/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "A reason that can fuel your strength and also destroy you.

I never believed in love at first sight, it was fairytale nonsense until I met her. She was taken at the time by one of my friends, and I directly told him that if they broke up I would date her. A few days later they broke up, and me being her friend at the time, was the one she ran to. We would sit and talk for hours. Sit in the middle of campus watching the stars next to a small dying firepit just talking and sharing stories about our lives. But soon we had to go.\n\nThis was summer camp, and like all dreams, this to came to a close. I was young with zero confidence and had no intention of ruining the relationship that we were building. Over the school year, we never stopped talking. Everyday texts and facetimes as kids who are in love for the first time do. Both of us had dated, we were 12, but as 12 year olds, we had never done anything serious. She was shy and quiet, well, until you got to know her,  and I was the adrenaline hungry, extroverted, sports kid who would gladly roast and fight people who got in his way. \n\nOn new years I got drunk. bad decision by already drunk adults to continually give a little kid alcohol was the best thing that happened in my life. My parents quickly sent me home after finding out what others had done and I did the natural thing: call the only person on my mind. She quickly picked up and took advantage of the situation. Played truth or dare, as long as I was the only one doing the dares and telling the truths. Earlier that year I had taken a stage makeup class so I had leftovers and dared me to do my makeup. After I finished I heard her say for the first time \"I love you shithead\" and at the time I did not understand. \n\nTime passes and we are going back to camp. I pressured her into doing a unit that was all about camping and being outdoors. One day she was complaining to me and said \"I'm going to be alone this year!!!\" and I casually asked \"friends or boyfriends?\" -\"both\" and with a quick smile and an even quicker thought I stated, \"I can change that, will you be my girlfriend?\"\n\nThe following 2 months were the best that I have ever had. Nights under the stars stealing kisses until all I wanted was to lay down in the tall grass together, running away from our friends desperately trying to find where we would go to talk and cuddle each night, and every day going everywhere, connected, her hand in mine.\n\n We broke up after that summer, 5 months after because I had started going to school 1256 miles away from her house. She tried dating many people but not a single relationship seemed to work out, and every time she would come crying to me and we would talk, over the phone, staring at the stars.\n\nHere I am 5 years after I asked her out and she is moving away. She is moving 1214.2 miles away. I came home from school and before I even set my bags down I went to her house. I don't need to say what happened but I love her, and she loves me. I am scared, but hopeful, and I know that I will be loyal, no matter the time, no matter the distance, because even when we were not together, she has been the only girl I have dated in the past six years. \n\nIf you find this, Brooke, you mean more to me than anything. I fell for you harder than the shooting star that passed over our heads during our first kiss. I will never forget, and I will say this, and mean it, I love you.

(which was randomly our favorite show to watch when we were like, 12), and coming to love and accept himself as an openly gay man in an environment where it was hardly celebrated or even tolerated. He lived through a man he really loved abruptly deciding to leave him after witnessing his first clonic tonic seizure because \u201cit was too scary and I don\u2019t think I can deal with constantly stressing about things like that,\u201d and while he\u2019ll never work in an operating room like his childhood crush Dr. George Clooney, he ended up becoming a mathematician instead and is completely in love with the field.\n\nThese are all things that contribute to how much I admire my brother, but the most special part about him, I think, is how little of himself he\u2019s allowed all the trauma he\u2019s endured to take away from him. Of anyone I know, he\u2019s the person I\u2019d give a free pass to have become bitter and jaded, but somehow he hasn\u2019t.

I'm falling in love online (again) but it is absolutely new and full of feelings I've never felt before.\n\nI'm a child of the first Internet age, met my ex online in '98, married, had kids etc.  Was before that no stranger to online relationships and remote connections. Divorced 2015.\n\nHere comes new love and it is weeeeeird. It makes me question my sanity.\n\nThis may be relevant: I am of indigenous stock and both of my bloodlines have several 'gifted' people and ancestors that were burned and hounded for witchcraft. I've cheated death with the help of unconventional methods and alternative medicine, and multiple doctors call me a medical miracle.  \nI have had several premeniciouns in my life that have told me how major life events would take place and turn out, and my visions have been correct so far.   \n\n\nBack to the love story.\n\nNow I've '*known*' for a while that this professional I follow on Twitter could be the man for me. I don't know how I knew we would have history together, I presumed this was how stalkers '*just know*' that their target is supposedly 'meant for them'. \n\nI'm not a stalker and **never** have been, if anything I'm the first one to disappear at the first sign of lack of interest by the other person. I would NEVER want to pursue a person that wasn't interested. I'm a proud hot woman. \n\nBut I somehow just *knew* this man and I would hit it off. \n\nRecently I shared an academic article with him and we started talking privately on Twitter.  Slowly but surely the convo rolled out of the station....\n\n... and what a ride this has become. I *feel him* through the ether and can I feel his mood, I know when he is about to contact me, his thoughts of me and hell I could even feel how he fantasized about us together. In the sense that I know the positions and settings he prefers.\n\nThis is scaring the hell out of me because I am worried that this is some sort of insanity.\n\nI have no mental illness asides from ADHD (I consider it a gift, not a curse).

I'm a documentarian working on a project titled \"Love in the time of Corona.\" The short film seeks to examine quarantine and the Corona virus' impact on relationships through remote filming. If anyone has a story they would be willing to share, I'd love to set up an initial off-the record call and discuss the project more in-depth as well as ways you might be able to participate. Below is a brief description of the project:\n\n**THE PROJECT:**\n\n\"Love in the Time of Corona\u201d will be a short form documentary, examining how COVID-19 quarantines are affecting love and relationships around the world. The film will follow several subjects in various stages of quarantine dating--whether swiping on the apps, zoom meeting for the first time, or navigating a relationship in close quarters--or from afar. Dating always raises the deep questions of who we are, where we come from, what we desire, and how we integrate others into our lives-- and in quarantine these issues are only heightened. Ultimately, through the lens of love, we hope to examine the ways quarantine is changing our definitions of ourselves.\n\n**WHAT WE\u2019RE ASKING OF YOU:**\n\nWe\u2019re looking for people of all ages who are willing to share their quarantine love experiences. We want to be there for the dates, feel your anticipation before you \u201cmeet,\u201d and debrief with you afterwards. If you\u2019re currently in a relationship we want to see how quarantine is affecting your daily life--through video diaries, and possibly time-lapse recordings. We\u2019ll send you some filming instructions and a how-to guide to make the process as easy as possible.\n\n**CONTACT:**\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in participating please email [kuhn.lauraj@gmail.com](mailto:kuhn.lauraj@gmail.com). And feel free to pass this along to anyone who might be interested and share widely on social media!\n\n**FILMMAKERS:**\n\n*Love in the Time of Corona* is the brainchild of documentary filmmakers Joe Beshenkovsky and James Smith.

Weed, beer, nothing too crazy... \n\nLong story short, it didn\u2019t work out and I ended up having a great resentment towards her. \n\nCaught her selling herself to some rich old dude...\n\nWe would randomly sleep with one another still. Ended up having a child. \n\nNow she\u2019s good and we share custody of our son 50/50 but I thought I didn\u2019t see her in that light anymore and I sure as shit didn\u2019t feel that love anymore. I see her as the mother of my child and that\u2019s it. \n\nIt\u2019s been years. I\u2019ve moved on several times. So has she. \n\nI had a dream two days ago where her and I were in her old room where she grew up. We were together in the dream. Not sex or anything perverted but just feeling each other. Kissing, holding one another and I felt that intense love again. Lasted a little bit after I woke up too. Then reality sunk in... \n\nAppreciate it when you find that love.

The word \u201clove\u201d itself has changed because of new generations. Tonight I will be sharing my thoughts on what love really is. \n\n1. Love doesn\u2019t mean someone who texts you ONLY at night because he/she is bored and wants someone to talk to. Love is when throughout the day he/she texts, calls or video chat to see how you\u2019re doing. It doesn\u2019t have to last for hours. \n\n2. When you think of the person you love and having thoughts of losing him/her is incredibly painful. Even just a thought it can make you tear up. That\u2019s what love is, you\u2019re afraid for what may go wrong.\n\n3. Believe it or not, love is to accept. Accepting your flaws, mistakes and accidents you make have caused. When you are blinded by LOVE and you just can\u2019t even notice the flaws. \n\n4. Love is for you to keep. I know people always say that love is to let go but really do you think it is? No matter how much you love a person shouldn\u2019t you do everything you can to keep it instead of letting go. I know some situations are just difficult but if you and someone truly love each other why not giving it a shot? \n\nWhat is love for you?", "title": "what is love for you?"}, {"created_utc": 1587533698, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/g5vg0s/the_love_of_my_very_short_life/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "he\u2019s far away from me right now. i love him.

I had moved to a new city, left behind my closest friends and I was going through a hard heartbreak. The matters of the heart are so obstinate, aren\u2019t they? The pure denial we live in to convince our ego that we have been wronged and if we could just convince the other person to see our perspective, everything would be alright again.\n\nI considered myself lucky that I had gone through much of my teen life without any rough breakups. Until now, I was always in the driver\u2019s seat and I was in control of my emotions most of the time. However now, I didn\u2019t enjoy this sense of helplessness at all. Tired of feeling like this I decided to take matters into my own hands and turned to google for some answers. My search queries gradually kept changing and after 3 hours of \u201cresearch\u201d I had gone from typing \u201cHow to get over someone\u201d to \u201cHow to get closure\u201d to \u201cHow to attract a specific person\u201d into my search engine. (I know its pathetic, but cut me some slack will you. I think I\u2019m allowed one impulsive mistake).\n\n And that was when I ended up on a blog that explained how you could attract anything you want (In my sad case, a specific person) using the Law of Attraction. \n\n So that\u2019s a little background story explaining my first touch with LOA. \n\nIt's 21st April, 2020 today and trust me I can't be more grateful about the day when I first read about Law of Attraction. It has really changed my life. Today I am all over that heartbreak, in fact, i have an amazing girlfriend who is exactly like whom I described in my affirmations. Another proof of how my manifestation came true. And also I am studying in the postgraduation college I always dreamt of. And have landed a job with a salary which is exactly what i had put in my affirmations a year back.\n\n It's really just so magical, isn't it?\n\nBut it's certainly difficult to start at first. Right? So i thought why not write it down and help others achieve thier own goals.\n\nSo based on my experiences, I\u2019m going to give you a **4 week guide** to help you begin practicing the Law of Attraction. \n\n [https://pradaopinion.in/a-beginners-guide-to-the-law-of-attraction/](https://pradaopinion.in/a-beginners-guide-to-the-law-of-attraction/) \n\nLet me know what you think about it.", "title": "Using the law of 'Attraction' to 'get over a breakup'.

He works nights, but if I ever had a hard night cause of my family, he'd offer to come home early from work because he wanted to make me feel better.

We both knew I was going to be leaving for college soon, and I'd be far away. We decided to pursue each other anyway. Waking up beside him everyday was so amazing. If I got sick, he would take care of me. If he didnt get enough sleep, I would drive him to work so he would be safe. We made new couple friends, went somewhere together every week, and we would keep calling each other husband and wife cause that's practically what we see ourselves as now.\n\nLeaving was hard.

He even made me cookie dough once. He literally just does so many amazing things. Not to mention, I love it when I do amazing things for him too! Seeing that smile is the best. \n\nAfter I'm done with college we plan to move in together in a different state and live together again. I cant wait for that day.

I never noticed him at first; he isn't really extremely attractive or attention-commanding . He was the complete opposite of \"my type\". We worked together at a restaurant and would never talk. Until one day we did, and we eventually became friends. But I started feeling something I haven't felt about someone in a really long time. I thought he might feel the same. He would always do small things like helping me with my job (which he would never do before), laughing at my shitty jokes, remembering random things I had told him, waving to me at school, and playing tic tac toe with me during work. Just always being by my side. I would tell him things, and he would remember them months later, and then pretend he didn't know what he was saying,\n\nBut then I told him how I felt when I was drunk, and he responded differently than I thought he would. And then proceeded to treat me like he still cared afterwards, which confused the hell out of me. I have no idea what to think. \n\nI probably imagined the way he looked at me and that really kills me, because I thought this time with him things were different.

I just wish that person was him. \n\nThis guy; he's so caring and nice and genuinely good. This is like the stupidest anecdote ever, but love makes you stupid so here goes.

My other coworker asked me why my hand was covered in words. And he was standing there next to us, and he said, \"She always writes on her hands.\" Then he smiled. \n\nGod I just want to be with him forever.

It didn't even really make much sense, but for some reason she liked it. We introduced ourselves, she told me she was in my country because she was studying abroad, and that she comes from a pretty far nation. At first the conversation wasn't that different from the ones I already had with other girls, but then she said she liked how I reason over things. It was a simple compliment, but something about it got me a bit more interested in knowing her better.\n\nAfter some days of talking she asked me if I'd like to move the conversation to Instagram.\n\nHonestly, I wasn't very keen on the idea, based on my experience my interest doesn't last longer that a few days and I didn't want another dead conversation in my DMs since I knew I didn't want to take things to a relevant level. At the same time, though, I didn't really feel bored out from her already, and it wouldn't have cost me anything to just add her there, so the conversation continued on Instagram.\n\nWe kept talking, and honestly I don't even remember about what, but eventually after another couple of days, I asked her for her number and our conversation moved from Instagram to WhatsApp.\n\nIt was clear by now that we had a lot of things in common, but we also liked to discuss about things we didn't fully agree over, understanding each other's point of view at the end of the talk.\n\nI'm not used to opening up, but the more we talked, the more I realized she really understood me, and I guess it was the same for her too, because in just a few days we started getting our talks to a really, really deep level.\n\nI started to feel something for her.\n\nEveryday we ended up talking up until 5 am, because none of us wanted to go to sleep if instead we could talk to each other. \n\nOne night eventually we ended up talking about how she might have to go back to her home country. It saddened the both of us, but it also lead to us expressing our feelings for each other somehow. We understood that the person we were both writing to was not to take for given, and I knew that finding someone like her again wouldn't be easy.\n\nI know what you might think: \"come on, you've known each other for days, not even months,\u00a0not even in person\u00a0, and you talk about feelings?\"\n\nIt felt dumb to us too, but saying that there was nothing between each other would have been just as dumb, if not more.\n\nIn just a matter of days those feelings got stronger and stronger, reaching a level none of us wanted to admit. We just kept alluding at how dumb it was feeling such things for someone we haven't even met, but we never said it out loud.\n\nWe started talking and dreaming about the things we'd do if we were together, the places I'd show her if she came to my city, and the breakfasts she'd prepare for me in the morning when she'd stay at my place. \nWe talked about how we'd love to wake up next to each other, and we started giving each other nicknames.\n\nWe dreamt of how it would be to be together.\n\nOther days passed and now it's been a little less than a month since the fist text she sent me on that app, but there was still not even the slightest sign of boredom, instead everytime we talked to each other it felt like the first time.\n\nEveryday, somehow, we still ended up saying good night very late at night.\n\nThen she told me that in the next few days she'd receive a letter about whether or not she'd be sent back to her home country.\n\nWe knew this would happen, but we just didn't want to mention it too much up until then. Now we had to though.\n\nWe had a real talk about the future, no dreams now.\n\nShe asked me what did I think would happen, I told her that probably I wouldn't be allowed to leave the country up until the next year, and even if I could, right now I'm unemployed because of the Covid-19 and I'm currently broke too. She is still in school hence I'd be the one more likely to reach up to her. \nIt was a painfully cold talk, expecially after those wonderful, sweet and cheesy dreams.\n\nSo there we were, wondering what we were, and what we'd be.\n\nShe asked me if we'd be together.\n\nI wanted to tell her \"we will\", from the bottom of my heart, but I know that a promise unkept is worse than a bitter truth.\n\nI told her \"I don't know\".\n\nI've never met anyone I felt so comfortable sharing my feelings and thoughts to, I knew she was precious to me, and having no power over the situation hurt me. The only time I met such a beautiful girl, a fucking pandemic blew it all over.\n\nI don't really remember how the conversation continued, but I remember a tear falling down my cheek as I typed that uncertain reply.\n\nThe next day there were no more nicknames in our texts.\n\nWe kept talking tho, and eventually those silly nicknames came back too, as well as the old cheesiness, and I felt like maybe there really was a chance we could wait.\n\nThen that day came. The day she received that mail.\n\nIt said that she'd be sent back to her country in the next 30 days. We both knew this would happen, but I guess it was still kind of a shock to officially read it.\n\nThe conversations were not the same anymore, now disagreement led to a peaceful \"see you tomorrow\" instead of a mutual understanding, and I felt like she was pushing me away a little more everyday.\n\nI understood it, so I decided I'd let her choose. I kept texting her as I used to, but now she would take hours to reply. She once told me I was the first thing that would come to her mind in the morning, now we barely talk anymore.\n\nShe has almost entirely faded away, and now this quarantine weighs more than I thought it ever could.\n\nThere was a song we liked, and I guess it suits our story perfectly, because now she'll forever be\u00a0\"the girl I haven't met\"\u00a0to me.\n\nShe filled and emptied me in less than a month, but at the same time she taught me that it actually is possible to warm up this cold heart of mine. It was brief, but I never felt those things in my life. I won't forget her.\n\nDeep down I think I hope she could read this and understand how much she meant to me. I've never been good at expressing my feelings, and maybe that's what made her slip away.\n\nTL;DR: I probably felt love for the first time and it was for a girl I'll never meet because of the coronavirus.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts and your stories too, both those with a happy ending and those with a bitter one like mine.\n\nSorry if my writing wasn't perfect but English is not my first language.", "title": "So, was it love?"}, {"created_utc": 1587439795, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/g57r1o/my_boyfriend_3/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "This is my first serious relationship.

He is helfpul to the ones around him. He tries his best to understand me and has been by my side for about 4 years now and we have *never* argued. He cares and watches out for my feelings. He is a good listener. How much more can I think of..? Whenever I think of him, I think about how it would turn out if we dated now. I think of how he is doing that day.

This is going to be a long long story as I will go in much as I can into details, I hope you will all enjoy the reading.\nAlso please forgive me for the grammar mistakes I am going to make as English is not my first language.\n\nThe story takes place in 2016, at the time I was 18 and just finished high school, I was pretty inexperienced with relationship and girls overall because I've been involved in only one relationship before. To talk more about me I have two big hobbies in my life : Photography and travelling.\nSo I took what looked like a big decision in my life at the time, I took all the money I made during High-school when I was working on weekend and during holidays and decided to travel for the whole summer before starting college, pretty classic I know haha.\nI decided to travel in south east Asia, more especially 3 countries that I've always been interested in, Cambodia, Lao and Vietnam, yeah I'm really in love with Asia haha.\nSo I booked my plane ticket, made my bagpack and went to their airport to catch my flight.\n No need to say I was terrorized, it was the first time I was travelling alone in such a distant country (I'm European) and I was afraid of finding myself completely alone and unable to interact with other peoples. \nSurprisingly everything went really well, I made friends easily and went from hostels to hostels, discovering a beautiful country and an even more wonderful night life. \nBut let's get to the point, after arround 3 weeks of travelling in Vietnam I arrive in the biggest city of the north of Vietnam : Hanoi, 1 beautiful and more \"traditional\" city compared to Saigon. \nIn this city I met 3 German girls wich who I got along really really well, we became friends and decided to travel for a bit together. This part of the story is important because it shows how much sometimes finding love is unexpected. \nSo I travel a bit with the German girls and we end up in a city called Sa PA, this city is beautiful, it's a mountain city surrounded by rice fields and its really breathtaking when the sky is clear and sunny. \nThe problem we had is that finding an hostel for 4 people at the last moment can be really hard during the touristic season, so we left Sapa and went into a small traditional village 40 min away of the city, wich in my opinion was even more beautiful, also surrounded by rice fields and a river, it was truly an heavenly vision. \nSo we arrive at the hostel, im really tired because of the trip to get there (we had arround 8 hours of bus before and iw as a bit sick) so I decide to go to sleep for a bit while the German girls go trekking, I wake up in the middle of the afternoon to an empty hostel except the owner and one person : Billie. \nBillie was a girl travelling solo, she was from Hong Kong and was the only person that was speaking English in the hostel with me, so we naturally started talking together while my friends were missing. \nLater they came back and one of the three girl hurt herself and had to be transferred to hospital to heal her wound, so the German girls left a few hours later with their friend and it was just me and Billie left together in the Hostel. \nWhen I saw her the first time I immediately fell in love with her, she had a delicate face, a stunning smile and a pinch of crazyness in her eyes that was truly irresistible. I remember sending a message to my best friend instantly saying I met the most beautiful girl ever in my life. \nAgain as we were the two only English speaker in the hostel we talked together, we talked together A LOT, the whole night actually. People always say sometimes they talk with someone and feel like they've always known each other and I always thought it was dumb, but It never felt so true with Billie. During that night I unfortunately learnt that she had a boyfriend, and that she was supposed to meet him in 2 days in Thailand. When she said that I felt some big pain in my heart  but I was also mad at myself for feeling this way for someone that I've known for less than 24 hours.\nWe kept talking about our visions of relationships, life, philosophy etc... But I was feeling there was something wrong with his boyfriend, she didn't feel happy about her relationship with him, it seemed like she was just in a relationship to not feel alone.\nBelieve me or not she received a text message from the ex girlfriend of her boyfriend (if that makes sense) saying that her boyfriend has been cheating for months with pics and videos to prove it. She bursted in tears insulting him and stuff and saying she would fly to Thailand to kill him. After crying for some long long minutes she calmed down and went to sleep without saying anything and I was just left there looking at her going away unable to cheer her up or bring any solutions.\nShe was supposed to leave in the early afternoon so I thought I would go to sleep and never see her again, I was wrong, when I woke up and to my surprise she was still there, her eyes looking empty and red from crying all her tears out.\nI tried talking with her a bit but she wasn't saying anything or even answering to me so I thought I would just leave her alone, I was about to leave the hostel to walk arround and enjoy the beautiful sight, when I was about to leave she came to me and asked if she could come walk with me, obviously I said yes.\nWe walked arround silently, enjoying the view, until she started talking about all of this and ranted to me, I was happy because in my opinion talking about this is a necessary part to get over things. I made my best to cheer her up and changer her mind, the next few days were just both of us talking all the time all day and all night taking walks and enjoying our lives as much as we could.\nAt some point I could see she was not thinking about her ex boyfriend anymore she was just enjoying the moment. As we were talking we were also getting closer, hugging, touching each other faces and stuff like that, even cuddling and stuff.\nAnd then one night, when all lights were off and just the light of us smoking our cigarettes(I know that's bad dony kill me) allowed us to see each other face our faces got closer to each other and we finally kissed, honestly that was the most romantic thing that I ever experienced in my life and the most breathtaking kiss as well, the next days went by really fast and was just pure affection kissing cuddling and talking with each other, the hostel was still empty it felt like it was just the two of us in the world.\nI asked her if she could travel with me to Lao and Cambodia and she said yes and guys let me tell you the following month has been the happiest in my life until now, just pure love between two people it was truly amazing, but at some point we both had to go back to our country, and she was the first one to leave, I went with her to the airport and she fell in tears again wich broke my heart, seeing her crying was truly heartbreaking for me, she made me promess that we would see each other again before 2017 and I promessed because I was dumb and in love.\nI came back to my country a few days later, we were talking and calling each other everyday, I was already planning to see her in December so I booked my ticket for Hong Kong to spend Christmas with her. Fast forward to there I went to Hong Kong she was waiting for me at the airport, I was so happy to see her again after such a long time we hugged each other, but she didn't kiss me, a thing she would do all the time when we were travelling together, I found it suspicious but didn't overthing about it \nWhile we were going to the Airbnb I booked (she was still living with her parents at the time and I didn't wznt to be intrusive) she told me she talked with her boyfriend and got back with him a few weeks ago I was so shocked I couldn't say anything, not a single word, the girl I fell in love so hard with litterally broke my heart. I didn't say a single word until we reached my Airbnb I took my bags said Goodbye to her and never talked to her again since then. No need to say my trip in Hong Kong was shitty and I went to clubs everyday to drink in order to forget about her wich didn't work and I cried myself to sleep every night lmao.\nHere is the end of the story of me being a fucking clown and blinded by love thanks for reading.\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21", "title": "The one time I truly fell in love with someone."}, {"created_utc": 1587411281, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/g4zhkf/quarantine_has_given_me_doubts_suddenly/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 2, "selftext": "Last year, I had a crush on this person and we have gotten closer and we both found out that we both like each other.

It was a pretty boring job overall, but I got to meet some great people. Before long, I had worked my way up to shift lead, which is basically a semi-managerial position, and got moved to another store down the street. I was pretty nervous about starting over in terms of work friends. \n\nFortunately, everyone at the other store was really chill, and we all got to become friends in a short time. That\u2019s when I first met her. She was working to be a shift lead at that store, and we got along quickly. We made jokes at each other whenever we worked together, and talked until we finished closing the store at night. It didn\u2019t take me long at all for me to get a crush on her. She was just a really chill person who laughed at my shitty jokes. Soon, I worked up enough courage to ask her out, and we had a great time.\n\nOn the second date, we went back to my place and smoked some weed. Before long, we were cuddling on my couch watching some show on Netflix. Before I knew what was happening, I kissed her, and she kissed me back. We kept doing this with the occasional break to breathe and look wordlessly at each other. I drove her home in silence, but we held hands the entire way to her house.\n\nWe texted each other the entire next day, trying to figure out what each other wanted. Problem was, I was leaving for college in a few days, and we had just decided to be a thing. We both agreed to try long distance, and talk often.\n\nSo, I left, and we talked all day every day. Soon it was my birthday, and she drove all the way from her house to my college town, which is almost 4 hours away. We got a hotel, and I lost my virginity to her that night. It was also a month into our relationship and I said I loved her that same night.\n\nEverything is great for 2 months. Even, she ended up being distant with me. We talked less frequently and I became the one to initiate conversation. When this happened, it crushed my self-esteem because I felt like somehow me not being there was why she was being distant.\n\nIn January of this year, I was in my dorm drinking with my friends. She texted me, and broke up with me that night. She had emotional problems (should have said that earlier my b), and felt like she didn\u2019t want to drag me down with her. It quite literally broke my heart, and that night was the first time in 19 years that I\u2019ve cried over a girl. She was the first person I\u2019d ever fallen in love with, and we jokingly talked about marriage, but I didn\u2019t think it was a joke in my mind. I even told her that whatever happened happens when she brought up staying together that long.\n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s June and I\u2019m still thinking about her.

I'm a black girl, so this is kinda rare. Let me tell you my story. Grab some snacks, this might be a bit long, lol. If you ever want more stories from me, lemme know! I love writing them. So, once upon a time, last year, I was looking at a class list before the day of school (I'm hoping he'll see this and get the hint). Anyway, I realize there's a guy named Dylan. I don't really know him that well and I find that a bit strange seeing as I know mostly everyone in my grade. I know a few not-so-great-friends that I had in the past that dated him, he was THAT kinda guy. But I realized he wasn't really hanging out with the group of douchebags anymore, but whatever. I shrugged my shoulders and moved on. Come the next day, I come to school and realize his locker is on the left of mine. Again, whatever. I didn't really say anything to him 'cause I was talking to the new kids and stuffing my stuff in a new locker. Anyway, I go into class and realize that his assigned desk is right beside mine. A few of my friends from an earlier grade.. another story.. he was in the class. I'm talking and laughing with him when Dylan comes up and starts talking to him along with me. Kinda awkward but whatever. Then after school, when I get on the bus, let's call the old friend Blaze, Blaze was sitting on the bus, with the friend, Blaze's cousin-Brooklyn, chatting with Dylan and I kinda joined the conversation seeing as I was close friends with Blaze and Brooklyn and we all started to have tons of fun together. So, we all sat together for about a week, talking when Brooklyn and Ben stopped showing up on the bus and it was just me and Dylan. \n\n  \nFirst thing I noticed about him- he loved memes and his eyes were wayyyy too brown. He was always tan seeing as his family traveled a lot and basically used to live in Egypt. So, this guy's on my bus, beside my locker, and beside my desk all the time in class due to our last names. I started to get close to him and we talked everyday. All of a sudden one of my friends (uhm) Talle started to ship us together, and it soon caught on and EVERYONE was shipping us. In the beginning, it was annoying and I thought we were just friends. But in the middle of class, he'd tap me from behind or beside me and whisper stuff to me and make me laugh and he's steal my things a lot just to watch me get annoyed even though I secretly loved it. One day, I was walking to our lockers with him and I think we were arguing when he grabbed my pencil out of my hands and started to dance around with it so I couldn't get it. I was laughing and I was like 'Give it bacckkkkkk', and everyone was looking at us and we were both laughing super hard when I leaned in too close and he was just STARING at me with the Kool-Aid brown eyes. Bruhhhhhh. My heart did a flip-flop, somersault, six backflips, aerio cartwheel, and a handstand forward roll to finish it off. His smile kinda faded also. I reached in further and snatched it away, trying to laugh it off, but we both knew something was different this time. That night, to go to sleep, I was thinking about his beautiful eyes when I realized 'Uhm, since when did I start daydreaming about him-?!' Boom, I realized I liked the dork and I was hooked.

I want you to know that yes- I want to travel the world, I want to look at the ocean, and watch the sunset, I want to go on an adventure, I want to laugh, I want to scream in happiness, I want to watch the stars, I want to eat food and have challenges with you, I want you to teach me how to play the games you like, I want to be dizzy with so much love that I am staggering with affection.. for you. I want you to be my King and I your Queen and I want us to rule the world together. I know this is really cheesy, writing down my love for you on a Reddit post, but you'll just have to deal with the kisses when I finally find you, haha. I'm a hopeless romantic, if you couldn't tell. I want to treat you like the special person you are.. especially if you aren't being loved by anyone else. I am very sure that this will make its way to you when you need it the most and I hope you're just as much of a hopeless romantic because I don't want you think I'm crazy, lol. I'll accept you for your flaws and that's that. I'll do it because I know you'll accept me for me too. And, no, I'm not a white girl, and if you thought I was, change your mind now, hahahaha. I have to head off now, but hopefully this put a smile on your face? See you soon.

Then settle down for a few moments on this isolated bench in the darkness of a flashing lamp post to watch the people passing by, marching and waving before our dazzled eyes. These fleeting encounters that nourish our soul with ephemeral memories, tinged with a certain sublimated nostalgia, transforming these harmless moments into eternal moments.\n\nI can already see us philosophizing about everything, about nothing, about life, about the future, about yesterday, and about fickle subjects, under the benevolent gaze of the moon, illuminating the sky with its divine pallor.

Take the time to contemplate each line drawing her angelic face, her cheeks, her smile, her gaze. To lose oneself in the depths of her sparkling golden pupils. To be intoxicated by her sweet perfume and her long saffron-coloured hair, caressed by the light breath of the wind. To take a photograph of this timeless moment and engrave it forever in my memory.\n\nAnd, in this euphoric enthusiasm, I imagine us walking along the banks of the river that flows silently, reflecting like a celestial mirror the lights of the thousand-year-old buildings next to the banks of the docks. Walking along the water, in a silent din, both gentle and magical. To make this night an endless wandering, and to stay by her side for eternity, without there ever being a tomorrow.

It was odd because it didn\u2019t feel like he was interested, but it also didn\u2019t feel like he was uninterested. \n\nI had too much of an adrenaline rush to stop there so I asked him on a second date (my bad, I guess) and he said he was busy (no offer for another day). It concluded his feelings, but to be sure, I just opened up to him that I asked him out as more than a friend. \n\nHe confessed that he suspected it, and then wrote a really sweet message back saying I was beautiful and great but concluding that the age gap was too much. (I\u2019m 19). \n\nMost of my friends are much older than me, and I have always been told I am very mature for my age. I wondered what it was about me, or if it was just the number that bothered him. Or, just an excuse so I wouldn\u2019t feel as bad? \n\nI replied accepting it and thanking him for being sweet. After that, I stopped messaging him and just tried to move on. I went on a dating spree, tried to find someone that I could feel something for. I dated guys my age, and guys older, and still- I found myself comparing them to him.\n\nWe share a group of friends and not long after the rejection, we both went out with these friends. I acted as normal as I could, and I think he did too. It wasn\u2019t awkward at all. Though, he paid for my food at the end, and I tried to pay him back but he wouldn\u2019t accept it. \n\nFor months after, I just tried to move on. \n\nOne day, he messaged me inviting me out to this group of friends. I guess I was surprised because he\u2019s never been the one to invite me out with these friends. I keep telling myself he was just being friendly, but when we went out, it felt awkward and he was more quiet than usual. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t our normal group, much smaller than usual, and I found myself wondering why he had invited me. I think I started to feel angry because he just wasn\u2019t saying much. I would\u2019ve appreciated if he could at least try to make conversation, especially since I was totally not a bitch with the rejection even though it felt like I got stomped on :( \n\nIt was running through my mind that maybe part of him did feel something as I had suspected, but it\u2019s like he is always holding back. I suppose it\u2019s just wracking my head that my gut won\u2019t let go of him. \n\nEven though he rejected me, I wonder why it\u2019s so hard to just forget him. I can\u2019t figure out why the thought of him still gives me butterflies. \n\nHow do I move on? How do I settle that \u201cwhat if\u201d feeling even after he\u2019s rejected me? \n\nI just want to find peace and stop thinking about him- stop comparing him to potential partners. But, while also staying civil and able to stay in the same friend group. \n\nI don\u2019t want him to think I hate him, so I\u2019ve got him on social media now. \n\nI guess I\u2019d just like some outside perspective. I feel like I am too zoomed in on the situation. \n\nAny perspective is appreciated!

When I first saw her I was completely stunned. I had never seen anyone as gorgeous as her. She also talked about so many things that I related too, seemed a pretty interesting person. I knew I would never in my half have a chance with someone like that. I\u2019m 20 years old and have never been in a relationship, and not for lack of trying. \n\nWe used to take the same bus route to get to school and back home, and one day we found each other in the line but wouldn\u2019t say anything because we were both so socially awkward. That is, until the bus we where in crashed. If that doesn\u2019t make two people interact, I don\u2019t know what will. So we took another bus and started talking. We just had so much in common, and the rare times we interacted I could really feel a connection. Ever since that bus incident, there\u2019s been so much stuff that has brought us together, almost as if life itself wanted it to be like that.\n\nDuring the middle of our first winter break, about a year and a half ago, she randomly texted me a funny meme. That was the start of us continuously texting every single night, all night long. We would go to sleep until 3 am. We ended up going out three times during that vacation, and nothing ever seemed to go as planned. We would end up doing absolutely nothing every time, but still managed to have a great time. Nothing romantic or even physically happened as I was just too afraid to make a move, still am. Add that to the fact that she doesn\u2019t like physical contact. But I was sure there was something raging between us, I could feel it. \n\nYear two of college came and we had a weird start. She would avoid me during classes but we still texted the same way every night. I found that a little weird, but couldn\u2019t get it let to me. That was, until a few months later, when I felt pressured into trying out something, out of fear of been seen as \u201cjust a friend\u201d. I felt so nervous when I tried to tell her how I felt, only to see her treat me the coldest way possible. During the rest of that semester she would just flat out ignore me. That was until the end of it came closer. Our teacher organized a two day trip to another city for our group, and it felt like a long week. The group visited museums, plazas and just explore the city, and every time Ace found a way to start getting closer to me again. We ended up spending the second afternoon together, just doing nothing and still enjoying ourselves like we do. Despite that, things were still a bit awkward and we just didn\u2019t talk at all during the summer vacations.\n\nThere was only one day during that vacation period, in which a friend organized a small reunion. Ace was gonna be in it, along other four friends, so it really was a small thing. I arrived and everybody was already there, I greeted everyone but she kept ignoring me for some reason. Wouldn\u2019t even look at me. The day kept going and we ended up just talking again like we used to. I walked her back to her home and she did the unexpected. She hugged me and then kissed me in the cheek. I was left speechless. I didn\u2019t want to push anything so we remained without talking for the rest of that vacation.\n\nI got a job with a lecturer that requires me to travel a lot. That means that I was gonna start missing school days. When we went back to it, Ace and I were ready to get along just fine. To really become friends. People have told me that those days I miss school, she has gotten my back whenever professors ask about me. We talked in person, we casually texted while on my travels and it was overall just great. But I still felt something for her, despite trying to get over that feeling, it would just become bigger and stronger as time went by. Yet I knew not to do anything about it. Our friendship was just too perfect. \n\nWe kept texting all day long until 3 am during the winter break, and we went out plenty of times too. She even told me to invite her to a conference so she could see what I worked on. We became so close during the first few days, it really started to feel like it was slowly becoming something else. But one day she just stopped responding. We went silent for plenty of days. We would start talking again, only for her to go silent yet again for even more days. Eventually, we ended up going out once more before school started again, and had a great time as usual. By the end of the night I told her how I felt once again. And once again, I was misguided. She explained that the times she stopped responding were so \u201cI didn\u2019t get any ideas\u201d, that nothing would ever happen and that I should just move on.\n\nMaybe the healthiest thing would\u2019ve been for me to move on at this point. But there is just something inside me that doesn\u2019t allow me to do so. \n\nWe agreed to not let it ruin our friendship again, and next day we were back to form. The friendship kept growing stronger everytime, and we always found some space to talk to each other. I had a near death experience during one of my travels and ended up thinking about a lot of things. That experience made me want to try again what has already failed, so on this last February 14 I organized with so many people to deliver her a letter I wrote while I was out of town. The attempt failed miserably and she told me the next time I tried something like that, she\u2019d tell teachers I was stalking her. That hit hard, but I understood. I knew I had to get away, and so I did. \n\nBut just three weeks later Ace would look for me again to go to a museum with her. I knew I shouldn\u2019t, but I still accepted the invitation. We weren\u2019t in a good place yet, so it was a really awkward day and by the end of it I told her that I couldn\u2019t be the friend that she wanted, and to give me some space to sort things out. \n\nFollowing days were awkward. Until the last day came. Before the pandemic came. It was a Thursday, and we only had one class to go to. I hoped on the bus towards school and saw sue\u00f1o was in it. She saw me too, but we still couldn\u2019t talk. The parallels are just too much. We arrived separately and ended up meeting with some classmates. As small as the circle of friends was, we still couldn\u2019t look at each other. Then again, as the day went by, that circle just decided to chill in a park for a while and Ace and I ended up speaking to each other just fine once again. It was just the perfect afternoon, both for that and because we had great time with our friends. It was time to go home and I told her I still had somethings to do at school, so we couldn\u2019t go back together. Of course I lied, but because I knew that I still needed to keep my space. I was decided to completely resign to ever being with Ace in a romantic way, to convince myself that it was just a bad obsession that needed to stop. \n\nSo it happened, the quarantine happened. Neither Ace or I would dare text each other, but she would hit me up in the Zoom chat during classes. I didn\u2019t want to be rude so I kept responding and she had some nice conversations in there. After a while she would hit me up in our regular dm\u2019s, and I responded too without much enthusiasm. I still felt the same way as before, so I just decided to drop her off. No more responding, I just wanted my feelings to stop. Yet, she did not desist.\n\nWe started talking, yet again. There\u2019s just something about it now. Something so pure. She has always had a lot of issues accepting herself. She has a lot of issues that she\u2019s been fighting against for some time now. Both physically and physiologically. She doesn\u2019t really talk to a lot of people, and has found comprehension and understanding in talking with me. Sharing stuff with me. She can be herself  while she\u2019s with me and that\u2019s just something I can\u2019t ignore. I want to be there for her out through it all. I want her to find herself so she can start loving herself. She deserves it. She always wants the best for everyone. Even though it\u2019s hard for her to find interest in anything, she will always defend those who need it. She tries to be fierce in the outside but she\u2019s just so sweet on the inside. There\u2019s just so much to love about Ace, that I really want her to realize. \n\nWe have been talking for weeks now, losing sleep and all, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for it. I have come to understand what it is that I feel. And I can safely say that I love Ace. I really do. And I\u2019ve learned that doesn\u2019t mean that we should be together as a couple, or that she even loves me back. But I just want the best for her. I want her to know what makes her happy, I want her to feel accepted. I love everything that she tells me, all her imagination comes up with that she doesn\u2019t share with anyone else. Al the crazy thoughts she has, all that makes her smile, and all that doesn\u2019t. Everything that upsets her, and everything that makes her mad. It\u2019s all important, and I love her for all of that. She deserves the best, and I\u2019m just here for whatever she needs. She\u2019s finally finding herself, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. Once she does, I know that she\u2019s gonna find someone else. She deserves to find someone that makes her feel the way she makes me feel. \n\nI have no doubts. I know what I feel and Ace has made me understand what love is, even if she hasn\u2019t realized. Love doesn\u2019t only stop with a significant other. Love is a force that is shared thought every living being. Every experience with Ace has made me value the people that I love, and that love me back. I wanna give my best to every one of them, and so shall I. In her case, that means to he lp her liberate herself. We\u2019re close now so that in a future we may be separated. So she will stop needing me. And that\u2019s something that can be applied to everyone. People come and go, and all we can do is love them as hard as we can while they\u2019re here. To love is to respect. To love is to understand. And most importantly, to love is to liberate.", "title": "To be free"}, {"created_utc": 1592519657, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/hbol9l/owning_your_journey_and_celebrating_life_a/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Owning your journey and celebrating life.

Every time I meet someone I really try to give it my all and be as honest and open as I can. I want to show them myself and have them fall for the real me. Problem is most of them don't appreciate me and just want to use me for sex but a lot of them will not come out and say that. They sugarcoat and make me believe they care and there's potential (which is far worse in my opinion)\n\nIn my 30s and at this point in my life I'm definitely not looking for a hook up. I'm not looking to run down the aisle either. I'm just looking for someone I can spend my time with who cares about me and vise versa and is tired of all the games and nonsense. Someone to travel with and grow together. Someone where we can inspire each other to do better in life and push each other to obtain our goals. I've seen this happen before with other couples. \n\nI'm so chill and laid back. I'm not pushy or demanding but I'm also not a pushover. I'm smart, I get told they think I'm pretty or beautiful or \"hot\" a lot. I'm funny, independent, caring, thoughtful. These are all things I've been told by men not something I'm just spouting off about myself although I do believe these traits about myself. The problem is it's still never enough for a guy to be like \"Wow I really like her. I never want to let her go.\"\n\nMost of the time they end up choosing someone who's the opposite; needy, clingy, bossy, controlling, demanding, plays games, cheats on them, uses them for money, lies and manipulates them. I've seen this happen time and time again. Then sometimes they try to crawl back to me but I'm like no.\n\nI've even had guys chase after me professing their \"love and feelings\" for me then as soon as I give them a chance they play games and move on to the next girl. I've realized that a lot of guys (and girls too) I don't want to just hold men to this. A lot of guys that I've encountered aren't really looking for love...not real love that is. Real love to me is being kind, caring, thoughtful, appreciative, respectful, open, honest, communicative, listening, understanding, willing to compromise, forgiveness (on certain things) and above all trust. I try to show these things are important to me but a lot of the guys look at me like I'm from outer space. Most of the time they just want to play games and want me to play back with them. I'm tired of that. I've never really been into games and think they're a waste of time.\n\nI've realized that most of the guys I've encountered are looking for the \"idea\" of love or are looking for someone to --love them-- but aren't necessarily looking to reciprocate that love. And that isn't fair. I've had men idealize me which also isn't fair and when I don't fit their fantasy of me they leave me. I want someone to love me for who I am. I don't think theres anything wrong with what I'm asking. I love getting to know someone and all their little flaws that make them unique. No one is perfect and it's about loving someone's tiny (but innocent) perfections. But a lot of guys I meet don't see it that way I'm noticing.\n\nSo now I'm at the point in my life when it doesn't work out with someone. No matter how much I like them, if they leave, or if I decide to leave them I don't get as sad anymore. I use to get real emotional when it didn't work out with someone but now I just tell myself they weren't the right one and move on. And then I meet another one and it's like the cycle repeats itself again. I'm also trying to change any behaviors I may be doing that's a hinder on me and being better at who I'm choosing. Being more selective and looking realistically at any red flags. Looking for more emotionally available men while continuing to work on myself internally and externally. For now I told myself to really just hone in on my goals but it would be nice to just have someone's love and support. I don't even have that many friends because most of them ended up disappearing or showed me a side to them I didn't like.

You can tell she was trying to keep herself together. Once you've lived with someone most of your life, you have a sense that something was wrong.

Is it me? It is her work? Is it her depression acting up? All I could do was hold her, as I felt the warmth of her body against mine whilst reassuring her, \"everything's going to be ok, sweetie.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that? How could you possibly understand what I've been going through? All you do is give me solutions, you never listen to me - truly, listen to me.

Although it hurt to hear them, that's the thing about love, you're able to say things to each other without the sugar coating. We always get to the truth, as harsh as it may sound.\r\n\r\nI was silent, stroking her hair, and most importantly, listening. She was right, I've always tried to offer solutions to her myriad of problems. But lately, I've come to realise that perhaps the real solution for some scenarios is to just listen and not to offer any advi ce. When you offer advi ce, no matter how good-willed you are, it may at times be misconstrued as a lack of empathy. Perhaps right now, I'm dealing with the years of solution-finding as she's still crying in my arms.\r\n\r\n\"I know you love me, and I know you're hurting from my accusations right now and I\u2019m so sorry to put you through this.\" she pulled back and looked up into my eyes. We were still in bed, our bodies in a tangled mess. Everything seemed so normal, so perfect, yet this sobering reality of a conversation held a strange aura over us, rendering me a little anxious. Something didn't seem right.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not happy, I haven't been happy in years.\"\r\n\r\nNo amount of love could cushion the blow of hearing this from your life partner. I grimaced, clearly shaken by her words. \"What do you mean?\" I questioned, although not genuinely wanting to hear the ensuing reasons for fear of how much it'll hurt. It's as though a deep chasm has opened up between us and our hearts now felt a million miles away from each other as she composed herself. No longer crying.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't been happy in a long time, I just haven't been able to tell you. Objectively, we look so perfect. Our friends love us, we're the ideal for so many people that we know. My girlfriends love hearing about the things you do for me and as you've told me, you speak so highly of me to all your friends too. I know we're perfect for each other. I know things have been going so well. In light of all this, I'm just not happy and I've been feeling like this for years now. What's wrong with me?\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is, I didn't know what was wrong. Maybe I have been a bit emotionally distant. She told me she understood why I've been like this but no excuse can justify why I've made her unhappy for years. All this seemed too much for me as I listened on, careful to really listen to her and for once, not offer any solutions. Perhaps there wasn't a solution to where we are right now. I felt myself grow distant from her with every word she said, with every accusation mentioned, and whilst I grew antagonised, wanting to defend myself, for some strange reason, I sensed a deep sense of futility as she seemed to have already made up her mind on this matter.\r\n\r\n\"What do we do now?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nNone of us said a word for a whole minute as we just looked at each other. Words didn't seem necessary. Something very fundamental has shifted within us. Her eyes no longer resemble the girl I fell in love with 20 years ago.

At the camp, I met this girl. She was stunningly beautiful and so kind to me, which I wasn't used to. Usually people treat me awfully. Anyways, she had a pair of gorgeous blue eyes and long blonde hair. To say the least, she was my dream woman, personality and image wise. I was shy and didn't gather up the courage to talk to her until the last few days of camp but I watched her for the whole summer. It felt wrong to follow her but I just couldn't control it. She intrigued me and I couldn't resist. \n\nThe last day of camp, we said goodbye. I hugged her and, although I hate to admit it, I was crying. She was too, but i didn't understand why. She was way out of my league and I doubted she would ever give me the time of day - not that I blame her. When I got home, I dialed her number, which she had written on my palm. However, she didn't answer. It went straight to voice mail, so I decided to wait and tried again later that day. Again, it went straight to voicemail. I left a message and fell asleep. I called her every day since then, but she never answered. Days, weeks, months even passed until one day, I got a call from my friend. He told me he had found her on social media and gave me her username. \n\nI added and messaged her. But it felt weird because it had been almost a year now since we had last spoke. It didn't matter to me though because I needed her. To my surprise, she actually replied. We talked for awhile, about things like camp and how we had been. Then, finally, I gathered the courage to admit my feelings for her. Sort of. \n\nI told her, \"I have a crush on this special girl but I'm afraid she'll reject me. I don't know if I should tell her but I don't know if I can afford not to. I know it isn't your problem but do you have an opinion?\"\n\nShe replied telling me something along the lines of, \"I think you should go for it. I highly doubt she would say no. You're an amazing guy and anyone would be lucky to have you.\"\n\nSo... I told her the 'special girl' was her. She told me she felt the same way and I nearly died from happiness. We started going out after that. (She was the one that asked me out and I'm glad she did.) My favorite part of the day is when I get to talk to her. She tells me she loves me and misses me. I write her poems and tell her the same. I never get bored of our chats. \n\nWe were both excited for the next year of camp and just couldn't wait. She told me she couldn't wait to hold me and kiss me. We also wanted to dance together again (every year, they held a dance for one day at the camp.) Unfortunately, camp was cancelled that year due to bad weather. My depression grew and I missed her horribly. But I knew if I could wait for her for one year, I could wait one more. We didn't go one day without talking and saying I love you. And then the day came. Two years I waited, and finally I saw her again.\n\nShe was just as beautiful as I remembered. We hugged and kissed, held hands and danced. It was an amazing time. When camp ended, I introduced her to my parents. They loved her almost as much as I did. She became a part of my family. And although we were too young to get married yet, I bought her a ring anyway. \n\nI'm happy to admit that we're still together and that I am the luckiest man on Earth. I love her with all my heart and wouldn't give her up for anything. If you really love someone, you should tell them.

Once you make your choice and let yourself go, the explosive thrusters will lift you and your love off the ground and surpass any atmospheric resistance holding you back. We can call this the lovey-dovey phase, where everything feels good and right. Even the not-so-good stuff is filtered through rosy glasses. On average the lift-off phase will last two to three years. Make the most of it, because, let me be honest, you have a bumpy ride up ahead.\n\nThen the propulsion engines start running out of fuel. The rocket now quiets down and the thrill of the launch fades into more normal everyday life. This is a critical phase. Young couples without experience might think they made a bad mistake at this point. They want to get back to the exhilarating feeling of being swept off their feet. Don\u2019t give in to these thoughts just yet. \n\nNow is the time to get to work. The best tools for getting through this phase are romance, heart to heart communication, truthfulness, reliability and a whole lot time of patience. Use those rosy glasses again, even if you have become wise to their obscuring reality. This phase may sound laborious, but it\u2019s the best investment you\u2019ll ever make. It will pay off later. \n\nDuring this period a lot of couples decide to have children. Having kids will dramatically change the dynamics of your journey. They will fill your days with fun and games, cuddles and kisses and a whole lot of extra work and responsibility. You won\u2019t even have time to long for thrusting rocket launches. You\u2019ll be busy coordinating this new, all-encompassing unit of love and stress. \n\nWhilst busy rearing kids you might also regretfully neglect to nourish your spouse with the tools mentioned above. There is still time, so send the children to grandmas and get some romantic loving and special attention going. Learn to listen more and talk less. That way you\u2019ll really get to know the inner workings of your lover. There are still rivers to explore and mountains to climb. You\u2019ll be surprised how much deeper a human being is, than you first assumed. Listening also leads to fewer misunderstandings.\n\nWARNING: If you wait too long without nourishing your spouse, love will die, and all will be lost. You\u2019ll be ejected out of the rocket with a parachute. You\u2019ll land in some random field, break a leg or two, and the set-back will take months, if not years, of your life. So, take heed. \n\nThe achievement of making it passed the seven-year marker should be celebrated with a romantic weekend for two. At this point the chances of a crash-landing drop significantly. Neither of you could ever dream of swapping it all, for a new seven-year ride, that may or may not work out. Unless your relationship is unhealthy or in someway poisonous, in which case changes must be made, the sooner the better.\n\nYou are now drifting through space, passing strange planet-systems on your way. Beware of gravity. Some planets will try to suck your shuttle into dangerous territory and eventually destroy it. Third party interference must be rooted out quickly or it will rapidly become a serious threat to your unit. \n\nA secret: Every couple have their ups and downs, no matter how glamourous they appear from a distance. If your spouse is down for a while for whatever reason, that is not the time for arguments and threats. It\u2019s the time for comforting and support. This is the stuff love is made of.\n\nAs your children slowly turn into more self-governed teenagers, you\u2019ll find you have more heaven-sent time and resources. You\u2019re still young enough to enjoy the pleasures of life. Use these resources as you see fit, for your own fulfilment. You\u2019ve earned it. Just remember not to spend it all on yourself. Save the best for your spouse. \n\nYou are now approaching the last leg of your journey and this phase is often very enjoyable. Your love-life is turning into an orchid of beautiful trees and flowers, peaceful, sunny afternoons with tea and cookies on the porch, dining with good friends, watching the waves hit the beach as you laugh about something hilarious you remember. You have a long history together and will have loads of good memories to chat about. \n\nAnd if the doorbell rings, it\u2019ll be those adorable grandchildren. Give them some good memories, then send them home when you\u2019ve had enough for one day. \n\nYou will now be grateful and content, proud of what the two of you have achieved. You\u2019ll also be glad you didn\u2019t succumb to those thought of greener grass elsewhere. It may look greener from time to time, but hardly ever is.\n\nYour rocket will ascend gracefully into infinity, but your legacy will live on for generations to come.\n\nHave a good journey", "title": "Love is a rocket"}, {"created_utc": 1580819402, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/eypcd9/my_gorgeous_human_3/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "My adorable partner has the world's most beautiful eyes.

First, backstory, it was the winter nights of January in 2019, I was a 16 year old kid looking for love like everybody else, and I turned 17 in March. I had a close friend from childhood, all the way since Kindergarten who I basically loved like a brother. We were two guys with their own habits, and we had the connection like that, but this was when I was beginning to realize how much he was the antithesis of me. Already he had caused me a thorn, a nicotine addiction we shared which he had started for me. See, he was simply looking for flings, treated girls as objects and all, I had always seen things differently from him, and his latest ruse was to \"get revenge on a bitch\" because they'd unofficially dated for a week or so before he became sick of her and wanted to ruin her. So he requested that I purposely become her boyfriend and surely but slowly manipulate her to a point where I break up with her and tell her she's worth nobody's time. I warranted none of it, telling him point blank he needs to get over himself. He was drowning in vice, experimenting with hard drugs like crack and no matter how much I tried to set him on course for a stable life, he wouldn't have it, and some part of my naive self at the time believed him the bigger man, and that he was more masculine cause of his mistreatments. Funny thing I was all along seen as the more stoic and \"manlier one\" but I digress. He convinces me to meet this girl, and in a small footnote tells me, \"Oh and she's got a friend, hear she's easy and dtf, pull up\" this psycho was meeting face to face with the girl he despised and pooling me along to try and make a swift move. I came and meet the girl he hates, when out walks behind her this meek, and innocent girl who was my age rather than her friend who was a year younger. We barely speak but she's captivated me, and we exchange snaps talking for three days straight none stop. I begin to feel it and we meet again in person at the local mall all four of us. Stunning my delinquent friend and the girl who foolishly is enamoured by him, me and this meek girl slip away together and run off to a park at night where we listen to the Smiths, a band she's never heard of, and I enjoy. We share our first kiss, and it leads to the next chapter of my life, one I'd thought I'd never have. One year later nearly to the day and we've not weakened only strengthened. My snake crackhead excuse of a \"friend\" tried to tear us apart with lies, rumors, and sheer physical force which culminated with me ripping her away from her poor life tied to them all, myself included, and I was to my amazement successful. Nowadays, we're going all along happy, safely proclaiming with the ultimate pride our soulmate status.

And more importantly, how do you know that they\u2019re saying it for you, and not for them? Well, that\u2019s exactly what Zen Buddhist master Thich Nhat Han has discussed in his book, How to Love. Below, we\u2019ve found a passage where he explains why \u201cI love you\u201d might not mean what you think it does.\n\n**What \u201cI love you\u201d really means**\n\nThich Nhat Hanh At the heart of Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s teachings is the idea that \u201cunderstanding is love\u2019s other name.\u201d In other words, to love someone is to fully understand his or her suffering. Thich Nhat Hanh says that when people say \u201cI love you\u201d, they are caught in the idea of \u201cself\u201d and focused on the \u201cI\u201d. But according to Thich Nhat Hanh, true love involves letting go of the ego and understanding that we\u2019re in this together: \u201cOften, when we say, \u201cI love you\u201d we focus mostly on the idea of the \u201cI\u201d who is doing the loving and less on the quality of the love that\u2019s being offered. This is because we are caught by the idea of self. We think we have a self. But there is no such thing as an individual separate self. A flower is made only of non-flower elements, such as chlorophyll, sunlight, and water. If we were to remove all the non-flower elements from the flower, there would be no flower left. A flower cannot be by herself alone. A flower can only inter-be with all of us\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Read the full article here](https://corespirit.com/articles/zen-master-explains-what-it-really-means-when-people-say-i-love-you)", "title": "Zen Master Explains What It Really Means When People Say \u201cI Love You\u201d"}, {"created_utc": 1580799346, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/eym54a/i_want_a_word_thats_more/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "My boyfriend and I always yearn for a word more than just \u201clove\u201d.

WARNING\u26a0\ufe0f it's probably gonna be pretty long. So, my BFF and her twin brothers moved to my town when I was 9. Just a little background, I had just moved from America 2 years before. So, me and my BFF I guess immediately hit it off. We always met each other at church every Sunday, along with her brothers. Then they started coming to the same school I attended. My school is pretty small, so my BFF's bro was pretty popular as girls crushes(probably because of his looks). Anyway, I didn't like him at first. I thought he was super annoying. But pretty much the whole school started calling my BFF's bro and I a 'couple'. I really hated it,and denied it every chance I got. I don't know what he did. He seemed oblivious to it all. So this went on for a couple years, and I was starting to question if I really liked him. I mean, everyone was saying I did. I couldn't figure out if I liked him as a friend or something more. Finally, I ended up confessing to myself that I really did like him. My BFF even said she thought he liked me too. He acted different at school, though, around his friends. When I would spend the night at my BFF's house, we actually would talk and get along, like real friends. I told my BFF to tell him I liked him and then say jk, just to see his reaction.

We went on our separate ways, but we added each other on IG and started chatting off and on up until today. So at first for me it was just chatting and very light flirting since I had a gf, but then I broke up with her. We tried to get together some times, but it never happened, either because I was busy, or our schedules never matched.

I was like, ok, and decided to set up a date. \nWe finally set up a date, and got together in her town for a few hours. We went eating and then, got a couple of drinks. We talked about anything and everything: holiday adventures, music, relationships... While on the 'date', she made future plans with me several times, like going to a concert, to a bar etc... She said things like 'Next time we meet, I'll come to your town'. She wasn't particularly flirty, neither was I, but we had some good fun together. While we were walking she slightly leaned towards me sometimes, and I could feel her arms touching mine. Finally, she said 'Thank you for coming today, it was really nice to see you again', we hugged, and we both said goodbye.

I know you won\u2019t have time to read this in the morning, and that\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t sleep again. Insomnia really sucks. I was thinking about us though. A lot, actually. You make me happy. Really happy. And I know that I make you happy too. It\u2019s hard for me to accept that, that someone can be happy as a result of being with me. I\u2019ve spent the majority of my life just trying not to be a nuisance to people around me. But seeing your smile every time you look at me reminds me every day that I make you happier. I am so glad I can do that for you. When I am with you my life is so much better. I love that we can share our innermost insecurities, tell our most closely held secrets, and still not look at each other any differently. I never want that to change. I also love the fact that we are best friends. We can get really romantic and cute, or intimate and physical, but at the end of the day we still are the same dumb and goofy best friends we\u2019ve always been. I\u2019m glad that our relationship didn\u2019t change because we\u2019re together now, it just got added onto. Everyday we are both learning how to be in a healthy relationship, and I am grateful that we are learning together. I trust you, and I have never trusted someone like this. Because of my severe anxiety and paranoia, I always feel like everyone is out to get me. Like I\u2019m being lied to, or tricked.

I have never felt this attracted to someone in my life. In every way. I\u2019m attracted to your personality, your face, and your body. You are so caring and kind, you have such a big heart. I could stare into your eyes forever, and I would kiss your lips all day if I could. I love your smile, it\u2019s one of the best things I\u2019ve ever seen. You make me look forward to the rest of my life, for the first time ever. I have smiled more since I met you than I have in the entire rest of my life combined. You help me through so much, even if you don\u2019t know it. Just the thought of you makes me feel better when I\u2019m upset. You have no idea how many times I\u2019m in a bad mood and I just turn on my phone and stare at your face on my lock screen. You are the love of my life. And by that I mean you are the biggest reason why I love my life. We can have days where we are intimate and physical, we can go out and walk around town, or we can just cuddle and watch movies.

After two weeks of messaging and phone calls he told me he wanted to meet me in person. I agreed to meet him in a public setting. I got there early and waited for him to arrive. He arrived right on time and the moment he saw me he picked me up off the ground and hugged me. I noticed he kind of had that crazy look in his eyes but I brushed it off. He bought me a coffee and we proceeded to talk for few hours. From the start, he wanted to make moves on me.

I am new to dating. I am only 19 and he is in his 30's. He is actually the first man I have officially been on a date with/kissed. Being the girl that I am, I decided to go to his house because I trust too easily. It is a small farm house from the 1800's out in the middle of nowhere. (You would think I would have had the sense to just turn around and drive back home or somewhere safe like Starbucks, but a combination of my  love of the thrill of being in potential danger and my stupidity made me walk up to his door. He opened the door and told me to come inside. He lives with his mom I guess, and she was downstairs. I greeted his mom and then I agreed to go upstairs to his bedroom. (My biggest mistake yet, you'd think I was asking for what was to come) He showed me his room and told me to sit on his couch. I sat there with him. We got to talking and he opened up to me about his past problems with the law. He told me he had been to jail 13 times before and that he has a new court date set for next month because he had gotten into a fight about me with his X girlfriend and he wound up knocking her out by hitting her in the back of the head.

I did not scream, I did not run, I did not flinch. I gave him no signs that I was afraid of him. I'm thinking in my mind \"This man is big, very strong and is on top of me and I have no way of getting out of this. Out of fear I let him french kiss me. I let him touch me. I let him do what he wanted to do. I did not know how to be intimate like that, I just let him have his way with me. I am still in shock about the entire situation but I made it out of there okay.

It\u2019s either an affection, a desire, an admiration, even a devotion, but one thing we all know is that we can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to live with out love. Seemingly, love can be all of those things, but can it be more, and can it even be defined? Surely anyone that has truly been in love can\u2019t always explain why they love someone,  because there\u2019s a bond that just exists with out explanation.\n\n\u201cLove isn\u2019t when you can name a million things you love about the person. Love is when you can\u2019t even find words to describe how you feel about them.\u201d -unknown\n\nWithin my research around the subject of love I discovered that there are reasons why we have bonds with some and not with others. You may be physically attracted to someone but have no desire in being in a relationship with them and why is that? It has been proven that we actually seek out mates with people that have similar DNA to us- people that think the same, possibly look similar or are similarly attractive, have similar needs and thinking etc.  So following the pattern of Science it might make sense that someone who is good looking, has acquired a lot of skills and talent in a lifetime and is extremely tall would have a harder time finding a mate vs. someone of an average height, who is averagely good looking, and has average talent.  Sounds funny right? But makes sense. Rarity would then link with other rarities.\n\nSo where did love come from, how did it come to exist?  The word love was essentially created from the saying s\u2019agapo in Greek which means I love you, but in the Greek language this love was known to be a deeper, passionate, true love vs. the love that you may have with say a sibling or friend.  The pronunciation of the word its self is tracked down to the English and Germans(old English and old Saxon) way, way back in the day when each of them had words leof: meaning dear and luba: meaning love derived from lufu- one of the first words for love that ever existed.\n\nThrough out history love has been something that has been brought together by religion, tradition, duty, and wealth, timing all the way back to ancient Greece.  In today\u2019s society we make the choice to love, we make the choice to bind our selves to someone through passion, bond, friendship, and desire.  No one is telling us we have to marry someone for familial wealth or because of our religious beliefs(I hope). So, have the commonalities of old time traditions and beliefs moved forward within our actions- the point that someone can love and still act outside of love while the romanticized reality of love has grown allowing us to find love with whom ever we deem fit?\n\nI think we can agree, that love is a feeling of deep emotion; but a feeling and actions can be separated.  So how do we as people whom love, separate the idea that you could love someone and yet still act against that love?  Humans sometimes cheat, hurt, and lie\u2026 is love not combined with those actions?  However dramatic or fairy tale-esque I\u2019ve always believed that love should be one grand idea, that the feeling of love and the actions that define you within that love should mirror one another.  And if you really devour that idea, you would only want to do that for someone that you have such a deep lufu for.  Love.  It really does determine you.\n\nWhen I asked some of my girlfriends \u201cWhat is love?\u201d The answers varied greatly, even some of them defined it as possibly being many things and yet nothing in singularity.  But, when I asked them \u201cWhat is love to you?\u201d They were then taken to a place of memory, of conversation, of emotion, of desire.  The feeling, if it was ever indeed taken away from them, they would do almost anything to get it back.  So what signifies, what defines love outside of the common definitions that Merriam-Webster lays out for us?  Is it the ability to want to do anything for that person?  To be bound to them by choice and have your actions mirror those choices? Or is it as simple as the passion you have between one that you will never have with another?  The only true test to love is the one we end up living.\n\nLove keeps us going, keeps us holding on to our days, gives us a reason to be, to care for, to create, to be more, to desire, to daydream.  What ever true love is to you, if you\u2019ve found it don\u2019t let it go.\n\n\u201cBeing deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.\u201d \u2013 Lao Tzu.\n\nSigning off from a bed somewhere on the east coast, Oni~", "title": "What is love, actually?"}, {"created_utc": 1580688276, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/exxxvm/its_so_hard_not_to_stare/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just want to stare at him!

I just went with the flow and we started kissing...etc it was actually my first time an I did not tell him because I did not know when the right moment was so yeah it did not went pretty well but it did not bother any of us we just talked after it and walked to the train station holding hands.

It is not that I don't like it but somehow it feels a little bit forced I don't know I just want to know him better so I can feel more comfortable around him. The problem now lays that I moved away to another city and didn't had contact with him for a long time.

I could really use some guidance this will be long and I appreciate everyone who reads this.\n\n\nSo I have a girlfriend who I\u2019ve been with for five years. We have two dogs and a one-year-old beautiful little girl. Last month she decided to leave me because I suffer from depression and for four years I have not taken care of it. I know it\u2019s taking a huge toll on herself trying to get me to better myself and get the therapy/medication that I need. We had a house together even though she paid for most of it because I was still searching for a job out of college and she got a great job out of college.\n\nSo last month we got into a huge argument and she left me and the decided that I needed to leave the house. The past month I\u2019ve been chasing to get her back but it seems that she\u2019s lost some love and is unhappy with our relationship. I\u2019ve been trying to convince her that it can be changed because I know it could be because all of our problems stem from my depression.\n\nThis past weekend the medication I was taking made me feel suicidal and I told her and she decided that for now I am not to be alone with our daughter and that is fair but it hurts me a lot. I\u2019ve been talking to a therapist to better myself and I\u2019m on different medication now and it seems to be working better. \n\nSo my anxiety plays a huge part in this too and now I\u2019m at the point where it\u2019s like why is this happening, why would she leave me when I\u2019m at my lowest point, and why did this have to happen to me and why couldn\u2019t I seek assistance when I should have like the other multiple times I told her I would.\n\nI know she loves me a lot and cares for me more than anybody else in this world but it\u2019s hard trying to go on in life without her and my family that we started together. She asked for space from the beginning and I didn\u2019t give it to her and now I finally am and it\u2019s been a few days since we\u2019ve talked and seen each other. She truly is the perfect person for me and I know she knows that we are both perfect for each other and I am hoping that this is just one of our bumps in our journey together and then one day we can look back and realize we needed this and I need this to be a better partner and a better father. But then part of me says that maybe it\u2019s too late and then I chased her off and she\u2019s only holding on because we have a daughter together.\n\nThat\u2019s basically the just of it I hope somebody can give me some guidance. I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m looking for and what answers I\u2019m looking for but any guidance would be appreciated and if anyone needs any more description of what\u2019s happened the past for five years I would be gladly to tell you guys so that I can get some answers that maybe I\u2019m looking for or not looking for.

I never been to university so for me to have a relationship throughout it all is mind boggling. I regretted not going myself or doing more productive things. i thought in relationships you prioritize the one you love and I've been there for her every single day sadly. i should've prioritized myself more but I'm just lazy. this story may be all over the place but i don't care. my heart hurts and right now i just want to vent. we've been dating long distance for 4 years. never any contact only video calls and voice calls. I know that's insane right but do mind we were young at the time around 19 and she was 18. I should've manned up and made money to go see her when she wanted me to during our 4th year anniversary but in my mind i knew i had no money to see her. i could've asked my parents but i didn't want to ask them for money out of self respect. i didn't want to talk to her about it either to make her think I'm a poor low life. but i treated her well, i treated her like an actual princess. however, there were times where she wouldn't answer my calls anymore or reply to my texts as fast anymore and i assumed maybe our love was fading, turns out she's talking to other guys behind my back and eventually i found out. it may not seem like \"cheating\" but it was surely disrespectful to the relationship and even though we've tried to move past that I've always been paranoid from then on and that made me a demon in her eyes. I couldn't control that side of me and so we fell apart in such a horrendous way.  I do think about her, but i think her life is better without me as much as i loved her she's completely gone and cut me out of everything and there's no way i can ever reach her again. there goes 4 years.   \n\n\nanother girl I've met the recent girl that broke up with me and broke my heart. this girl was smarter and way better. she had the mind of a philosopher. she can talk and make things entertaining and i adored her so much and her atmosphere. I'm not going to details how we met and how we ended up dating so I'm just speeding it up. sadly I've fucked it up. while everything was going so well for a few months, i WAS the one flirting with a girl behind her back. I became the one that was disrespectful. why did i do this? while she was at school i just became stupid and wanted to entertain myself by flirting with this girl. not because my current girlfriend at the time couldn't fulfill me or anything it was just my form of entertainment and it wasn't going to lead anywhere. she hated it, she hated me. She became paranoid of every single girl after we've tried to solve it. i broke her, i made her think differently of how girls approach me and i approach them now it's not the same. as much as we try to move past it and i appreciate the way she even stayed with me after that but i broke her and made her become someone that she's never been before and that made her hate me deep down. sadly I've tried to move the relationship forward by being more cheerful and happier but she always ends up bringing up that time whenever we argue and i feel that she's hurt and it scared her so part of me wanted to let her go because of it but she didn't want to. her definition of love is when you can share anything with the person  \n\n\nif this gains popularity I'll continue the story. i guess. i just wanted to spill this out.", "title": "i fucked up and i'm hurt i should fix myself."}, {"created_utc": 1594200068, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/hndwff/so_much_more/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "Love is so much more than a romantic relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s watching your younger brother fall for a girl and him gushing about every detail.

No, I am not excusing how I treated you, but I really am a stronger person because of you- no I\u2019m a better person because of you. I got through everything because you told me you would always be cheering me on. Thinking through all of it. I get it now. I know you saw behind the mask who I really am, and you wanted to bring the real me out. To trust in you. To grow with you. \n\nThat is who you are, someone so amazing you bring out the best in people around you. Its why I became a soldier, I wanted to protect the people who cared about me. I wanted to protect the people who protected me, people like you. Because of you I did. Still more than anything else I want to not only be strong enough to protect you, I want to be brave enough to be there for you. Even though I have known all of this and have for a long time. I cannot hurt you again. I never wanted to, and I never ever want to make that mistake again.\n\nSo that is where I am at. It is like you want me to love myself, you want me to be brave. It is frustrating I can with everything else but this. And like, how can I?  I hurt you Rachel, you, the girl I love. You are the girl who literally saved my life. And I push you away. Knowing all of this how can I face it? How can I forgive myself for that?  How do I even approach a situation as complicated as this? You were, and still are so incredibly important to me and I just want to do this right. I want you in my life, I want to be there for you. Yes, I am afraid, I\u2019m honestly terrified. And you know what?  That is all self-doubt I am not letting that consume me again.  So, I\u2019m going to ignore it. I promise you I am going to be brave for you.", "title": "Pushing you away"}, {"created_utc": 1594179796, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/hn9t98/the_unexpected/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "\n\nThe man I\u2019m in love with is nothing short of amazing. From the very beginning, I knew there was something special about him and that I wanted to have him in my life for a very long time. In what still seems to be a dream, we confessed feelings for one another in just a small amount of time. It was unexpected but the most pleasant of surprises. To this day, it remains one of the best moments of my life (if not the best). He provides me with feelings I never knew were possible: he has proven to me what it really means to love someone. His voice brings butterflies to my stomach and the sound of his laughter is enough to bring me to tears, filled with joy. His humor is one of a kind and absolutely precious, made up of inside jokes no other could possibly understand. Looking into his eyes produces the greatest feeling of calm - my choice of drug if I had to choose one. His arms are the place where I\u2019m able to forget all my troubles and focus on the good in this world. His dimples are the cutest ones known to man. Each time he flashes them, I swear I\u2019m torn apart at the seams, overflowing with love. He has the overwhelming ability to make each and every situation okay by simply being him. He is the most comforting shoulder to cry on and the best listening ear. He gives the best solutions to every problem, thought through thoroughly from every possible perspective. He\u2019s able to make the most intriguing conversations out of any little things, providing me with the best conversations I\u2019ve had in my life. He kindly stays up late into the night with me when I have to study and listens to my early morning lectures for me while I\u2019m fast asleep because I\u2019m too tired to stay awake. He listens to me rant about the most random of things and takes my side no matter how bizarre it us. He is my safe place, my home. He has never done anything but go above and beyond for me. He has always been there for me, no matter what we were going through at the time and continues to be by the day. We\u2019ve been through a lot together but have stuck by each other through the thick and thin. He has endlessly proved his love to me with each day that has passed. I would do anything and everything for him. I often ask myself how I got so lucky, to have what so many want. I wonder how someone could love me the way he does. I don\u2019t linger on the thought for too long anymore though. All I can say is that I\u2019m the luckiest woman in the world to have found my soulmate. I know that this is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with and all I can do is take every moment I can to make him feel the same way he makes me feel. He deserves all the love in the world, to feel just as perfect he is, and to be shown all of this at every turn. He is my true happiness. \n\nI am in love with my best friend. Our love is the kind that books are written about and movies are produced on. I cannot wait to spend each and every day of our lives together, growing older and only more in love. I want to make an endless amount of memories with him. He is my baby, the love of my life, and my favorite person. Here\u2019s to all the late night deals being made, singing/dueting, reading each other to sleep, and other traditions we have held on to over the course of our relationship. While we can\u2019t physically be together right now, my love only grows stronger by the day and is no less than it would be if we were together in person. We\u2019ll get there soon enough, no doubt. If you happen to see this, Happy Anniversary my love. You truly are the best thing that has ever happened to me and I cannot wait to spend the rest of our lives together. While telling you all this over the phone is meaningful to me, it didn\u2019t seem fair to keep my love for you to myself.

Every now and then different friends would say something along the lines of \u2018Oh you should meet Sarah, that would be interesting\u2019 or \u2018I would love to see Sarah and you argue\u2019. \n\nA bit of background on me is that I am interested in politics, socio economics, and history. I enjoy witty conversation and most relevant, I have taken part in organized debates since I was ten.\n\nOver the course of the next two years there were these occasional comments and sometimes I would arrive at a friend\u2019s place and would hear that Sarah happened to leave a little earlier. I was mildly interested to meet the illusive Sarah but never went out my way to do so. \n\n**The First Meeting**\n\nThe story skips to my final year in university. I arrive late to my friends\u2019 party and while being introduced to a few people; I finally meet Sarah. \n\nSarah it turns out is an American (I live in the UK). She moved here shortly before starting university for family reasons. \n\nShe starts the conversation with. \u2018So, you\u2019re Adam. I have heard a lot about you.\u2019 \n\n\u2018All good things I hope.\u2019 I reply with a smile. \n\n\u2018Not exactly.\u2019 She laughs. \u2018Apparently you would be the first man to prove me wrong.\u2019\n\n\u2018So, women do that regularly do they?\u2019 I ask jokingly.\n\nSarah does not appreciate the joke and it starts... Over the next three hours we debate gender equality, politics, world war two, gun laws, religion, sports and even accents. \n\nShe is very good; I would describe her as a natural at thinking on her feet and rebuttals. She speaks with great passion and I can see why some would find her intimidating. My approach is quite different; I am always calm; I use a lot of humour and wit, but it has been said that it can seem that I am teasing. We are basically chalk and cheese, the difference being, my approach winds her up. At one of her more acute moments of passion (anger), one her friends suggest that perhaps she should calm down. Without even turning to him she says. \u2018Stay out of it limp dick\u2019. \n\nEventually the crowed around us thins and our debate winds down with no clear victor. Sarah leaves shortly after and I too make my way home. \n\n**The Second Meeting**\n\nOver the course of the next few weeks there is a lot of conversation among our mutual friends about the debate, with friends taking both sides. There is a bit of a build-up of anticipation for a second showdown. I will not lie, I was nervous. A few days later, I am invited to another friends\u2019 party and am told that Sarah will also be there. I still think the party was organised just to see her and I go at it again for the amusement and entertainment of our friends. \n\nI once again arrive late to the party and as soon as I walk in, the room grows silent. I see Sarah walking toward me. She has fire in her blue eyes and I think to myself, that I am in for a hard time. She stops a few steps away from me and says in a loud voice. \u2018You are a terrorist sympathizer.\u2019 There are gasps in the room. \n\nI happen to be from a Muslim background, but her statement is absurd as I have had debates and given talks against all forms of terrorism. Our friends know this, I know that Sarah knows this. I quickly understand what she is trying to do; she thinks by saying something so outrageous/ offensive, she can throw me off balance and get an emotional reaction or perhaps make me withdraw altogether. But this is not my first rodeo. If she wants to throw a low blow, I am going to pull her pants down. \n\nOne of her friends (limp dick - LD) interrupts with a \u2018Hey now.\u2019 But I raise my hand for silence. I look her in the eyes and say. \u2018Then why is it you want to kiss me so badly.\u2019 \n\nHer brows furrows and I see the confusion on her face, comprehension dawns when her eyes widen slightly and then what I was silently praying for, she blushes, just a little. It gets better for me. One of our friends says, \u2018Aww she\u2019s blushing.\u2019 Sarah stares daggers at the girl who commented and tries to come back with a cool. \u2018You wish.\u2019 But it's too late, she is almost drowned out in the laughter and \u2018awws\u2019 going around the room.\n\nI walk past her to a group of friends who pat me on the back and congratulate me. For the rest of the evening our paths do not cross.\n\n**The Third Meeting**\n\nA few days later, I am in the university library with some friends when the topic of Sarah comes up. I say to them that I think she is very good at debating. My friend asks. \u2018Better than Jake?\u2019 (Jake had dismantled me in an organised debate about neo capitalism). \n\n\u2018Jake beat me in one of my weakest topics. Sarah was going toe to toe with me on some of my most researched, strongest areas. To be honest, there were points where I found myself agreeing with her.\u2019 \n\nIt\u2019s at this point I see my friends looking behind me, I turn back to see what has caught their attention. Lo and behold, Sarah is standing with one of her friends. \n\n\u2018Sounds like it\u2019s you that wants to kiss my ass.\u2019 She says.\n\n\u2018You wish.\u2019 I reply, mimicking her. \n\nBefore she can reply, my friend says. \u2018Not again, can we please just have a chill day.\u2019\n\nTo my surprise, Sarah does not bite his head off. She sits down on our table and for the first time we have a civil conversation. Although we cover topics that we did the first time we met, this time it is more of a sharing of ideas and perspectives with all of our friends chiming in. We all move from the library to a restaurant and we have great time. As everyone starts to head home, Sarah and I are the last ones left. She apologises over the terrorist accusation and I apologise for the kissing remark. We share a nervous laugh and say our goodbyes. As I am walking home that evening, I feel something in my stomach. Butterflies, maybe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the course of the next couple of months, we become better acquainted, we exchange numbers and speak often. We still manage to argue but it is lighthearted and always in private. I know at this point I have feelings for her but I\u2019m still building up the courage to do something about it.\n\nFate, however, is cruel. Before I could make a move, I get a call from my mum, she tells me that my dad and sister have been in a car accident and that I need to come home straight away. I pack a bag and take the next train home. It is difficult to write this part. Unfortunately, my father passed away on the same day and my sister a few days later. \n\nSide note \u2013 You never completely recover from the loss of someone you love. Time it seems does not heal all wounds, just numbs the pain enough for us to continue. \n\nI got messages of condolences from everyone, including Sarah. \n\nDue to my grief and other family issues, I ended up staying at home for a while. I would only return to university to sit my final exams. \n\n**The Last Meeting**\n\nAfter the last exams I did not attend the many \u2018last\u2019 house parties that were going on and kept a low profile. However, one day I ended up at friend\u2019s apartment and a few friends came over, including Sarah. Sarah and I ended up alone in the balcony. It was the first time we had spoken in nearly three months. \n\nShe expressed her condolences again and she tentatively told me how her mum had passed away a few years back and it is what made her move to the UK to be with her dad. I could see tension in her face and asked if that\u2019s why she can sometimes be so angry. Her face changed and I could literally see her closing off from me. \n\nI reached out and held her hand. \u2018It\u2019s okay. You can tell me.\u2019 I said.\n\nShe finally broke down and told me the pain of her losing her mother, the way her step-dad and half siblings treated her, and finally her decision to leave her home, friends and country to get away from all the negativity and live with her real dad in the UK. We spoke for a long time about life and the future. \n\nEventually I heard someone step into the balcony and Sarah let go of my hand. I had not even realised we were still holding hands.\n\n\u2018Hey, you\u2019re not making my girlfriend cry, are you?\u2019 Said a voice with a weak laugh. \n\nI turned around, it was LD. He stood their nervously, I turned back to look at Sarah. She lowered her eyes and mumbled. \u2018We kind of started dating while you were away.\u2019\n\nI was lost for words. I pointed at the door. \u2018My car.\u2019 I said and walked away, I heard a goodbye and waved my hand as I left. I did not own a car.\n\nEnd of part 1", "title": "Of Love and Loss - Part 1"}, {"created_utc": 1594137687, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/hmxae9/a_letter_to_my_future_husband/", "num_comments": 30, "score": 1, "selftext": "A letter to my future husband . \nI don\u2019t know  if I have met you  but I don\u2019t think I have .

She happens to be a friend of another girl I used to crush on before she told me she wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship, and I just decided that staying friends was fine. \n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been seeing a few signs from her that might mean that she\u2019s interested. All of which were through social media so I don\u2019t think I should jump to any conclusions yet, but I\u2019m willing to find out. First off, she followed my \u201cspam account\u201d on Instagram and was only one of 8 people out of 59 who saw it on my story who followed it. She also added me on Snapchat and even saved a brief conversation we had, which I could tell from the gray background and the fact that I can still see it 24 hours after it happened. \n\nNow the one thing that really started making me think this is the fact that I received two notifications saying she liked a photo of mine, and when I tapped to the notification, it didn\u2019t go to the post that she liked. In fact, in my activity it didn\u2019t even show that she recently liked a photo. Which makes me think that she was scrolling through my profile and accidentally liked an old photo and quickly unliked it.\n\nThough one thing that kinda debunks this a bit is the fact that when I messaged her on Snapchat, most of her responses were one word.

We both love our jobs very much, it makes life sweet to go to a job we love and then come home to a person we love everyday.\n\nWe moved into an apartment together about two years into our relationship (two years ago) and our relationship had been awesome, and we knew it would get awesomer with all the time we could spend together. Being an engineer, just about all of my work is done at the office (I spend half my time designing and have my time creating so there isn't much I can do at home since all my things are at work). Maybe I'll have to check my email right before I go to bed but other than that work life ends when I am at home, leaving me 100% of my time at home to enjoy with Claire. At the time, Claire had been a teacher for only a year, so she really wanted to do a great job and show her worth to her bosses. This meant she would spend extra time at home doing her work (mostly grading essays) so that she can be finished with her things earlier and impress the admins. Her hard work as paid off as after only three years as a teacher she is now the head of the english department at the private high school she works at. I'm so proud of her becoming head of department in her mid-20s while the other heads were 38-50.\n\nBut all this has come at a cost.\n\nUpon moving in, I noticed that a lot of the time Claire would be in the office working. Being on my quest to be a good boyfriend, I let her have her space and time. A typical day would be the following: wake up, go to work, come back home, eat dinner, I would try to hang out with Claire but she would tell me she has work to do, I play video games and leave Claire alone, I check the time, see that it's 8 pm, I go to the office, Claire still working, I ask her if she wants to go on a walk, she says she's busy, I go on the walk myself, I come home, I check up on Claire and she would still be working, I play video games in the living room, 10 pm rolls around, Claire walks out of the office ready for bed, we go to bed, maybe make love (was only about 5 minutes when we do and underwhelming), and we would fall asleep. The only exceptions would be if I'm out with my friends for a couple hours when she is working or she would spend time with her friends right after work. On the weekends she would have to go to conferences and filled up the time in between to do work. But regardless there would never be any \"us\" time. Before we moved in together, we would have a date about everyday and sometimes we would stay the night at each other's places. And then we moved in together and she was too busy to spend time with me.\n\nI didn't want to pressure Claire to spend more time with me instead of work as I knew how important it was for her to do a good job. I knew a good boyfriend would be supportive, so I gave her the time and space she needed and did most of the chores so she wouldn't have to. But during this whole time I was suffering. Even though we saw each other everyday, I was feeling separation anxiety from her and it had been ages since she last hugged me (if you read my last post you would know touch is extremely important to me). I felt that I was simply a distant roommate in the life of the girl I loved. I refrained myself from telling her about my growing depression to allow her to chase her career dreams.\n\nI started to cry. On the evenings where she would be working and I would usually be playing Minecraft or Call of Duty, I would sit on the couch and hold a pillow and cry. When 10 pm came around and I knew she would cross the living room to go to the bedroom, I'd clean myself up and no one would be able to know I cried. This happened for a few months. Until one night at around 9 pm, I was on the couch crying like usual and she came into the living room to ask me about a new platform for grading. She walks into the living room expecting to see me staring at my game on the TV but instead sees the TV off and me with tears running down my cheeks while staring into space. Immediately she ran to my side to ask me what was wrong. I was hesitant to tell her so I just say I had a bad day, but Claire being Claire she saw right through my lie. She held my head against her chest and tried to get me to tell her what was making me cry. Feeling a hug for the first time in months, I broke. I cried and told her everything: how I was feeling depressed and separation anxiety, how I hadn't felt love from her in a long time, how I wanted to give her time and support her even though I wouldn't get what I needed from her, how all I wanted was to hold her hand and be her priority. The news hit her hard as she came to the realization of what I was going through. We sat in each other's arms on the couch for hours silently crying together.\n\nWe went to couple's counseling not long after and learned to communicate properly and to not hold back any concerns. We also agreed that no matter how busy life became, we would always dedicate at least one hour of our day to each other. I promised her that I wouldn't hide my feelings from her again and to continue supporting her. She promised me that she would never prioritize anything over me again, and that she would provide me love and touch everyday.  She would come home and work a couple hours until 6 pm, and then spend two hours with me or with friends, and then continue working until 10. From then we can do whatever we want together until bedtime at 11. It's been two years since that happened, and our relationship has grown tremendously. There isn't any more suppression of feeling and there is always a great amount of love and touch. And yes, making love is no longer 5 minutes or underwhelming.\n\nShe recently got promoted, and since school is out for summer we can spend so much more time together. I couldn't be more proud of her.

It was amazing and I felt so much joy. He doesn\u2019t LOVE pda (he tolerates it) and I love pda. I like to hold his hand in crowded places and even just when we walk together. Usually he jokes around and calls me annoying in a silly voice, but this time he said \u2018look at you being all sweet\u2019 in a teasing voice. Throughout the day he reminded me with sweet little words and \u2018i love yous\u2019. At night when we were laying together, he kept telling me how much he loves me and how lucky he is.

We have connected well and have a lot in common and relate in terms of our past experiences, beliefs and view of the world.\n\nShe recently broke off with an emotionally abusive ex. And she has had a past of abusive exes. She said she wants to work on herself and I told her I liked her a lot and care for her.\n\nShe's been going through a lot during lockdown mentally. So I have been supporting her where I can... It was tough as the more I helped and was there for her the more I like her and realised we are very similar.\n\nSo when I told her I liked her a lot she told me she isn't interested at the moment and told me she wants to work on herself after her last relationship which I respect.\n\nShe said it's nothing to do with me but she couldn't date me and something to do with us working together is a big no for her...

I accept it, thinking was the right thing to do, for both.\nAfter that we kinda maintain contact, I was sad, and never really got to think about it to much, always getting something to distract never thinking of it.\nI couldn't hold that for long and I leave, avoiding all the ways of contact and get away. Than I stop to talk and never got contact again, but I never forget her, like every day I think of her, and things, and if i could fight more in that moment of broke, if it was her begging for me to try something and i just accepted, but not wanting it at all.\nAfter like a year and a half we get in touch again, I kinda find her and talk, said sorry for leaving and stuff, she said kinda understand that i need my time and stuff, it was simple, I kinda get relief after that, and then we continue to talk after this and to stuff, more kinda me trying to repair something i think.\nWell, the thing I was avoiding get to me, hitting like a truck, idk if was just my guilty about leaving, she said after that some sad things haooen in her life and she got bad, and kinda bad that I quit and was not there.\nShe said in one conversation that i ask about how she feel about us and stuff, she said she was happy that I'm back, but sad cause the remember that I leave, this hurts on me in so many ways.\nI know its getting confusing now, sorry for that.\nThe thing is, I realise that I still love her with the same intensity, and this got me to the ground. \nI kinda decided that i want to fight for her, It seems right for me that this that I feel is real and bigger than I can imagine.\nThe thing is, it's getting hard to hold this alone, hidding the thing when i see her hanging with new friends and maybe new crushes, that i know exists cause a conversation that i have with a friend of her.\nI don't know how much i can hold this, and if it's worthy go all the way hidding waiting and build confidence with her again.

For some reason you always bounce back into my life. Every single time we would have an encounter you would ring in my head for days. A chorus of your name just slipping around the edges and driving me mad. I am sorry I stopped talking to you. It wasn\u2019t my choice. To say my Ex was abusive is an understatement, but I understand the jealousy they felt when I was around you. I know I let myself be abused and I regret every minute of it but three years of that torture made me realize that I shouldn\u2019t lose myself, lose sight of how I am who I am and how I finally have closure for the years of torment I faced. It was a lesson that had to be learned, but painful none the less. I thought I loved them, I thought we were just meant to be and now you are here in my life again and I realized that nothing has ever compared to just your presence. I can\u2019t describe the connection I have felt for you for a long time. I am sorry I felt like I wasn\u2019t good enough for your presence before and honestly if we started this romance there it would have failed due to my unstable mental state. Now that it\u2019s been a few years I realize that I know I have a lot of problems, but for some reason when I am with you they all seem manageable. I am sorry I left last night. I could feel myself falling into a breakdown and you shouldn\u2019t have to see that. You shouldn\u2019t feel the burden of assisting me with that. I want to be strong on my own first, and for some reason I think I\u2019m succeeding? You taught me coping techniques for my ptsd and fuck, if that shit doesn\u2019t work like magic. Last night was one of those nights where I felt myself falling and did okay on my own. Do you know how big that is? It\u2019s absolutely amazing how much you teach me, how much you have taught me. How I want to learn everything about you and even your flaws just blow me away. When I am with you I feel like the worst has passed, and that the best is yet to come. I know it was stupid how I started talking to you again. How I broke the ice in such a goofy way, but it was what was going on in my life and even after three years you were the first person I thought of for assistance. For some reason you always were there, I would see you, your fucking car you had me name and I would just be hit with a sense of euphoria. How much I wanted to just text you but lacked the courage to do so. Just to get the friendship rolling again. I wouldn\u2019t say that I loved you then, I just missed our friendship. I missed your company. I missed you. I missed how natural it felt to be around you. Fuck, I am so happy that that natural feel just picked back up again. I remember when I first realized I was falling for you, oh my god it was amazing. I noticed how I couldn\u2019t stop talking to you, hearing your voice became a drug like no other. It\u2019s just so soothing to me, how you shape your words and your voice is like a rich honey. It was when we were talking and it was raining, you got up and went outside just like I was and danced in the rain, I could hear your excitement. Feel your joy just radiating off of your words and I just know it was when I realized I needed you in my life for as long as humanly possibly. You just are the best, so patient, so kind, so smart, fucking adorable and sexy, not to mention such a fucking adrenaline junkie just like me. With every day I melt more. I can\u2019t believe I fucked up and let it slip that I love you when we were having sex. I didn\u2019t mean to. Honestly I never remembered it feeing that good, and even though I\u2019m more experienced you just blow me out of the park. It was just like: he\u2019s good at this too, how is this even real? How are you so perfect? Not just physically but mentally too? You are just one of a kind, I couldn\u2019t restrain myself from saying it. Of course I panicked and said that it was just a sex thing, cause we both know I\u2019m an idiot and have no filter around you. I couldn\u2019t stop apologizing, because I felt so bad about it and you just smiled and said it was okay. Fuck your smile just lights up the world. For fucks sake, I almost said two times after that. Once when you started talking about how you liked climbing, something I\u2019ve never had anyone in my life enjoy doing. Like, we could do that together? Holy shit we could do so much together. It\u2019s just another layer that adds to the love I have for you. The second time was the Fourth of July when we were skating through the neighborhoods just finding random spots to see all the fireworks. You let me listen to music and get all stupid because of how hard the holiday is for me, you stepped out of your comfort zone and explored a new place. I know that was hard for you, so I tried to make little moments of calm.  I hope I succeeded. I hope I did okay. I hope I could assist you as much as you assist me? You make me melt. You make me melt so fucking much, I just feel pure bliss in your presence. I hope I don\u2019t fuck this up, I don\u2019t think I could handle you not being in my life again.

That rarely bothered me. In the last months I have been wishing for someone to love, but I did not search for anyone; I just wanted to wait for it.

In the last few days, however, I have decided to take an active approach, albeit it will probably have to wait until the end of the lockdown, since I could not be of much help at a distance. People have recomended that I write letters to my unknown loved one, but I don't know anything about her. Sometimes I think that I have someone to love and that makes me happier(I have been externalizing that will to love by trying to be the most helpful to my friends), but I imagine very littel about her, not even her appearence.  \n\n\nRecently I've read Viktor Frankl's \"Man Search for Meaning\" and in the book he recounts, that, while in the concentration camp, in one morning when the prisioners are going to work, a fellow prisioner wondered how would their wives be, and after that Frankl had in his mind the image of his own wife, with whom she talked in his thoughts. With time, it became more real and he felt as if she was close to him, and he realized that his love was stronger even than death. He said the possibility of she being dead(and she was, in fact) did not change his feeling, and this feeling helped him endure the situation of the camp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if you were rejected by your loved one, you can be happy by his or her own well-being and that you can contribute to it even if the person dislikes you. Being happy with the well being of another person is being able to multiply the person's and your own happiness.

It\u2019s a question that relationship expert Dr. Gail Saltz hears a few times a month, especially from young people. Whether someone is newly engaged or simply has feelings like anxiety or ambivalence about a relationship, she says getting this question is, to her, \u201cno surprise at all.\u201d\n\nYoung adult relationships have long been defined by their intensity (and occasional storminess.) Just look at the youthful affairs that have played out in some of the most iconic stories of all time: the \u201cjock\u201d falling for the \u201cnerd\u201d and shaking up the social hierarchy, the star-crossed lovers, the good girl wanting the bad boy and vice versa. \u201cNormal People,\u201d a new Hulu Original series, is a poignant newcomer to this canon: it tells the story of the complicated relationship between Marianne and Connell, an unlikely pair who can\u2019t help falling for each other.\n\n\n\n_Why do relationships feel so make-or-break when we\u2019re young?_\n\nThese romances are depicted as earth-shattering and soul-shaping, partly for dramatic effect. But there\u2019s a seed of truth in their intensity. Some studies have found that, often, your 20s are a confusing and lonely time, while experts report that large numbers of young adults sometimes struggle with \u201ccaring, lasting romantic relationships and are anxious about developing them.\u201d Which leads back to the question: Why do relationships feel so make-or-break when we\u2019re young?\n\nMuch of it has to do with our emotions, and how well we can cope with them, said Saltz, an associate professor of psychiatry at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine. The brain\u2019s prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for much of our emotional regulation, isn\u2019t fully developed until age 25. So those under 25 can have a \"propensity toward impulsivity and risk-taking,\" said Saltz. This can make it challenging to stay grounded during an argument, for instance, or cause you to inadvertently project emotional hang-ups onto a partner.\n\nThe difficulty also has to do with the newfound sense of independence that young adults often feel, said Saltz. It\u2019s a time when people break away from their hometowns, go to college and land their first serious jobs. With independence comes more responsibility, and more situations when you\u2019re expected to figure things out by yourself, in life as well as relationships. These changes don\u2019t always match up with what your peers are going through, either, making it difficult to fully connect with a partner. In \u201cNormal People,\u201d Marianne goes from being a wallflower in high school to blossoming in college. But when she reconnects with Connell, he seems to be experiencing the reverse.\n\n\u201cYou have to be your own person, make it on your own, and you may not have a lot of time to digest that and mesh your life with somebody else's,\u201d said Saltz.", "title": "The truth about young love"}, {"created_utc": 1589264653, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gi5m2g/i_love_her/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "This distance is about to closed, and these problems are about to be taken care of for us both respectively....worth it.

I learned a lot though and don\u2019t regret this person at all. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve been working on myself in every way.

It was actually during this study abroad trip in Mexico.Well, there was this lovely girl that I met, and I think I was genuinely in love with her.  But she had a boyfriend back home in the States.  And instead of respecting that and just giving her space and being her friend, I became impatient.\n\nIt's like I had to use her to stuff my own emotional hole.  I wasn't loving her, I was using her.  Well, that led to me sending her some vulgar messages that were a sad attempt to get into her pants.  Obviously that didn't go well, and she was understandably mad at me.  But I apologized and she forgave me.  That was a really cool moment.\n\nAnd after that one night she invited me out for beers.  I think by that point I had abandoned my \"goals\" with her.  I knew I had messed up and didn't want to push it further.\n\nBut that night she started to open up about her insecurities.  Things about her dad and what not.  And I opened up to her, too.  There was something special about that night.  And suddenly I realized: \"why hadn't you just loved her this way the whole time?\"\n\nThe answer was obviously because I wasn't emotionally ready to.  But that moment stuck with me. I knew I genuinely loved her.  I felt it.  It's just that all the insecurities and wounds had gotten in the way.  But then I realized: that deeper love, that more compassionate, understanding and accepting love... that was what I was really after.  Not all that other stuff.\n\nAnd that feeling, that moment, stuck with me.\n\nFast forward 7 years later, to today.  There's a new love in my life.  But like the last one, she's off the market.  But that's OK.  Am I willing to only be her friend?  And the answer is yes.   Could there be more?  Maybe, but I can't cling to that fantasy.  I don't want to turn her into an object.\n\nIt's hard.  It's pushing me to love deeper than I have ever loved before.  And at times it's uncomfortable.  At times it's not easy.  At times I can find myself getting a bit obsessive.\n\nBut deep down, just like with the other girl, I know there is something good there.  And this time I have the opportunity to do it right.  This time I'm not going to wait to ask myself, \"why hadn't you just loved her this way the whole time?\"  This time, I'm going to do it right from the beginning.\n\nNot that I won't make mistakes.  I'm sure that I will.  But at least now I know the right direction.\n\nAnd why?  Why would I bother loving someone who I can't necessarily be with?\n\nIt's because love, pure, unconditional love, is such a joy.  The pull is so strong!  I don't care if I can't be with her in all senses, it doesn't matter.  Osho says: enjoy giving love!  And I am enjoying it so much.  It's like your favorite song or something.  You can't explain exactly why you like it, and you're not going to become a better person because you listen to it or whatever.  You just enjoy it.\n\nSo it's a deeper lesson for me.  Because if I can learn to love someone without making any demands upon her, without turning her into an object or forcing my expectations upon her... well, if I can learn to do that with a human being, then I can learn to do that with life.\n\nAnd now you see where I'm going with this...\n\nTake care, folks.", "title": "A new shot at a deeper love, a love without conditions."}, {"created_utc": 1589229364, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ghvxrn/doc_producer_interested_in_hearing_cousin/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm working on a documentary-series about American cousins in love and want to get to hear their stories!\n\nI'm hoping to shed new light on the taboo and bring attention  to the topic by sharing a side of the story that is fairly often silenced/dismissed.\n\nI look forward to hearing your stories!", "title": "Doc Producer interested in hearing cousin dating/marriage stories"}, {"created_utc": 1589226612, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ghv1e7/shes_so_frickin_cute_when_she_sleeps_omg/", "num_comments": 14, "score": 2, "selftext": "I swear I have cute agression (coming from a straight male) she just looks so peaceful and innocent with eyes closed I\u2019m legit just like starring at her ~~help~~.

Despite the curiosity, I have never been with a woman before and have always viewed it as a fantasy of mine.

I know it sounds crazy and at first I just thought it was a coincidence, but week in and out she would just look at me with this endearing look in her eyes smiling and not look away until I started to awkwardly giggle and then the clap would be over and that was it until the next week. And very week I realised it more and more and would think about it so much. Like right now for example I feel like I'm sitting here thinking like a crazy person because I can't stop thinking about her and that look in her eyes, it is just so powerful like I can't explain it. I know it sounds crazy, honestly I do, but I can't help but feel something directing me or pulling me towards this woman and I don't know what to do about it. I cant help but feel that she's so lonely in that house and that she just needs someone to talk to or a bit of friendly company.

It\u2019s not real. It\u2019s just a chemical released in our brain like any other emotion: fear, happiness etc. So why put so much importance on it? Why not just brush it off like any other negative feelings you learn to brush off? Why is love so idolized in our society on such a deep level, and I\u2019m talking through religion. Romance is literally the act of putting too much meaning in this feeling of love and it all started in the 18th century. Romance is basically just the imagination and daydreaming of some classical writers. There\u2019s actually no such thing as \u201csoulmate\u201d or \u201cever lasting love\u201d or whatever fairy tales and BS. The majority of people have been conditioned to believe that our lives should be full of love and joy. But why do we chase away suffering and loneliness so much? Why do this feelings actually hurt us so bad? Maybe because we were conditioned to believe that they are \u201cbad\u201d and that we don\u2019t need to experience them. Why not embrace them? Both darkness and light? Why not accept the fact that darkness is here to stay just as light is and try to find joy through it? Why are we so focused on these feelings? They are just like clouds: they come and go. Long term satisfaction and happiness come from accomplishments in my experience. Love is just lust, but romanticized. People hear from a lot of sources(movies, books, other ppl) that there is this beautiful experience called \u201cfalling and being in love\u201d that everyone should experience. It\u2019s about having a partner and committing yourself forever to them, they say. Building with them, being there for each other forever, finding happiness with them, they say. But where do these ideals come from? It\u2019s culture and religion. You re never gonna see monogamy in nature. Back in the day people were not monogamous. They used to sleep with whoever (even with family members-yes it\u2019s disgusting for me too- but why?cultural conditioning maybe?).\nSo all this ideals are actually just that: fairy tales- created by society and culture. In my experience, and what I notice around me no relationship ever checks the whole thing (no relationship is perfect). So basically we know we re holding ourselves to a standard that can not be attained. \nLove always will end in heartbreak and suffering. Either one of you is cheating, falling out of love, lying/ using deception or maybe dying. Suffering will always come together with love. So why is society putting so much focus on this kind of stuff? On emotions aka on illusions. I think love is a beautiful feeling, but that\u2019a it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually important to our lives, and of course I don\u2019t think we should make decisions based on that. It\u2019s an act of courage and it takes strenght to be vulnerable and open up and love someone and allow someone to love you- I agree. But at the same time you\u2019re giving away your power and people are not perfect so in the end it you always have to pay for it- even if some will way it\u2019s worth it- you still always pay for it. So why do that? Why is this feeling called love so important, special and put on a pedestal in our society?\nAnd this things like \u201cwe should love our neighbors\u201d that religion is preaching- BS too in my opinion. There s a huge difference between this emotion-\u201clove\u201d and for a cause/for the community/ society/ having the desire to contribute to society and help. Not even religions ever respected it fully- why do you think there s been so many religious wars throughout history- only power, and accomplishment are the reasons behind it. No one cares about love is just the illusion they are selling. Fundraisers don\u2019t love everyone. They just believe in a cause, philosophically and want to make things better. And they actually do it without necessarily feeling love- more because of values and a moral compass. Love is just something we were conditioned to believe. In my opinion: accomplishments, getting somewhere in life, doing something with it and also enjoying the process is everything that matters.", "title": "Why is love so important in the first place?"}, {"created_utc": 1590874837, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gtmgt4/how_do_i_know_you_want_me/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "Dear R, \n\nI haven't seen you since Friday.

I was surprised to know that everyone before had already at least one crush on someone, but it just never happened for me. I didn\u2019t care much about it because I didn\u2019t needed that. I was happy with what I already had. \n\n\nWhen i met you for the first time I didn\u2019t thought anything like this will happen. You were just another girl in my class, nothing special. But for some unknown reason you were so kind towards me. I told myself that you are just a nice girl and you probably don\u2019t really want to be near me. But it seems like i was wrong, you actually enjoyed my company. You stayed with me during breaks, i made you laugh and smile, you even texted me, you showed interest in knowing more about me. I was glad to have you as a friend, but i felt something different about you unlike others. I noticed the weird things, this warmth i felt when i saw you and talked with you, you began to look cute in my mind. That\u2019s when I knew that i had a crush on you. Unfortunately one day I figured out you already had a boyfriend, which made me sad but not too much. I told myself that it\u2019s ok because that\u2019s how it is and that I should move on. But I still wanted to be your friend, but a good friend of yours because i enjoyed so much being with you. \n\n\nAs the days passed we got closer to each other and i felt like we are good friends, but i also became more and more obsessed with you. I began to think about you for everyday almost all day, i would become super depressed after a day if we wouldn\u2019t talk much, i would become super happy after a day if we talked a lot, i would just wait all the time for the next moment that we will get to see each other. I just wanted to see you more, hear you more, I wanted to see more of that beautiful smile of yours. You were the only person in my life that made me feel like this, i want to feel more of this strong feelings. But i knew I shouldn\u2019t, because you have someone already and i was happy for you, being a good and a close friend of yours was good enough. \n\n\nThan quarantine happened, i was so sad when it began. I missed you so much and i just wanted to come back to school already. I took the courage to text you sometimes because i just wanted to at least talk with you like that. I was so happy when you were the one to text to me, i knew clearly from that that we are good friends and that you really care about me. That was all I needed during that time. After this 2 months of quarantine it seemed like I forgot this strong feelings that i had for you and how horrible they can be.\n\n\nWhen we returned to school last week, when i saw you for the first time after so long I felt it all again. Were you always that pretty and cute? I was just so out of breath it was hard for me to talk. But thankfully you were happy to see me as well and i was glad that i wasn\u2019t the only one like that. But when i got back home all I could feel was sadness and pain. I didn\u2019t remembered how strong this feelings that i have for you are. I forgot how hard it was for me. That\u2019s when I understood that it\u2019s really the time for me to back off. i would try making less contact with you, i would like to stay a good friend of yours of course but i need some time first. That\u2019s what I decided for myself and i was happy with that, i knew I don\u2019t deserve to feel this way and i knew that it would also be better for her to have a friend that doesn\u2019t actually have a crush on her. I was positive about it, but than something happened.\n\n\nAt the beginning of this week i was very positive about how I\u2019m going to work on myself, i planned what I\u2019m going to do everyday and me and my friends bought a new game to play after school, you were very cute towards me and i managed to kept myself calm while talking with you, everything was going my way. But than I noticed something that I couldn\u2019t ignore. \n\n\nI already knew for sometime about one of my friends which also had a little crush on you. He also knew about my feelings so i wasn\u2019t worried about him, i knew he would respect that but i still kept an eye on him. I noticed already before that you two are talking a little but it never really bothered me. But this time something new happened. \n\n\nI saw how you two are talking with each other, how you both were teasing each other like you are best friends, how much you were smiling and laughing from his jokes, how close you both look. Seeing you like this, seeing you making this expression to someone else, seeing you two like this while knowing how he feels towards you. I felt this anger and sadness growing inside me, it was a new feeling for me and it\u2019s called jealousy. I never felt like it before, but also thanks for it I realized what\u2019s really going on, I finally understood why I really am feeling like this towards you.\n\n\nYou drive me crazy and you take my breath.\n\nI\u2019m always thinking about you and most of the time all that i can feel is pain.\n\nWhen we talk it\u2019s hard for me to hear you because of how strong my heart beats are.\n\nThat smile that you are showing him pls stop it!\nIt\u2019s so painful for me to seeing you so close to someone else, and now i know exactly why I\u2019m like that, the reason why you can make me feel this strong feelings is because...\n\n\nI LOVE YOU !", "title": "My first love (warning: its a bit long and I\u2019m sorry if it doesn\u2019t sound too much like I\u2019m really writing this to her, it\u2019s the first time i ever wrote something like this)"}, {"created_utc": 1590847832, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gtevy2/for_those_feeling_like_there_missing_connection/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello my name is Logan, I am a former drug user, self hater.

We had never met previously, yet it felt like we were long lost friends reconnecting after a decade apart. We spent the next 10 hours making sushi from scratch because we're both foodies that love cooking outside our comfort zone, and we spent the rest of the time watching Lord of the Rings while cuddling on the couch. We kissed, and although you had already had your first with someone else, I let you take mine willingly. Even now, I don't regret that my first was with you. We said our goodbyes at 11 pm because you had work in the morning, and I took the 2-hour long train ride home. All I could think about then was how perfect you were.\n\nThe next week we went back to how we normally interact with each other. A few messages a day asking about how we were doing and what we were doing. The relationship cooled down in all that time, but I had a deep love for you all the same. And yes, it was love. I did not know what it felt like previously, but there is no doubt in my mind. I love you. I love you more than anything. But as all good things must come to an end, so did we. Not because we fell out of love, or because it didn't work out. But because the timing was simply not there. We were at different stages in our lives. You had a job, an apartment; you had settled down for the foreseeable future. I was a student, living in an apartment temporarily; waiting for my undergraduate studies to start overseas. We agreed that there was no reason to continue because there was nothing in it for us long term, and that the breakup would be that much more difficult 2 months from then since a long-distance relationship would be too complicated. It was the rational choice, and you were always the rationality that kept my irrationality in check. \n\nDespite the bleak future, neither of us wanted it to end. We both wanted to continue, but the timing simply was not there. And so a promise was made. I bought a metal box and a lock, and you came over one last time. This time we didn't kiss, and we didn't cuddle. We continued watching Lord of the Rings and talked, and we made more food together. But this time it was only platonic. At the end of that night, we both wrote on a piece of paper. It simply said \"one day we will be together\" - signed by the both of us. I locked the box and gave it to you as a keepsake, while I took the key and made a necklace out of it that I carry with me every day, and every night.

Ah cierto, yo escribo esto despu\u00e9s de las 12am as\u00ed que hoy ser\u00eda S\u00e1bado. Pero esto pas\u00f3 el Viernes (29/05), horas despu\u00e9s de mi primera historia.\n\n\u2764\ufe0fEn la ma\u00f1ana como siempre saludo a J con un buenos d\u00edas. Ten\u00edamos tareas por hacer y una clase a las 11:30am asi que ambos fuimos a comer el desayuno y regresamos a esa hora para la clase. Estuvimos bien y todo iba normal.\n\nEn la tarde a las 4pm ella me llama junto a otros chicos y chicas de mi sal\u00f3n. Estuvimos hablando por una hora. Luego colgu\u00e9 porque ten\u00eda tarea que hacer para ayer mismo. Le dije que ten\u00eda que avanzar y ella comprendi\u00f3.\n\nJ es algo perezosa, pero a la vez responsable. Nos pusimos a hablar sobre las tareas que ten\u00edamos que hacer para los siguientes d\u00edas. Nos preocupamos un poco, pero seguimos avanzando. J me dijo que quer\u00eda ver Netflix conmigo m\u00e1s tarde, a lo cual yo acept\u00e9. En cuanto terminara de orar (Pertenezco a una religi\u00f3n junto a mi familia y hacemos un culto en las noches) ver\u00edamos una serie. Cuando regres\u00e9 de orar, J me escribi\u00f3 algo cortante y me dijo que no quer\u00eda hablar con nadie en ese momento. Supuse que se sent\u00eda mal, y para no molestarla le dije que no se preocupe, que la iba a entender.\n\nLuego de 30min, J me escribi\u00f3 diciendo que ya no podr\u00eda seguir hablandome m\u00e1s. Que sus padres se lo hab\u00edan prohibido y que ella lo sent\u00eda. A lo cual me sent\u00ed mal al instante, porque ya me hab\u00eda hecho ilusi\u00f3n con ella y no aceptaba dejarle de hablar. Cuando de pronto ella se enoj\u00f3 por mi frialdad al respondele frente a lo que pasaba. \n\nMe dej\u00f3 de hablar.\n\nLe dije a mi mejor amiga (Vamos a llamarle C) que me sent\u00eda super mal. Y me respondi\u00f3: \u00bfQu\u00e9 pas\u00f3?. Le cont\u00e9 todo, quer\u00eda hacer una llamada con ella, pero estaba ocupada. Estaba llorando y no dejaba de pensar en J.\n\nYo cuando me siento mal, empiezo a escribir alguna carta sobre reflexi\u00f3n o cosa similar para calmarme. Cuando de pronto me escribe J a decirme que todo era broma.\n\nYo no sab\u00eda c\u00f3mo reaccionar. No pod\u00eda creerlo. Me dijo que se hab\u00eda pasado de cruel y que lo sent\u00eda. La perdon\u00e9 y empez\u00f3 a preguntarme sobre qu\u00e9 hab\u00eda pensado y c\u00f3mo me sent\u00eda. Me porte muy sentimental con ella hasta que ambos nos tranquilizamos.\n\nHasta que mencion\u00f3 algo que me dej\u00f3 pensando hasta ahora. J me dijo que en un tiempo cuando termine esto, ella viajar\u00e1 a otro pa\u00eds por su religi\u00f3n durante 2 a\u00f1os. Tengo miedo de que conozca a otra persona, pero tampoco puedo obligarla a que no vaya. Ella me dice que haremos videollamadas as\u00ed como ahora lo hacemos, pero igual tengo miedo. Espero que si ella se va a otro lugar no se enamore de otro chico, la verdad es que me encari\u00f1\u00e9 mucho con ella y a veces pienso que ella es con la que quiero vivir toda mi vida.\n\nCierro esto diciendo: \u00bfQu\u00e9 opinan?.

But it means I can feel again, and I just had to remind myself she was there, even if at a distance. I couldn't though, I needed her, and guess what? She was there.\n\nPURE RELIEF, AND PURE LOVE!!! &lt;3\nMy heart was racing, I was so anxious I couldn't sleep. She calms me down immediately. 7 hours later it's 7 in the morning.

But aside from that I'll start with an  introduction I am Aiden Barton I dont mind giving out my name because I allready accidentally made it my username as a rookie mistake, but I am now a 1st year in highschool. \n\n     And this story begins about 7 to 8 years ago in C.O I was attending a small elementary school the first part of the school's name was Aspen but i probably should not say the last part for privacy sake . But if this friend see this she'll know what school I'm talking about. \n\n     But As I was new to this school due to family issues causing me to transfer I met \"Madi\" witch is her nickname and although this sounds like a cringy romance at the time I fell for her. And I was 95% sure she like me too, but each day we would walk home together and  talk like no other in the classroom, and sometimes would get caught passing notes to each other, keep in mind I was in elementary school so.. I was a little cheesy.\n\n   But me and my small friend group at the time witch  was Lucas, the athlete of the group, David the brains, #FYI he was able to solve a rubix cube when he was like 6\" and me. But of course like any romance story there is a rival and for me it was lucas..  So with me and madi talking constantly it also may have been my fault he hated me behind my back. \n\n   I suppose the reason why was he too was in love with madi, and of course me so heads over heels for her. I didnt even notice or care. But I wasn't dumb enough not to see he was trying to flirt with her. And I as the comedian in the group, would often play out his attempts of flirting with her as a joke. So any thing he would say to her from \"hey that blue crayon reminds me of your eyes\" to \"my mom said you where pretty and I agreed\" I would often play as a joke like  \"good one lucas, you're sounding like how my dad talks to my mom\" looking back on it I would hate me too for doing stuff like that instead of telling him face to face I like her. \n\n  Anyways this continued for 3/4 of the year,  /me and madi even held hands to home at that point\ud83d\ude33\\  until the day my dad suddenly decided to pick me up. Keep in mind my house was about 5 minutes away from the school and I walked everyday. So this was a surprise to me.sm And as a wave my friends goodbye and entered the car about half way home we take a hard right. And our house was to to the left of the crossing of the school. And me being curious I asked where we were going... and he sat there in silence staring down the road for what felt like eternity then spoke to me in the most monotone voice I've ever heard him speak, \"We moved\" at first I thought he misspoken what he mean but i could see no attempt in emotion in his face at the time. I still dont know why maybe to act like very thing was fine... or to try and make it seem like a good thing. But that didnt change how hard the words hit me. \n\n   And I hate my self because at this time I wanted so desperately tell him about madi and  that day how we told each other we liked the other. But no matter how hard I wanted to I just couldn't. I sat I'm the back seat In silence not questioning not crying, nothing, I know I should have at the time to help release the shock but I didnt. I sat thinking about Her, lucas, David and how they would most likely never know why I didnt tell them I was leaving. Why I abandoned them. \n\n   Over the next few years it hard to explain but i dont remember anything after that until 5th grade. my parents would often tell me from time to time about how great this therapist I saw was but I have no memory of ever going to therapy. Or even learning anything in school for that fact. It's like I lost 3 years worth of memory. \n\n  Of course I didnt say anything to my parent because who the hell would believe and 10 year old say he cant remember anything from the past 3 years... and here I am now still unaware of what happend to make me go to therapy or what I leard from 3rd grade to 5th. I dont even know why I am writing this right now maybe for composure that some day madi will read this and I would talk to her about life. Or if it's out of desperation to apologize to my friends that i left behind without saying a word goodbye... but that my story even though maybe 1 person is going to read this it makes me feel better to at least put this out there for her.", "title": "Finding an old flame."}, {"created_utc": 1590737281, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gso906/i_love_him_but_not_the_same_way_anymore/", "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have been dating my boyfriend for a while and things are good and we've been fine with a few hiccups here and there but nothing we couldn't fix.

I was a junior in college before I felt ready to have sex, so it's not like I didn't have plenty of time to do my research. Of course, my first time did come with a couple of surprises.\n\nFor starters, I had to hop on top just to get it in, and for some reason, I didn't bleed at all until the second time I had sex. Fortunately, though, I was well-informed, and I knew I would need my first sexual partner to warm me up with his lips and fingers before we got to the main event. I knew that even after plenty of foreplay,\u00a0having penetrative sex for the first time\u00a0would still probably hurt. I knew my then-partner and I were going to have to go slow, douse my vagina with lube, and have non-expired condoms at the ready. Plus, since I was the last person in my friend group to get laid, I knew from their experiences that, typically, girls only\u00a0orgasm during first-time sex\u00a0in books and movies.  \nWhat I\u00a0didn't\u00a0know before I had sex\u00a0was this:\u00a0Having sex for the first time\u00a0shouldn't make you feel like you're losing anything, and it definitely shouldn't make you feel like you're bound for life to the first person you have sex with. Unfortunately, thanks largely to my deeply religious upbringing, society's tendency to slut-shame women from girlhood, and my own insecurities, I placed way too much value on my first time.\n\nDon't get me wrong \u2014 I think I'll always look back on my first sexual experience with a man fondly, but there are still a few things I wish I'd known before I had sex.\n\n**1. Losing Your Virginity Doesn\u2019t Mean You're Losing Value**  \nI grew up in a fundamentalist Christian home, so I was raised to place an unhealthy amount of value on my virginity. I was told by my parents and Sunday school teachers alike that my virginity was a \"precious gift,\" and that it was my responsibility to save myself for my future husband. In high school,\u00a0my parents even gave me a purity ring\u00a0\u2014 which I reluctantly wore \u2014 to remind me that \"true love waits.\"\n\nFortunately, none of this kept me from enjoying my first time. By the time I finally decided to have sex at 21, I had mostly abandoned my religious upbringing, so I didn't feel an ounce of guilt about having sex outside of the covenant of holy matrimony. I did, however, feel like I'd lost a valuable piece of myself. A part of me, however small, worried that I'd made myself less desirable in some way, and I really wish I hadn't felt that way.\n\nI mean,\u00a0having sex for the first time\u00a0is\u00a0kind of a big deal for most people, and that's not bad or unnatural. Unfortunately, most girls, whether they grew up in a religious home or not, are raised to think of their virginity primarily in the context of how it can please other people. We're taught to think of our virginity as though it doesn't belong to us \u2014 as if anyone we sleep with after we're \"deflowered\" is being robbed of something they could have had. Sadly, this widespread, cross-cultural mentality often shines a negative light on what should be a very positive experience.\n\n**2. Missionary Isn\u2019t Always The Best Position To Start Off In**  \nI don't know if it's because missionary is such a basic sex position \u2014 or if it's because most film scenes featuring heterosexual deflowering show young couples in the missionary position \u2014 but I assumed my first time would be less painful if my ex and I started off that way. It wasn't.\n\nAfter a few extremely painful minutes of trying to have sex in the missionary position, my ex suggested that I get on top of him so gravity could help us out. I thought literally sitting on his penis would only make things more painful for me, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it actually made things so much easier for both of us. It still hurt, but not as much as missionary had \u2014 plus, being on top allowed me to feel more in control of the situation.\u00a0I would definitely recommend girl-on-top\u00a0to any virgins reading this.\n\n**3. Losing Your Virginity To Someone Doesn't Mean You're Bound To Them For Life**  \n[Read More...](https://www.psychicloki.com/2020/05/6-things-i-wish-id-known-before-i-had.html)", "title": "6 Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Had Sex For The First Time"}, {"created_utc": 1590719811, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gskcn7/have_you_seen_this/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "have you seen this"}, {"created_utc": 1590713175, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gsinyl/being_kissed_while_youre_asleep_is_one_of_the/", "num_comments": 35, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "BEING KISSED WHILE YOU\u2019RE ASLEEP IS ONE OF THE MOST PUREST FORMS OF LOVE !!\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96"}, {"created_utc": 1590712912, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gsill8/people_ask_me_how_the_world_will_end_all_i_know/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "PEOPLE ASK ME HOW THE WORLD WILL END, ALL I KNOW IS THAT MINE WILL WHEN YOU LEAVE !!! \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96"}, {"created_utc": 1590710382, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/gshwpt/quarantine_gift/", "num_comments": 8, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!

He is a lonely father of teenage girl. At work all his behavior indicaded that he is interested in me but he is kinda shy and we only had a few small talks. I was moving (1 hour away) and on the last day of my work i gave him my email with note that i  like him and want to get to know him better. He is sexualy attracted to me and intriguing because he was persistent in deep eye contact and he seems to be different than other guys. He wrote me back I visited him and he took me to a hike to the woods. We spent great time, we both introverts, artistic souls and have similar interests. We didn\u2019t kissed though i wanted that and i feel he wanted that too. We decide to meet again, he told me that he wanted to invite me to his house but is messy there today, so next time. Unfortunately he doesnt have a car to even meet me halfway. After our meeting he wrote me that he is looking forward to hang out with me again. We decided to contact only through email and he usually answer after 2 days. We are busy at work so it\u2019s working for him and for me too. I answered that we can hang out again on Thursday (one week after 1 meeting) because this is only one his day off. He answered that he would like that but we didn\u2019t set up any hour and place. I wrote him day before but he didn\u2019t answer and Stupid inpatient me decided to drive there anyway. I wanted to meet with my female friend as well to do not waste time there in case he wont check the email. When i was in town i wrote him that i will be in the same place and time like one week ago and if he doesn\u2019t check the email i\u2019m going to meet that girl and will be in town until evening if he wants to hang out. He didn\u2019t showed up and while i was with her he apologized and wrote that sth came  up and he doesn\u2019t know when he finish but he will stay in touch. I was pretty sad but i understand when someone is busy.I probaby was to pushy.  2 days after that i wrote that this it\u2019s fine because we didn\u2019t set up any certain hour and i wanted to meet with my friend anyway. It\u2019s been a week of silence. I don\u2019t know if i did sth wrong and he don\u2019t want to spend time with me anymore or if its push/pull stupid game or if i was too inpatient.
