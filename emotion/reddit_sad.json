One day her account unfriended me from outta nowhere, it later friended me back and asked me to tell her who I am. Later another account added me, the account messaged me saying it was her brother and to try get onto his sister (the girl i was talking to) because her ex was looking for her and had her location cos he logged onto her snap. Then both accounts unfriended me and that was the last time I heard from her. I stayed friends with her account even tho I couldn't talk to her, sometimes I would go back and read our old conversations, and listen to her voice recordings, I thought one day I might try unfriend her account, so I did, I search for her user name to find out she deactivated her account. since this happened it has consumed me. I cry myself to sleep nearly every night, I miss her so much, I don't have a reason to wake up anymore, I don't have a reason to smile. But recently during quarentine I started a YouTube channel to try get myself out of the mess I was in, I was having alot of fun with it and I enjoyed seeing people laugh at jokes I was making. Then a guy who has been harassing me online reported my newest video I uploaded today, it got taken down for inappropriate content, my channel has been completely messed up, all my videos have been age restricted and my channel doesn't even show up when you search for it, nor do any of my videos. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like my life has nothing going for it, I'm 16, I have no friends, I don't go to school, I don't have a job and I feel like death is upon me. That might sound like a weird thing to say but I haven't been well. I haven't been able to eat without throwing up, I can't even smell food without wanting to vomit. All the things I once loved in life I find no joy in, I like to collect coins and go metal detecting, as well as play video games, but I can't find joy in any of them anymore, I used to love to play guitar, I've been playing it for years, but I have no desire to even pick it up anymore.

She\u2019ll think every girl can see what she sees in you.\n\nShe\u2019s scared of the dark sometimes, she has nightmares, bad ones. Hold her. Hold her so tight, stroke her hair, kiss her forehead, and don\u2019t sleep without lingering your arm around her limbs, please don\u2019t let her go.\n\nShe has a sense of humour you\u2019ll never find in anybody else. She\u2019s so funny, a dark and honest humour that will make you laugh until your stomach hurts. She\u2019ll love to laugh, make her laugh. She throws her head back and her hair brushes off her shoulders and her eyes light up so bright it\u2019s indescribable, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nShe\u2019s insecure, heartbreakingly so.

She didn\u2019t give me one. I didn\u2019t deserve one but I\u2019ll never stop wishing I got one. At every opportunity, kiss her in the street, buy her flowers (she loves orchids), dance with her at parties and don\u2019t break her heart. Please don\u2019t break her heart.

I am an org member in school. I always do everything I can to make my parents proud even if it means I have to push it through my limits sometimes.\n\nBut sadly, my family always forgets who I am.\n\nDespite of being a good child and a responsible student, they always suspect me of being the bad one. And honestly, it hurts when parents says something about you that does not define you.\n\nHonestly my home, doesn't feel like it used to anymore. Everyday, it felt like living with strangers who always scream at you. Sometimes, I have to cry in the bathroom because I couldn't take it anymore. And sometimes, I cry myself to sleep, thinking how my parents couldn't appreciate what I always do for them.\n\nI have good grades but my mom and dad would always question why I couldn't make it higher. When I couldn't make it to the nationals (in a competition) , my mom and dad would laugh at me, saying that I only wasted my time because they said that they knew I would not make it. When I have to deal with the school orgs, they would always say that it will only be a hindrance in my studying.\n\nEven if I don't have an idea what does it feel to party with friends because I haven't done that, they would always suspect me of doing it.\n\nHonestly, I'm very tired of dealing with my parents but heaven knows how much I love them.\n\nI can't do the things I really want to do because they would always say I should do things that would really make sense. So whenever I would try to paint, I would hide so that my mom wouldn't be mad at me.\n\nI feel like a trophy for them because I can't fail. If I did, they would always remind me of what others will say to them.\n\nHonestly, it's so draining but I can't even do anything about it because I have no choice.\n\nSo to all the parents ou there, I hope you would always ask your child if they're okay or if they were hurt whenever you demand something they cannot do. Many says that I just don't understand it because I'm still not a parent but why does it have to hurt like this? Parents were once a child of their parents too. I hope no one is experiencing what I'm going through.\n\nTo be honest, I've been thinking of hurting myself but I am afraid of what would others say to my parents or what would others say abt how my parent raised me. I don't want people to blame them. I've been holding myself for years but I don't really know how long could I take this. Family was supposed to be my safest haven and comfort but sadly, it is where I got my deepest heartbreaks. Please parents, ask your child how they feel about your parenting sometimes so they wouldn't be hurt like I do with my family. It's sad and I don't want others to experience this kind of sadness.\n\nAll I want is a hug right now and some assurance that all of this would be okay. My parents never hug me or comforted me so I'm longing for something I did not experience at all. Although they are not hurting me physically, I just can't take the mental and emotional stress anymore.\n\nSorry for the bad English.

When we got to the museum my mood got better and I was looking at her, staring at her beautiful eyes while holding her soft hands. I wish I could feel that again, she was smiling and laughing throughout our whole museum tour, little did she know that I was talking to myself about how lucky I am that I'm with this woman, I remember every single detail about that museum, the way she talked about the art, the way she laughed when I almost fell down the stairs, and the way I admired her more than the art around me. I had an anxiety attack later that evening, I sat down in the sea side near the museum, I was smoking a cigarette and watching the sunset. I didn't tell her where I was at that moment because she was with her friends, I've been wanting to jump in the sea just to kill myself and end the pain but suddenly she called and told me she's worried and wants to see me at that moment. I told her where I was and she was there beside me, my heart was pounding like hell and my thoughts were running through my mind like a waterfall, everything hurts but when I'm with her everything feels so different.

It still blows my mind I did that.\n\nMy mum passed away on the 5th of November, skip forward a few weeks too the first week of December and I went into school after having some time off because grief and depression finally kicked in after the funeral, I went in because I wanted to see my friends and maybe take my mind off things.\n\nI got to my form class and my form tutor informed us that we had an assembly that morning, as we was walking and talking on our way to the assembly hall, one of higher ups of the school pulled me aside and said \"Hey, Jake how've you been?\" I said \"I've been better but thanks for asking.\" \n\"Okay, okay. Listen, I don't know how to say this but the assembly today features a performance that might hit close to home a little, you don't have to sit through it.\" I sort of shrugged it off and said \"Nah, it can't be that bad, I just wanna sit with my friends if that's okay.\" \n\nI sat next to my buddy Ethan and the assembly started. Little did I know that the performance was a about a young boy who had lost his mother before Christmas and had a the mother being portrayed as a ghost trying to talk to the son and try to hug him but the son can't see or hear her.\n\nMy friends looked at me in shock and I was sat there frozen in disbelief, knowing the type of teenager I was I'm still surprised to this day that I didn't storm out of that assembly hall, shouting and swearing at every teacher and trying to find out whose bright idea it was. \n\nI understand the message it was trying to send but I found it incredibly insensitive especially when every teacher was made aware of what had happened to me recently.\n\nIt's been almost 10 years since that happened and it still baffles me.", "title": "A Sad Story."}, {"created_utc": 1597794761, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/iccpo7/im_sad/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "i forgot what it's like to be truly happy and i feel like i have no one to talk to", "title": "i'm sad"}, {"created_utc": 1597793640, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/icce5u/i_dont_know/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I don\u2019t know"}, {"created_utc": 1597793243, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/icca7o/feels/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Feels"}, {"created_utc": 1597793085, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/icc8o3/i_feel_lonely_at_school/", "num_comments": 8, "score": 1, "selftext": "I feel like crying but my tears wont drop, Im so sad like a polar bear.

To my ex boyfriend, if you somehow stumble upon this last post before I leave to heal, make sure to show this to your future new girl because I want her to know how much I have faith in her already.\n\n\nTo the Next Girl that will love him:\n\nTo the next girl that will love him \u2014 love him with kindness, patience and understanding. The kind that doesn\u2019t overwhelm him but isn\u2019t fleeting, the kind that is not suffocating but reassuring, the kind that is concerned for him, but not dotting. He likes his dog so much, loves even, make sure that you take care of him as well. He likes his Star Wars and he has it on everything: his smartphone, his shirt, even his underwear. He likes the Football Club and Miley Cyrus and might dedicate one of their songs to you. He will send you videos of himself peeing, pooping and farting and although it's disgusting, you will come to love this side of him as well. He likes to tease you for every single thing; from your cooking to your weird habits. He's very competitive and will look for anything to compete with. He likes his scarf and would not go outside without it. He likes to adopt kids in the future because he has so much love in him that he could give. Name your children Sam Francis or Ruby, because a selfish part of me is hoping that he might tell them about me one day. Green is the color of his eyes and although I did not know this before because his eyes changed colors everytime \u2014 make sure to remind him that it's beautiful nonetheless. Curly were his hairs before his Alopecia humbled him down. Don't frustrate him or his Tourette's Syndrome will kick in and you will give him tics without meaning to. He has a condition that gives him difficulty to smell, so you will have to be his nose. He has ADHD, that makes him complicated but extremely creative. Sometimes his intentions don't align with his words and sometimes he gets lost on his own world that it may disappoint you. Fear not for these are all just the perks of loving someone special. If you love him, you will allow yourself to be burdened. By the time you would know eachother, he might have moved in to his new apartment, or he might still have lived under the same roof with his ex girlfriend for 6 years \u2014 be wary of her. She is nothing but a mere distant forethought on his mind and yet her power over him is great. She's like a black hole, always consuming the light he would give out and there is no escape. Unlike me, you need to fight it and make him feel like he's not alone. Build friend relationships with his brothers because he doesn't want to admit it, but he holds those two dear in his heart. In the future, maybe he'll introduce you to his nana, the one person he loves the most, even more than himself. Always treasure her just as he treasures her like a prized jewel. Never make him doubt, never make him jealous, I suppose a little light banter is ok but at your discretion. Never give up, because unlike me, I know you have more fighting spirit. He deserves to be fought for. He likes to bottle things up and likes to be left alone, I suppose you can give him space but never let him deal with his struggles alone. There are so many things I still want to say but the wounds are fresh and unclean and my heart bleeds everytime I think about him for more than a minute. He is a part of my life \u2014 I see him in the Morning Glories that bloom outside my window, I smell him in the aftershave that my dad uses, I hear his words in the four walls of my room and I feel his embrace blanketing me during solitude and isolation. I may never get the explanation I deserve or why he decided to leave me hanging and naked \u2014 but I entrust this part of my life to you. You will know it the moment you are a part of his. Play games with him, laugh with him, drink with him, build a family with him, make love to him, hug him, cuddle him, hold him, dry his silent tears \u2014 and all these things I wanted to do but couldn't. To the next girl who will love him, my faith for you is strong and genuine. To the next girl who will love him, I entrust him to you and I entrust the future. And I'm hoping he will love you even more than he has loved me. Trust him, build him, be his foundation. Grieve, have fun, be serious. Cry, laugh, feel butterflies. Share his emotions. He is more than his ADHD, he is more than his flaws, love him like he is a part of you, give the best that you can but don't give everything, because if you do, what more do you have left for yourself? To the next girl, love him just as much as I did, if not more. And that's saying something because I loved him so much it hurt me. Do this, and you will have the most amazing man in your life.", "title": "A message to one girl I haven't met, yet I have faith in so much already"}, {"created_utc": 1597760805, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/ic1zad/_/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szw6ltbntrh51.png?width=555&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbcf59564be70a386f242e7be8a2141529375a07", "title": ":'("}, {"created_utc": 1597760421, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/ic1v6m/wish_someone_look_at_me_like_this/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Wish someone look at me like this"}, {"created_utc": 1597753855, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/ic03jw/my_childhood_just_went_out_with_a_pop/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "My childhood just went out with a pop"}, {"created_utc": 1597752091, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/ibzoih/i_cant_control_my_mind/", "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "selftext": "Everything I decide I\u2019m going to do or not do I change constantly.

I just need to let my emotions flow and share the story of the cat who changed me, and who changed my life. I cry every day about him and am crying as I type this.\n\nJust over 2 years ago, my family adopted a cat. He was born with a deformation in his arm that made it so he crawled everywhere. Poor little guy just had to army crawl, but man he had heart. He had dedication. He had motivation. Since he army crawled, we named him after our Army Recruiter at my high school: Sgt Byers the Army Cat. Over the course of a couple months, I grew attached to him and my mom told me I could take him as my own. He was my cat then. I would come home from school every day and he would be sitting at the door waiting for me. Over the time I had him, he overcame so much. [His arm](https://imgur.com/a/8tHTF7q) straightened out. He became the [climber of all climbers ](https://imgur.com/a/wQsFYtl). He had so much heart in him. He pushed through all he struggled. Then my sister moved out. She has a cat, Thomas, who she didn\u2019t want to be left alone while she was at work. I let her take Byers with her, as Thomas and Byers always played and got along. One day I went and stayed the night at her place and I wanted to hold Byers. He would always let me pick him up. He would always let me cuddle him, so it was okay. I picked him up and started petting him, and he scratched my arm. I got upset with him because he\u2019s never done that. This was the last memory I had with him. We left her house a few moments after that. A few weeks after, I found out he wasn\u2019t doing well. He wasn\u2019t eating or drinking much. He wouldn\u2019t socialize with Thomas. He wasn\u2019t himself. We knew something was wrong and we decided we would have to bring him to the vet and put him to rest. The night before we were going to do that (January 23rd) my sister and her boyfriend had to rush him to our house because he was in really bad condition. They all came in my room. Byers was in my mom\u2019s room resting. My sister\u2019s boyfriend told me \u201cI did everything I could. I\u2019m sorry, [LegionnaireFrog].\u201d I understood this to mean that he was sorry I couldn\u2019t have more time. I fell asleep crying, because I knew the next day I would have to say goodbye to the friend I held so dearly. I woke up the next morning and got ready to bring Byers to the vet and say goodbye. I walked out of my room and saw my dad.\n\nI asked him \u201cWhere\u2019s Byers?\u201d\nHe said \u201cWhat do you mean, buddy?\u201d\nI repeated \u201cWhere\u2019s Byers?\u201d\nHe said \u201cBuddy... he\u2019s gone. He died on the way here in the truck last night. Your mom took him to get cremated this morning.\u201d\n\nI was wrong... he wasn\u2019t in my mom\u2019s room. He was gone... I never got to say goodbye. I went to sleep that night and had a nightmare. We had a cat, Cooper, that we had to put to rest a few years ago. I was holding his paw when they injected him and remember saying \u201cGoodbye, Cooper\u201d through sobs. My dream was that memory, but I looked away and looked back and was holding Byers\u2019s paw.\n\nI never knew what was wrong with him. I never will. I have his ashes and whiskers in my room. I wrote a poem in memory of him too:\n\nWhen at the door you\u2019d come to greet me,\nI felt as though nothing else could beat me.\nYou showed to me that you were there\nAnd showed a love that couldn\u2019t compare\nA friend is all I could have wished for\nAnd yet you went and gave me more \nYou satisfied my one desire\nAnd in doing that, my heart was set afire.\nThat burning love shall never go out\nNow with my love, I needn\u2019t pout\nBut if my love alone could save you,\nA million times over your life would shine true,\nFor this love will reach forever to my core.\nThis love grows greater and greater, more and more\nThis love is for you, my best friend.\nI shall hold this love, until my life does too end. \nOf the many memories that I recall,\nI know for certain: you were the best of all.\n\nWhen we adopted him, we thought we would be changing his life... instead, he changed us. He changed me so much. I\u2019ve changed for the better, but... as a result of the worst.\n\nGoodbye, Byers. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t tell you it myself...

Yeah, he was stubborn and uncompromising when it came to test results, and gave out homework that most of us felt was tedious, but deep down I felt pity for him. Even I, who as well has had some disagreements with markings, felt sorry. He was pretty much outcasted and borderline despised by na\u00efve students who got the short end of the stick. I felt it wasn\u2019t really his fault, but instead, theirs for not being as bright a light bulb. This man was like Google in the flesh. He had a shit ton of random knowledge stored inside his head, which made you wonder 1) how he knew those things 2) why he knew those things 3) and if he was even human. But, he was in fact very human; it\u2019s why he's not here anymore. The worst part about it, is that I don\u2019t believe he was content or remotely satisfied with his life. Perhaps he was so stubborn, because he was holding to what little power he had in the world. If I recall correctly his family life and relations weren\u2019t the best either; I believe he told me even his family had problems with him, but I\u2019m not too certain of this memory. But one thing I do remember is that I was supposed to visit him after I graduated, but hadn\u2019t got around to it even though I had the time. I was waiting until I \u201cfelt like it\u201d which was pretty fucking stupid. I even suggested the idea of going to the beach together or something (even though he's like 40 years older than me), as I'm not sure he had many friends at all. The one story that he\u2019s contrived inside my head, is that the job or career you start with is unlikely to be your last. He stated that most people switch careers multiple times, so your start is not likely to be your end. He was a biology teacher who had first studied in medicine or something to get inducted into a lab, but later found out that the job wasn't for him because he realized that he wasn't fond of blood. Perhaps I felt such a bond with him, because I too was pretty much an outcast. I still am one haha, but it\u2019s not something I'd be ashamed about. It's who I am.\n\nAs a teacher, he was alright, but as a person, I thought he was quite interesting. I thought he was a strong character, for having to go through 60-ish years trapped in this city. He had some axolotls that required a considerable amount of attention, as well as some plants he was growing. That to me is pretty much symbolic of his love for life, and to have his life taken from him, whilst not being content (at least in my thoughts)? It's simply unbearable. I am not happy with his passing and I am not satisfied with the kind of life we live. My dog also was put down a day before I heard the news about this. If I had the money- no, if everyone had the money, to become financially free and capable of doing anything that they might want to do? Maybe then I'd be happy, but I'm telling you, right now, I'm not.

I'm the only one who knows the truth- on Thursday I had a severe mental breakdown. It unraveled over a year of hard work on my part. I think my heart may have been bled dry.\n\nAround two years ago (a few months after my dad passed away) I had an epiphany of sorts, which was that I love everybody unconditionally. I even love the people who I don't know, and the people who have wronged me. At the time it felt like a blessing, but not it feels like a curse- I overextend myself to the extreme. There's only one person I don't love, and it's myself. I've been trying for over a year to learn to love myself, but the farthest I've gotten is the ability to tolerate myself.\n\nEverything kinda fell apart around me when I met Sweetheart. She was perfect. She told me everyday that she loved me, and soon enough I started believing it. Everyday it felt like my heart was racing with happiness and love. I made a list of all the things I wanted to do with her- I wanted to take her to the places I hadn't been to ever since my dad died. I wanted to take her on picnics. I wanted to get cozy by the fire on winter nights and hold her until we both fell asleep.\n\nThen I found out she had a boyfriend. That's when I lost it. The mental breakdown wasn't even just about Sweetheart, it probably would've happened regardless, but Sweetheart made me realize something: I was put on Earth to love others, but I wasn't put here to be loved.\n\nSomeday I just want to be told I'm enough. The words I really want to hear are \"I can tell how much you loved her\", because I loved her with everything I had in me. I don't know if I'll ever be able to love again the same way. I know for certain nobody will ever love me like I thought she did.\n\nVery few people in my life know that I haven't been doing well mentally, none of them know the full truth. They all tell me I'm strong. I'm not strong- I'm fighting for my life over here. I feel like a stranger in my own body. It feels like I'm being laughed at by the universe, like this is my punishment for trying.

We\u2019ve talked slightly about it and he doesn\u2019t have to tell me he\u2019s scared of death because it terrifies me too. I can just see it in his eyes, I can see how much skinnier he is, he walks with a cane because his leg has been broken in the past but is now atrophying because his body is still trying to fight the cancer, and I don\u2019t want to watch him die. But I\u2019m going to have to and I\u2019m not prepared for that at all I\u2019m going to miss his dumbass so much and I\u2019m terrified because I don\u2019t want him to die alone because I know how much it scares him.

I feel like I\u2019m never going to amount to anything, not even in the sense of fame since I don\u2019t want that but in the sense of like, I feel like I\u2019m never going to have a job that\u2019s good enough to let me live comfortably or make me feel fulfilled. I\u2019ve dropped out of university twice, to be fair, both were mental health related and before I transitioned but I feel like I\u2019ll never be successful or have any one like think \u2018wow, she\u2019s got her shit together\u2019. I got decent-ish grades at school, lots of As and stuff but at A Level there\u2019s a couple of bad grades I got that really I feel like haunt me, and it sucks because they were in subjects I wasn\u2019t really passionate about. Mainly because the teachers kinda hated me in both but I wished I did other subjects, continued with languages instead of trying science at that level. I love maths, in fact I want to do a degree in that when I go back to university, I loved doing philosophy albeit I dropped out of a course for that due to needing to transition before I could even think about going back to uni, but I wished I kept going with languages as a teenager, I did french and Spanish and loved both. I\u2019m trying to get back into them and having fun but anyway, yeah. \n\nI feel insecure af about my appearance and my social skills. People tend to like me, and generally see me as a woman (if you couldn\u2019t tell I\u2019m trans), but I feel like overlooked because I\u2019m quite quiet, and I feel like an ugly woman (I mean you could look through my post history if you really wanted to see). I feel like no-one ever really is interested in me or really thinks they\u2019d like to know me better as a friend and it just sucks. I feel really lonely because like even \u2018friends\u2019 I do have seem to so hang out with others before they would me and I\u2019ve even had them talk about what a great time they had at places when I wasn\u2019t even invited or notified that something was going on. Not to mention covid means I can\u2019t see anyone even if I wanted to.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ll die without ever having anyone. I can\u2019t have children because I can\u2019t carry children, thanks to being trans. I\u2019ve only ever kissed two people and this was when I was really drunk. I feel like I\u2019m really unattractive so no-one will ever show interest in me and even if they did, like, I\u2019m pre-op trans so it\u2019s like you know, a load of people won\u2019t even bother when I have that down there and it\u2019s like I\u2019m going to get rejected for something that frankly I really don\u2019t want. I feel touch starved, like I want to be able to have a bf or gf and actually be in love with someone and have it be reciprocated but I\u2019m 22 and I\u2019ve never had a relationship or even been intimate with anyone beyond just kissing. \n\nIdk I just feel like my life sucks and I really hate it. I feel like I\u2019ve done nothing with my life apart from get okay grades, work part-time in retail, and undergo transition.

It makes sense I was toxic and not mature enough for someone like her. I want to care for her still, I really do care about her so much.

I'd do what she did to, im happy she was able to leave the relationship she didn't feel loved in. I did so much for her. I did so much for her but I was never strong enough to shut my mouth or let something be. I had to be competitive or hot headed or butthurt like a bitch. Its just pain at this point. I love her so much and hearing her be sad crushes me and makes me want to reach out to her. This part of my brain always tells me the worst things and this part of my heart aches so badly it feels like it'll burst. She was genuinly perfect with all her flaws, and I wanted to be the one to help her through it all. In the end I was a pathetic loser who hurt the one he loved most. I hate that about myself. I wish I could rip that part of me out no matter how painful or long the process. I poured my soul and being into it and still fucked it up for myself. I dont understand why I did. It was perfect in all aspects yet I fucked up because it was my nature to just not let things go or to not say something. My friends tell me im a good person if blunt or rough but I dont feel that. I feel like a fucking monster. I hurt everyone I love no matter how much love I have for them. Its disgustingly toxic of me but I dint do it on purpose. I know im a fuck up and I know ruined everything but I just want to hold her hand again. Hear her speak about her hobbies and interests again. Plan trips to places we want to visit. Plan to move in together and split rent. Hear her cute laugh and feel her warmth as we hug. Theres nothing I want more on earth than just one more chance. I'd spend a year in hell for an hour of the past to come back. I'd kill for a moment with her like we used to be. There's nothing I wouldn't guve to spend time with her how we used to. There's nothing but an aching painful hole in me and its her shape and size. Memes that remind me of her, smells and foods that remind me of her. Streets and cars that reminds me of her. I stopped doing so many things after she left because the pain would make me sob for hours. People tell me im a good person and shes in the wrong but thats just not true. She didn't abuse me or manipulate me to love her like this, I genuinly feel like this because how amazing and fucking cool she was. She was my role model. My best friend. My closest friend. I went to her for guidance. While I had my head in her lap she played with my hair and told me advice. Now simply thinking of those times makes me feel like I'm spinning and crashing down. I have a persona to keep up but with her I let it all go. I had nothing to hide from her. But now I feel like I cant even look in her direction. I cant speak with her my voice just won't come up. I start feeling the pain and dizziness and aches eat at me and it feels like im going to passout. I love her to death, I genuinly mean I'd protect her withe my life. I'd give everything for her. She encouraged me to be healthier get better hobbies and go to college. She enwcouraanged me to stay on track with classes and gave me little kisses that she made me hunch down for since she couldn't reach. Losing her is the biggest regret of my life. I genuinly feel pure pain when I think of going near her. I can rekindle a false friendship with her. But it'll never be like how it was the years before we dated. She'll never be a true friend anymore.  The sainking feeling like im wading through sludge and much and grime feels like im drowning in my own toxicity. I feel like it was divine punishment or something that I lose someone so amazingly amazing. I dont have the vocabulary to describe how I think of her. Im lost. I feel like half of me is missing. Like my lungs were taken. Like my heart doesn't know why it beats. I would have killed myself but that wouldn't solve anything and itd bring pain to my family my friends and her. She says she cares about me when I told her about the gun in my drawer with a bullet chambered. Her telling me that made me sell the gun. I cant think about killing myself now. I have college courses to attend to, and promises toe my family to keep. If im dead I wont be able to know if everyone's safe and healthy and happy. So I stopped the suicidal thoughts even though they scratch at me I wont do those things. I've never self harmed and never considered it because she has. And if I did those scars would be permanent reminders of her on my skin. I just want a bolt of inspiration again. Something to kick me in the ass and get me out of my pity. She was that before. But now I've sunken back to how I was. Strengthened by the time I sent with her, but still a pathetic loser. Im a jealous, toxic, cock, arrogant, spoiled ,piece of shit. And she gave me the world. And I return by spitting the venom of my own pain onto her. She never deserved to be told off by me while freaking out. She never deserved to have her mood killed by me being an asshole. She never deserved the horrible things that happened to her in her past. I never deserved her. I always thought she was genuinky too perfect and amazing for this world.

I thought I had many best friends through my life, but now that I analyze them, it\u2019s like \u201cwas I their best friend, or were they just my best friend?\u201d It makes me think maybe I\u2019m the problem. It doesn\u2019t help that all my life I\u2019ve struggled to make male friends. It\u2019s always made me think something was wrong with me. I thought that until I realized I am a gay male and, like the stereotypes of gay men, I only have been able to find female friends. Maybe it\u2019s because they are more compassionate or maybe just because I share similar interests with them.\n\nIn the first grade, there was a new boy in class, Tommy. We hung out everyday. I went to his birthday party and he went to mine. Obviously at 6, there\u2019s not much best friends can do together other than that. We would laugh together and honestly he was my best friend. But, one day he came to school and he told me that his dad said we can\u2019t be friends anymore because I laughed too much and I was a distraction. The next day he left the school and I never saw him again til a basketball game in 8th grade. I remember how bad it hurt me. But instead of staying focused on that, of course as a six year old you\u2019re going to go out and make more friends since as a kid it\u2019s easier. I met someone who honestly changed my life. I say that now as a 17 year old who has barely lived, but still, she made me feel loved. We did everything together from hanging out school playing \u201chouse\u201d to hanging out at her house to going to watch the Justin Bieber movie and the Lego movie for her birthdays. Her name was Julia. She was literally a foot taller than me but regardless that didn\u2019t change anything. We were best friends til 4th grade until I had to move schools because my mom got a job at a school and my parents thought it would be easier to go there. I wish I never left that school. I have never talked to her a day in my life since then and yet I still follow her on social media and think about how different my life would\u2019ve been if I never moved schools and lost contact with her. \n\nWhen I moved to the new school, it was significantly smaller and made the chances of finding a friend with common interests very harder. It didn\u2019t help that from this time til middle school boys are going to go through puberty and not want to do \u201cgirly\u201d stuff like I did. I honestly didn\u2019t have any best friends til 8th grade when I met a group of girls at a table one day and from that day on, we sat together every day. Two of the girls names were Krystana and Nathalie. However, my mom was still working at the school I went to and during this time I was discovering my sexuality and began to discover the secret world and the internet and all of its \u201cwonders.\u201d By wonders, I mean gay porn. I would watch it, but still denied that I was gay up until 2 years ago when I was 15. In middle school I wanted to deny I was gay as much as possible so I tried to avoid letting my mom see that I was hanging out with girls in fear that it would give her a clue of who I am due to stereotypes. So, the reason I brought this up is because whenever they would invite me somewhere, I would always make up an excuse because I didn\u2019t want my mom or dad to take me to meet my friends at the mall to find out I was spending the day with girls. Now that I think about it, it was ridiculous but that\u2019s just the way I thought. \n\nHigh school came and I only went to school with only two of the girls from the group, Krystana and Nathalie. Obviously in high school you are going to make new friends and friendships from middle school are going to not be as important. So in the time of us looking for new friends, we became a fell a little apart. Now, I\u2019m still at the same high school, and in all honesty, it\u2019s not helping my mental health much. Here\u2019s why: I am a gay closeted male going to a small private Catholic high school that teaches homosexual acts are wrong and there is only a small group of kids to pick friends from. I didn\u2019t choose to go to this school, my parents did. But to the best of my ability, I tried to find friends with common interests, people that cared about school and not getting caught up in the wrong crowd. During this time, I met a girl named Courtney. Through the course of freshman year, we became inseparable and I was glad to have found someone who I was able to hang out with. \n\nI thought she was my best friend, I mean, she\u2019s still my best friend to this day Junior year where I am now. However, with high school hormones all over the place, my best friend found herself a boyfriend. I was so happy for her! After all, I was the one who helped set them up together. But little did I know how much that would bring us apart. Sophomore year began and she would sit with him at lunch so I would have to go sit with some other acquaintances for the meantime. In that group of acquaintances, Krystana and Nathalie were with them. And once again, I became best friend with Krystana and Nathalie once again while trying to maintain my crumbling friendship with Courtney. I tried to get back to being best friends with Courtney again because I truly believed she was my best friend. During that time, my friendship began to crumble with Krystana and Nathalie because they thought I was hanging out with Courtney too much. Then, the pandemic hit and I never saw any of them for a full year, not until a couple of weeks ago. Throughout quarantine, they would always be hanging out with other people. They would invite me, but I said no because I didn\u2019t want to get the virus nor bring it to anyone in my family or even grandparents. So, as I sat behind my phone watching them hang out with other friends on social media, I began to realize, maybe I\u2019m not their best friends....\n\nAs the cases go down and my friends and I get our shots, I have been asking Krystana and Nathalie if they finally want to hang out, but they always say that they are busy or make up an excuses. Yet, I ended up calling them out for always hanging out with other friends and they claimed it\u2019s because I never go out with them and haven\u2019t ever wanted to go out with them since middle school (which was when I was scared my mom would suspect I was gay, not because I didn\u2019t want to.) While they were texting me that in the group chat , I was just so sad and upset that I thought it would make me feel better if I got consolation from Courtney. But it only made it worse because she told me that I should drop them for hanging out without me and making plans without me. But as I began to think about it anymore, that\u2019s exactly what Courtney was doing to me. She is always hanging out either her boyfriend and her real best friend and never asking me if I want to hang out. Sometimes I make excuses for her like I live too far, or I\u2019m a guy and she\u2019s a girl, or the fact that she has a boyfriend and I should respect their boundaries. But the thing is, I\u2019m gay. I don\u2019t want her to be my girlfriend, I just want her to be my best friend. So I\u2019m scared to ask her to lunch or something in case she gets the wrong ideas. \n\nTomorrow, I have to go to school to turn in an application for a school club, National Honors Society, and since school is optional, I asked Krystana and Nathalie if they wanted to hang out and get lunch after school. Of course they made excuses and said it was short notice and they have to get home and do homework (on a Friday night :/ ) and I called them out yet again for only being available when their other friends want to hang out. Yet again, I angrily thought about going to text Courtney, but not to my surprise, I see her hanging out with other friends on social media. The thing I was just about to complain about to her, which I know I shouldn\u2019t be gossiping about my other friends to friends but I just had to let it out to someone and I thought I could tell her but I guess not.\n\nEvery single day of high school , week day or weekend, I have never hung out outside of school with any of my friends, yet I see them hanging out on social media. It makes me think, \u201cmaybe I\u2019m the problem.\u201d Will I ever find a friend that truly loves me and wants to spend time with me? Finding a friend is like finding a significant other, which is even harder for LGBT people. Your chances of finding another gay boy at a small Catholic high school is 0%. On top of that, you have to see if they have similar interests or are even attractive, inside and out. Honestly, I just hope that people are right and once you get to college, you find lots of new diverse people where you can find people with similar interests and that\u2019ll truly want to hang out with you.", "title": "I feel so alone."}, {"created_utc": 1617934955, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/mn7hh2/its_been_a_long_3_months/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just finished boot camp for the U.S. Military.

It\u2019s the fact that I did\u2019t get any closure for two months and was left in the dark from December 25th until late February. I wasn\u2019t expecting it because she\u2019s a sweet and genuine person who meant a lot to me. She was the one who got me to start watching anime and stuff too. She was a weeb, but it was cute haha. She never really had any \u201ctoxic\u201c traits and we accepted each other. It was my first time with someone who was Bi. Didn\u2019t know the worst that could happen.

What\u2019s worse about that is that her girlfriend won\u2019t help by getting me to chat with her because she says she doesn\u2019t want to be involved.

Even though I have family and some really close friends I often feel lonely despise beeing alone. Its also really hard for me to open up to friends and family cause I fin it hard to express my emotions and showing love. I cringe when saying \" i love you\" to others idk why so i hardly ever do it. I hide my emotions behind jokes or try to play it down. My friends dont even know how sensitive and emotional I can be cause I just dont show it which gave me the playful title \"the cold one\" lol in our group. The only times i express my love by words is at special occasions or when I feel my friends are in need of love if that makes sense. I contastly feel sad, stressed and under pressure. I want the people around me especially my mom to be proud of me so i want to be succesful later. My mom workes really hard as a single mother so that i can have a good future later I dont want to let her down( my father left us when I was really young and we havent had contact since). I feel like she gets really proud of me when I bring good grades etc home which makes me feel really loved by her. But the constant pressure of beeing good enough and basing my worth on succes is really pressuring me which results in me beeing anxious and having panic attacks when I cant handle all the stress. Beeing anxious has led me to having panic attacks or beeing in general fearful when talking to strangers or being in a crowded in situation or in exam situations. Even though I am still really young and not suicidal at all I find the thought of dying not really frightning and more of an release. I would never commit suicide due to personal reasons and me beeing a christian (commiting is a sin due to my religion. But I wouldnt mind if I die if i could enter heaven.

I really felt bad because prior to that he messaged me saying he missed me and ask me to pay him a visit. But because there is pandemic, I told him that I cant. I remember him calling me but I wasn't able to answer because I was sleeping and I have anxiety with phone calls. By the way, he was a police officer.\n\nSo when I received the news that he tried to kill himself, I really felt guilty.  I could've known better and checked on him more often. I immediately sent a message to her sister asking what they need, organized a fundraising to help them pay the bills, sent solicitation letters and even a letter for the President of our country asking for help.\n\nDay by day, I would pray for him and his family. And I was so happy that I am seeing results. He was responding  and fighting to recover! I would always message her sister, telling her not to lose courage and keep on fighting for her older brother.\n\nHe was stable. He survived two surgeries and is awaiting for the last one, just one last surgery in the eye. We do trust doctors, don't we? He was stable and the doctors recommended to remove the machine that helped him breathe. And right there, I don't know what happened. They said his heartbeat slowed down and vomit blood. He died.\n\nI was about to sleep when I received that he's gone. I couldn't accept it. I wish I could've done better.\n\nI badly want to tell my best friends about this but I don't know how. Funny I was able to write this.\n\nBut it is true, when someone dies of suicide, yes their pain ends there. But the pain they felt would also extend to the family, friends, and to all the people they had interaction with. It will not stop. It will question one's self \"What did I miss?\" or \"I could've known because he was my son/friend.\"\n\nCheck on people regardless if you are close with them or not or if they push you away, check on them.

All three of our families where close friends, so the move, though necessary at the time, hurt us all. We ended up moving back to this city a few years later, and just a few miles away from that neighborhood, and all this time, the other two families remained living in their respective houses. Once one of my two best friends graduated high school, she moved to CA, but her parents stayed in their house. It\u2019s a big house, but run down by all the years of pets and life. \n\nMy other friend still lives with his parents in their house, and I suspect they\u2019ll all be there for a long while. About a year and a half ago we ended up signing a lease to rent the house next to his family. He and I are still friends now, but not as close as me and the other friend who moved to CA. \n\nIt\u2019s been incredibly nostalgic to live a few houses down from my childhood home, and to see my friends\u2019 parents living their lives in the houses I\u2019ve spent countless weekend hours in, playing video games, doing arts and crafts, staying up till 3 am chugging orange soda, burning popcorn, making Mac and cheese and eating peanut butter and jelly in hot dog buns, all while all our parents hung out outside grilling, playing ping pong and frisbee, etc. the the early hours of the next morning. We caught lizards and praying mantises, moths, ladybugs and grasshoppers. We crashed and burned on our bikes, we swam, we explored the neighborhood. We grieved together when our pets died. We helped each other on our homework. We fought, we made up, we grew up. \n\nIn a few months\u2019 time, the parents in that big house are moving away. They deserve to go to a new city in a state they love more than here. In a nicer house that isn\u2019t made of broken bones, where they can relax. Not stuck.\n\nBut fuck. I\u2019m so sad. There are so many memories in that house, both good and bad, of course. I know this grieving is natural and normal, but I didn\u2019t expect it to hit me. I thought I\u2019d be fine. \n\nMy own parents are over there now, helping them sift through decades of stuff. I asked if they wanted more help, but I don\u2019t even think I\u2019d be able to keep it together. I\u2019m going to eventually look to that house and see someone\u2019s car that I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m hope whoever comes along next will create as many memories as we all did in that house, in that cul de sac. And then, at the end of this year, we will likely be moving ourselves. Just across town, but we won\u2019t have a reason to come back to this neighborhood, really ever again. That\u2019s a very strange though. The fear of the unfamiliar resonates in the back of my mind.\n\nI keep thinking about how hurt I felt when my parents told us we were moving across the country and bringing up that trauma. I thought it was a joke. I thought it couldn\u2019t be happening. My friends and I were in disbelief. How would we get through this? I was only about to be in 6th grade, how would I find new friends? To be honest, I never really did. And the three of us faded out of each other\u2019s lives. Not completely, as I talk to them here and there. But it\u2019s not how it was. And will never be how it once was. \n\nI was in their backyard one day after I found out we were moving and I found a small piece of a broken plate. I kept it, and still have it to this day. I would hold it and cry when I missed my friends. Looking back, I find it ironically funny that I held on to this piece of glass. It was probably broken out of frustration or anger, but back then I saw it as a puzzle piece connecting me back to them, no matter where I was or where they were. I still see it that way, but with a little less na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\nBut that\u2019s life, right?\n\nThis feeling fucking sucks.", "title": "Moving sucks.

So for 9 years my family attended the charity walk. We're not particularly good fundraisers, most of the money comes from the team itself, but hopefully the small amount helps. I tend to feel like a prop, but I try not to dwell on it. \n\nThen in my family's 10th year, Covid. The walk became virtual, which is understandable. We all still walked in various locations. Some went to parks or hiking. I moved away just before covid, so my SO and I got to spend the Walk at the ocean.\n\nThe walk is still virtual this year. Months ago I found the event info with the date, shared it, and said since we're all vaccinated we could meet in the middle and do the walk somewhere fun. That was The Plan.\n\nA couple weeks ago, my mom tried to change the plan. Worth noting, I've recently been diagnosed with Autism which explain why I'm not good with changing plans(partially why the original plan was vague, gives my brain wiggle room). Mom wanted to combine the walk with my grandma's birthday at grandma's house. \n\nGrandma's house in not in the middle, I'm the farthest away. I'm not driving 2 hours, to walk for an hour in a location that is not particularly enjoyable or safe, then driving 2 hours home. Plus we've never really had a birthday party for grandma before, weird time to start. We do combine birthdays/holidays a lot but never the walk, it's exhausting. \n\nSo at the last second, mom says we can do the birthday on Sunday. No team page has been made, no donations. There's no plans to walk, together or otherwise. Today's planning discussions have all been about the food on Sunday. I don't plan on going on sunday because I'll probably be a bitter bitch and I know to avoid situations that make it worse.\n\nWhen my sisters talk about the walk, they say they're walking for their youngest sister. To me, the walk has never been about me. I'm so tired of seeing obituaries. It feels like they're okay with disappointing me and ignoring the suffering of others.\n\nI've be walking the 5k tomorrow with my SO. We'll probably go to the ocean again. Since we don't have a team page, I guess we'll figure out how to donate to the event itself.", "title": "I feel Forgotten"}, {"created_utc": 1624684078, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/o84btl/i_wish_i_can_also_play_games_and_stream/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "I really want to play games since i was a kid and stream since highschool.

On my birthday I was stirring on my bed and he came to my room in the morning and he said happy birthday once. I had hardly opened my eyes and went back to sleep(couldn't even reply) .

My dad can barely walk, talk, breathe and do daily activities. \n\nMy parents refuse to go to the hospital or hospice or have other people/social workers take care of my dad. So instead my mom has been taking care of him. I'm an only child and I don't live with my parents but my husband and i try to visit once a week. My parents are not very good with English and they also have a very weak mentality. Since my mom is taking care of my dad - she said the least I can do is to prepare all the paperwork for funeral/cemetery prearangements which I agree with. I think it's only fair and it's the least I can do. However My mom does not want me to ask anything to my dad on what he wants to happen with his body. My dad also don't know that he has less than a few months left. My mom refuses to tell any detail to my dad as she thinks he would worry more and be stressed and get worse. \n\nI've been suffering from depression for over 4 years now. I also have a lot of financial problems. I also have 2 cats that I absolutely love but am allergic to. I have medications for my cat allergies and depression. But because of my financial problems I can't afford medication anymore and it's been about 3 weeks now since I haven't had any medication. I also don't have a therapist because again I can't afford it. (Where I live, they offer free counselling but it takes forever to get in and the counsellors are known to be terrible based on 1 star Google reviews from hundreds of people). My work also closed for 2 weeks so my paycheck was very little. Plus I really needed a mental week off as I have been too sad and depressed and cry too much that I can't function regularly anymore. So my paycheck will be very little again. My phone bill is too high and soon I'm going to get cut off from my phone as well. \n\nThe only thing that's keeping me together is my very loving husband. He supports me all the time but with the way I am, Im just too depressed with life because of my parents, my finances and my work (they have been giving me a hard time when I request days off for mental or doctor stuff). I also have a very low self esteem and high anxiety and am very very sensitive. \nI've had suicidal thoughts before but after I got married to my husband I haven't been thinking of that anymore. \n\nAnyway today my dad woke up paralyzed for a few seconds and crying asking for me. And basically his dying wish is to go to the casino.... my dad is too addicted. He has spent so much and loaned so much money to gamble before he became ill. He has 2 life insurances and after he passes, the money we get from them is not even enough to cover all his debt. But of course he wants to go to the casino so bad and preferrably asap because he doesn't know how much time he has left. \n\nMy birthday is on Wednesday, 3 days from now and that's the soonest availability for me and my husband. I can't say no to my dad as I feel too bad for him so of course I said we will do it on my bday. \nMy husband already planned a few things for my bday but I'm canceling them all to escort my dad wherever he wants to go and watch him so my mom can shower and do groceries etc... \nMy dad initially said no he doesn't want to do it on my bday but I can tell how much and how soon he wants to go so I insisted we do it on Wednesday. My mom texted me after I spoke to my dad that he is very happy and excited on Wednesday. \n\nI guess I feel sad: \n-because my dad's dying wish is to go to the casino\n-because it has to be on my bday (even tho I offered it to be on my bday) \n-because I'm dealing with so much things in life plus lots of paperwork and prearrangements for my dad but I'm restricted to ask what he wants so I have to make all the decision\n-because my parents refuse any help from other people even tho it's free (social workers/hospice etc)\n-because I plan a lot of things and surprises for birthdays for my husband and some friends. I plan everything from scheduling every minute down to what kind of candle to put on their cake and deep down I feel that i don't deserve my birthday to end up being an escort to my dad \n-im sad because I was looking forward to my bday as my husband planned a couple of things  and now I'm canceling that \n-I can't celebrate my bday on the day of and I can't do it the weekend of my bday because it's my husband's brother's bday and I don't like sharing bdays with other people especially if it doesn't doesn't fall on my exact bday\n\nI'm sad because I guess I was expecting. I just wanted to spend time on my bday playing board games. I don't ask for too much. But of course i feel bad for my dad - I can have another bday next year but he can't.

I live with my parents along with my older sister and younger brother (I'm middle). I'm in college and started a new job and it's frustrating that I can be gone all day doing school stuff or work, then me home to a dirty kitchen when one or both of my siblings have been home for hours. And guess who my parents get mad at? Oh of course it's me \nNot only do I clean everyday but i help my parent get my brother to all of his practices and events he needs to be at. I also try very hard to finish as much work as possible so I can hang out with my family at least a little. \nThough it really hurts when they call me lazy or get mad at me for things that aren't my fault. I feel so frustrated and like a disappointment when these things happen especially cause I don't have the confidence to fight back. All I can do is apologize or stay quiet as they badmouth me or lecture me.\nI try to do so much to please them even hanging out with them more them my other siblings but I still feel as though I get less affection as the others. And I guess that's natural when I'm the middle child, and the second daughter. I have far less importance then the first daughter and the only boy. I often feel like things I'm excited about are kinda just brushed off as just \"cool\" but when my siblings have something they find exciting parents are actually interested.\nWhen we all go out together as a family I often don't get to have much time to talk because my siblings get the attention (just started carrying around a book).\nAnother thing that annoys me is how often I get in trouble for trying to get my brother to stop pretty much bullying. (I've had a few breakdowns because of this though I only broke down when I was alone). It's frustrating that my brother can hit me, poke me, kick me, take my stuff, barge in while I'm doing homework and be loud, and just bother me. But me telling him to stop means I'm sensitive or being a bitch and that I should calm down cause he's a boy and that's how they act. Even though I had tried to ask him to stop multiple times before. \nMy siblings are also very lazy and will not help me clean, put food away, put clothes away, do the yard, vacuum etc. unless my parents tell them to do so.\nI'm just so tired of doing all the cleaning with no help and if something isn't cleaned right or I didn't clean a day then I'd be called lazy. How me asking my brother to stop disrespecting me is my fault and how I'm ruining the mood. I'm annoyed that when my siblings don't do the work they were supposed to do it just gets pushed onto me without them getting any consequence. How I can spend hours working on schoolwork just to be called lazy for not coming out of my room. How I can be mentally and physically exhausted from school stuff and want to drive with the music lower but then that makes me a selfish bitch. How me forgetting something means I'm stupid and unreliable. How being insulted can make me upset or angry, but apparently I'm just being \"sensitive\".\nHow not going to the gum means I'm fat (I don't think I'm fat I have a lil pouch but most people wouldn't look at me and think I'm fat...at least that's what I'd like to believe). \nI do love my family a lot and I  lucky to have them but sometimes they are just really toxic and it really hurts me. Knowing myself I will probably delete this in the morning. I just needed to rant a lil and I don't want to bother anyone with a random rant unless they really care to actually read.

He called some other people and they accompanied me to the place where I can sit down.\n\nWe had a long conversation about friendships, my life and why I was hating myself so much that I wanted to pass out. Eventually, I've crossed the line and talked out everything I feel even now. I feel alone, empty, and also I had thoughts that all of my friends and close people are fake and they do not exist in my soul. The situation was bad and as they felt offended, I walked away to be alone and to collect my thoughts together.\n\nThey found me later and sat down to check on me to make sure I will not serf harm or attempt to suicide. As I remember, they seemed shocked and lost. One of them were my old friend. She and I were (and hopefully still will be) friends for nearly 14 years.\n\nI need your help. I don't know what to do now and only thing I think right now, is to apologize for everything I've said that evening.. I will listen to all your opinions and hopefully update my post on my situation.

And trust me I did it as nicely as I possibly could, even leaving the door open to try in the future. I just wasn\u2019t attracted to this girl physically or emotionally at that point.

I\u2019ve been really sad and depressed this week I just feel like the world is against me. First, I\u2019ve been trying to move out of my toxic mothers house for the past few months but it\u2019s been really hard apartment hunting. It\u2019s just me and my best friend and we\u2019re both young and work server jobs so we can\u2019t afford anything too expensive. Anyways we both decided to put the rental hunting on pause for a bit so we can save extra money to be really secure. Then, recently this week my life has just been in shambles. \n\nFirst, I got pulled over a few days ago and side note I live in Pennsylvania (specifically Philly). So the cop comes up to my window and tells me I got pulled over because my tints are too dark. Fair enough it\u2019s true my tints are 5% but cops in Philly literally do not care and I\u2019ve had these tints for like two years and never been pulled over but whatever. I was driving in the suburbs and it was like 2am so I feel like he was just bored. Then, he asks for my id and registration turns out both expired two months ago and I didn\u2019t even know. I just felt like things kept getting worse haha. I couldn\u2019t complain because it was my fault. So anyway he takes my documents and comes back after a while. When he comes up to my window he says \u201cI can smell weed in your car so just be honest and tell me how much you have\u201d. In the moment I was scared and I didn\u2019t know that smell is not a probable cause so I was honest and told him I had 3 grams. He made me step out of my car and told me to sign a paper to give them consent to search my car. The cops search my car and take literally all my weed shit (rolling papers, rolling tray, pipe, et) I had everything in a small backpack and I was kinda upset in the moment ngl.  So whatever now I\u2019m gonna get fined and have all these tickets to pay off. \n\nTo top everything off! Two days ago , I had about 900$ in cash inside of a small safe that I was going to deposit at the bank.  Long story short I ended up losing my money in the street. I drove back to the area and literally searched everywhere. Somebody had snatched the safe I knew it. I ended up breaking down in my car and I just cried and cried for about an hour. I feel like bad shit just keeps happening to me. In moments like these I just think what\u2019s the point of life? Why am I here? Im just not happy. Like why do these things keep happening to me. \n\nAnyways, I just wanted to come on here and rant about everything and hopefully some of you guys have similar stories that\u2019ll make me feel better haha.", "title": "Bad shit keeps happening to me"}, {"created_utc": 1644788887, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/srty1d/whats_love_like/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "What\u2019s love like?"}, {"created_utc": 1644787715, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/srti4n/im_going_to_leave_this_here/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I'm going to leave this here"}, {"created_utc": 1644787562, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/srtg57/idk_whats_going_on_inside_of_my_head/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "i\u2019m so fucking confused man.", "title": "idk what\u2019s going on inside of my head"}, {"created_utc": 1644786348, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/srszgi/morning_go_to_kitchen_for_coffee_sit_at_table/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "As title says... husband gets annoyed easily and basically he retreated to the bedroom with his coffee (even though before I came he was happy to be in the kitchen sitting, I come in &amp; we say a bit, not much, haven't been fighting &amp; he leaves and I know it is because he is annoyed by me. \nI'm just crushed", "title": "Morning: go to kitchen for coffee &amp; sit at table, husband leaves pretty sure he is just annoyed at my presence...so hurt..."}, {"created_utc": 1644784503, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/srs9o1/why_r_my_friends_like_this/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "anytime i talk or tell my friends something they always give each-other a weird ass look that basically says \u201cwtf is this bitch saying lmfao can she stfu\u201d \nthey always leave me out especially at school. \nthey always make me feel bad. for example one time i said something and nobody answered and my bsf just felt the need to say \u201clmao noticed how nobody answered\u201d. \nthey always do stuff like that and joke about my mental health and make suicide jokes about me.", "title": "why r my friends like this"}, {"created_utc": 1644784193, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/srs5e0/ion_wanna_die/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "i just want to sleep forever. imagine just sleeping in a nice comfortable bed all the time. still being able to have ur parents see you, and talk to you. you would still be in ur own house, safe.", "title": "ion wanna die"}, {"created_utc": 1644782900, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/srrnpb/i_cant_feel_after_years_of_bottling_up/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "Sometimes I feel that I am a monotonous robot and have no feelings. I will not stretch it out to any accidental trauma but I think years of being alone can be the cause.\n\nI have quite a bit of problems with my elder sister, dad and my mom. My mom is a person who is constantly badgering me to look more like a girl(forcing to wear eyeliner and lipstick) ,a sister who is extremely bratty,entitled,narcissictic, kleptomaniac and a father so indifferent to my feelings.\n\nMy sister had a share of her drama .First being the one who is flunking maths and sciences while I scored stellar marks . The competition may have affected her ,but in no way my parents compare us. We are way too different and I'm also 5 years younger. There was a time where she had to sit for college entrances at 19 and had to come to me for maths(me being 14 back then) for help to teach her maths. Her 75% was celebrated while my 90% was not. \n\nThen her and my mom have a volatile relation too. In my culture there is share of physical punishment and my sister has a lot of it(I have too but not to that extent).Ngl my mom is crack but sister is the kind of person to get on her nerves. She also has a history of stealing few thousand dollars from her dad to buy a phone since her previous has been snatched away due to her flunking classes. (And blaming me for it, that's story for another time).\nEvery bit of her problems are told that of moms fault. My dad being the most vocal about it. She has been to plenty of therapy dad put her in. They are the closest. Like she has the tiniest issue and will call dad at 4am not bothering that he's dead tired from work. \n\nComing to me,I have a genetic speech disorder which went worse with anxiety caused my fights at home(the marriages a trainwreck). There was this huge part of my life being bullied and me effectively being the loner. In the last few years,I have regained my place in school for being the loudthinker and bold.I started being outspoken and confrontational to face my fears. People are good to me in school but I'm loner mostly because we don\u2019t have the same vibe. The thing that bothers me is that my dad never thought that I would need therapy too. Especially after being molested by my swimming teacher when I was 5-6. He did report him to the club authorities but neither parent thought of to talk to me,let alone therapy.They mostly assume that just because I don\u2019t cry out loud,I don\u2019t have trauma. They know I have a tendency of bottling up but never really cared to prod and ask. My sister is a big crier even at 23 and my father has always babied her.\n\nThe pandemic she has been home for months and its killing me. She constantly steals from me,uses my toothbrush(disgusting asf) ,talks loudly and plays speakers all day while I'm on the verge of giving the most prestigious exams a student gives at the end if highschool.Whenever I tell my dad,he says he's too tired and she doesn\u2019t listens to him and eventually stopped talking to me so as to avoid listening to any problems I may have. \n\nHe's genuinely a great dad. And I know parents can and do have favs but does he always has to make this so evident. Everytime he comes home,she doesn\u2019t bother to open the door or give him something to eat. ITS ALWAYS ME. Yet,I'm always the one he cares less about.\n\nI don\u2019t have a boyfriend or a crush (fyi last one was 6 yrs back). I have just one close friend for the last 12 years. My sister gets mad when I plan my firsts around my bff (like first smoke,beer , trying outnew restaurants and historical places) and calls me lesbian. Honestly,I would love to be one .\nI'm just genuinely tired. I'm yet to be 18. In my country students mostly do their degree in their own states. I'm trying to leave but the competition is extremely high outstation.\n\n I'm done. And lastly, I don\u2019t feel things.

She used to act really inappropriately towards him even when I was literally there (to the extent that her own friends came up to me pointing out that they had noticed). I also know at least once that she and him exchanged super inappropriate messages which were flirty and overtly sexual while him and I were together. He told me that talking to her now is nothing to worry about but given what I know on good authority I have reason to doubt. I've never really fully articulated how I feel about this girl because I didn't want to be controlling but having shards of doubt that he could be moving directionally to her just absolutely stabs me in the gut and makes me feel even more stupid for being so reticent to move on.

A week ago I suggested the Idea that I drive up to her college to celebrate her birthday party in a few weeks with her but she became aggressive at the idea and said she wanted to celebrate with her college friends. It constantly feels like she is only hanging out with me as a compromise because her college friends are not around, like she just migjt as well because there is no one better. There is not anyone I would rather talk to, or hang out with and every time Im around her now she is in a mood and all she talks about is how much she wants to be around her college friends or last semester's college buddy drama. I completely understand that she enjoys the college life more but she is my absolute best friend and I just feel like I don't mean that much to her. Like she is only around me now because Im the next best choice because Im not around her college buddies. I have suggested going up there but there she consistently shot it down so I have stopped asking. I just know I am about to me more alone than I have ever been in my life and Im fucking scared.\n\nSorry for wall of text and poor grammar Im just upset and had to get it out.

We where just talking one day and brings up a friend his name is Nate.. I told Nate that week that I didn\u2019t want to be friends Because he was a complete creep. Well he told everyone in our friend group that we \u201cbroke up\u201d when we didn\u2019t even date.. and well my boyfriend got mad and yelled at me for hours and hours. Not letting me explain to him what was actually going on, so I just gave up... he didn\u2019t talk to me for a few days.. until he told me that he was sorry for yelling at me and stuff. So I forgave him and happily ever after right? Well no.. not exactly.. a week later he told me that he wants to be female and that he\u2019s already been talking the pills, so of course I\u2019m happy for him. A few days later I get a threat in my DMs.. some girl saying she\u2019s going to kill me if I don\u2019t treat him right, so of course I tell him about it and he says just to leave it alone, so I do. But then they keep coming more and more from different account, and so I couldn\u2019t take it so I tell him about it and tell him to make them stop.. but of course he says \u201cyour overreacting, just ignore them..\u201d so I listen to him... so then he changed his name to nina and I thought it was adorable  so I called her Nina (I\u2019m pansexual btw)  and that\u2019s when nina would get into trouble and me being the good girlfriend I was I helped her. I always fought for her. But she never fought for me.. always told me that I was a big girl and can do it myself..  but then she would neglect me.. never answer my texts for days.. tell me to shut up or yell at me for doing something wrong.. and when we would get into arguments she always threaded to hit me and tell our friends about the \u201cthings\u201d I did, she always just yelled and yelled at me, telling me everything is my fault and that I am such a disappointment.. \nI got with Nina after my two year relationship with some guy named dan and she always  made me feel bad about it. Saying that I\u2019m the response he cheated because I\u2019m to annoying and to clingy. But it was just a normal for us, laughing and talk about stuff.. when she just randomly brings up a tweet of my it said \u201chow did he find out about my smut collection \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\u201d  and she turns red when she told about it.  Nina knew he was only a friend and that we never dated in the past, and it was just a joke it wasn\u2019t serious. But then I remembered the texts msgs my bff Kiki sent me, Nina was saying things like \u201csuck my dick bitch you like that stuff huh\u201d  and when I showed her the screenshots she got even more made saying that I was lying and making things up like I always am. At this point I\u2019m already on the floor crying and telling her how I was feeling, and...when I least expected it.. *smack* ...she slapped me.. so now I\u2019m trying not to cry even harder she grabs me by my chin and said.. \u201calways remember who you belong to and who you have to obey, because if I find you out fo line again I won\u2019t hesitate to hit you\u201d ever since then I always listen to her always  did what she said  even when I didn\u2019t want to.. she even got me trying to keep the relationship together when she tried ending it... I needed her so bad..\nShe was only hurting me making me cry every day making me paranoid to sleep to even go on social media for a few months.. but that\u2019s when I found out.. she had sex with her best friend when we were together..  want to know what I did?  I told her about it only for her to yell like always being called a  \u201cliar\u201d  and a bunch of other stuff..\nShe always told me \u201cI love you\u201d and I always believed it because I was so blind and scared of losing her I didn\u2019t realize how bad I was being treated.. and that\u2019s when we broke up she yelled at me for wanting to leave. And called me a slut a whore and ya know.. well I left only to realize how messed up and broken I am.. I now have bad case of paranoia I always flinch when I see someone move towards me and  I constantly have trust issues.. my depression has gotten worse since then, she\u2019s brain washed me into believing all this stuff that\u2019s not true about me.  \n\nI know it was like five months ago since it happened but it still haunts me.

I'm currently seventeen years of age, and I wanted to take the time to tell you (dear reader) about my life, more specifically, what unfolded during my earlier years of living. I'm terrible at writing, however, I write down my feelings each day because my therapist recommends it. \n\nI grew up in England and the street I grew up on was nothing out of the ordinary. I lived in a house with my brother, father and mother. My father was an alcoholic and from the first day I can ever remember, he was always chain-smoking tobacco or drinking copius amounts of beer in the lounge, my father would always seem miserable and so would my mother. During my spare time, I would play the xbox in my room, which had many games pre-installed onto it, I never knew how exactly, though I know that those games were probably installed illegally. I played all of the classics during my time at home, including metal gear solid, burnout and tomb raider; I grew up alongside this machine not knowing that it'd be my best friend for the next decade. I had no friends at school, and would frequently be shouted at, or told off for not doing my work; the teachers concluded that I was a trouble-maker from a very young age, the children in my class all knew me based upon that very idea. During class, I would always be escorted to a seperate room, with children who seemed developmentally slow; the teachers there would read us stories to teach us basic mathematics and english, trying to make the experience of learning more enjoyable and appealing to us all. At the time, I believed that these sessions were nothing out of the ordinary, and found it to be pretty cool. Turns out, I was autistic (diagnosed at 14).\n\nMy father would always watch football or quiz shows on the television when I got home, the smell of tobacco and beer could be noticed as soon as my mother and I came in through the door after school. Realising it now, my father never greeted me or acknowledged my presence when I got home. I would head straight to my room when getting home from school to play xbox, mindlessly wasting away, playing the same few games for years and years on my own, while my father would get drunk and yell at the television, supposedly to support his favourite football team. I grew up not liking sports because of this. My father would drink to the point where he couldn't stand, and would shout for me, my brother or my mother to help him during the late hours of the night, we were all awake but pretended we were just asleep, we were scared to death of him. \n\nWhen my father was sober, he would travel several towns over to work for a few days at a time, returning on weekends or the days throughout the week, I suppose his work schedule was flexible. These times were my respite, I didn't have to worry about being scared of him. I believed my father was a monster, he would have epileptic fits and bite his tongue, bleeding all over the carpet in the process, spilling his beer all over the floor and as he would start moaning or screaming, my older brother and mother were forced to help him as I would cower in the corner of the room, crying and screaming out \"daddy's turning into a monster\", my brother made fun of me for saying things like that, all the way up until I was 11 (this happened when I was 5). \n\nAt night, I would get hungry, and would sometimes come downstairs to the lounge where I ate leftovers such as pepperoni pizza. I would sit in the lounge room with my father, where he would comment on the looks of women on the television, cigarette in hand, empty beer cans always littered the floor or tables surrounding him. During these late night talks with my father, he would sometimes give me back rubs, I would take off my shirt and listen to him speak to me about sex while he did this, I never knew it was wrong. As soon as he spoke about sex, I couldn't leave the room, I started to develop sexual urges early on in life and started to masturbate at the age of 6 as a result of this. He did disgusting things to me, things that I cannot even write, things I will never even say aloud to myself in an empty room, things I'll never ever write in a fucking diary or journal, things I'd never even wish upon anyone in this world. My father would beat my mother with blunt objects frequently, my older brother and I would have to stop them.  My brother is equally as despicable as my father was, though he may use reddit, and I don't want to take the chance of him seeing this if I talk about him here. \n\nMy father's abuse went on for over 5 years, this occured regularly throughout that time. At a young age (5-7) I remember being alone in class with a female teacher of mine during play time, she was tying my shoelace because I hadn't learned how to do them at that point, and after she had finished, I pulled down my trousers and expected her to do what my father had done to me at home during the night, she gave me a questioning and terrified look as I stood there confused. I don't remember what happened after that. \n\nMy father's drunken behaviour escelated, I recall one time we got into a car crash due to him being drunk and having an epileptic fit, he lost his driver's license after that. I was driven home in a police van, unscathed, but terrified. \n\nMy father's abuse stopped once he was diagnosed with a brain hemorrhage, my father had brain surgery multiple times before this for reasons I haven't been told, though from what I understand, if my father didn't accept treatment, he would die. In my bed at night, I kept thinking of him the night before his surgery, and was scared that he would die. I went downstairs one last time to speak with him, where the usual nightly routine took place. As he left our house the next morning, and I watched him go through the kitchen window, I knew that my life wouldn't be the same. During my father's surgery, the surgeons ran into many complications, this left my father in a state where he was fully dependent on everyone else, having the mind of a toddler, barely even capable of forming a sentence, incapable of swallowing hard foods. When me and my family visited him, we had to introduce ourselves to him as if we first met, I drew him a card with rainbows and colourful flowers, with the words \"I love you dad\" in orange. We all left through the hospital doors that day, hopeful that he would recover. \n\nMy father continued to show signs of improvement, but would then fall ill once more, again and again. My father was transferred to many different hospitals during his time in recovery, typically I and my family would travel 30 miles each weekend to see him; we grew to resent him. My brother was abusive, I don't want to talk about it, but whenever I showed interest in something, every time I was proud of something, every time I did something questionable, every time I failed at something, he would make me doubt myself; he would threaten me with violence on a regular basis just so I could make him a cup of tea, just so I could let him play games, just for refusing his demands. This occured during the time my father had abused me previously, it only grew worse in my later years alongside him, I always envied him for his looks, intelligence and popularity, he was always the favourite. \n\nDuring the 2 hour train rides to my father, my brother would kick my legs until they were bruised, bleeding and swollen. He would relentlessly torment me, my mother would say \"it's just a joke\". After a while my father showed significant improvement, and was moved to a group home. This group home was in the countryside, it had horses, pigs, goats and sheep which the patients would pet and take care of. It was so quiet and peaceful. Each time I saw that place I felt so sorry for my dad. \n\nEach time we visited my father, he would show me love and attempt to stand from his wheelchair, he would wink at me, slap my knees, attempt to make jokes with me and he even taught me how to play pool. When my dad was away from home, I realised what happened to me wasn't normal, I did a lot of thinking and was just trying to surpress my memories of him. I grew to love him, but I also couldn't let go of my feelings of hatred and sadness, heartbreak. After a particularly brutal case of bullying from my brother, I was left crying on the floor in the corner of the room, the room me and my father played pool in. My dad and mother were sitting near the table at the opposite side of the room, my dad on his wheelchair. He noticed me crying, curled up in the fetal position, I cried so hard, I was almost screaming, hands covering my face. My father interupted my mother in the middle of her sentence with a brief, but assertive mumble, she grew silent, and my crying stopped. I listened to the noise around me, and realised that my father had stood up from his wheelchair, using every single bit of energy he could muster to rush to my aid. He bent down on one knee and carefully placed his hand on my shoulder, and attempted to hug me. I wanted to love him back, but I hated him so much, I continued to gently push my father away as he continuously attempted to hug me, this continued for 5 minutes, I was shown an unconditional love by my father which I had never felt before in my life, as I continued to push him back gently, I started to cry even harder with each push; until eventually my father hugged me with a determined force, I could do nothing but stand there with my arms to my side.\n\nA month later, he was no longer conscious and was dying, he was anorexic and was making gargling noises in his sleep, those noises are something I will always remember. Before saying goodbye to him forever, I held his hand without saying a word for some time, before getting up and leaving. I knew he was dead. A few days later he passed on and I didn't know what to think, after my mother had told me the news, I retreated into my room, where I stared at my reflection for an extended period of time. When my mother and brother left to go shopping, the door slammed behind them and I just bursted into tears, feeling a genuine sadness, I then proceeded to laugh uncontrollably, whilst also missing him and grieving simultaneously. \n\nBefore the funeral we were escorted to a room, where his body was. I still remember the smell, I stood in the doorway staring at his body, whilst my brother mocked me from outside, laughing at my reaction, he wasn't even brave enough to look in through that door, and would belittle me for shedding a single tear at his funeral. My dad didn't look like him, his face was sunken in, his skin was pale, he was skinny. \n\nMe and brother haven't talked in 3 years, I slit my wrists and I was hospitalised for 2 years, became addicted to drugs for a year and a half,  and started drinking and smoking cigarettes. I managed to give that all up in hopes of a better life. My best friend, and another have taken their lives, and some relatives of mine have passed on from other causes. I missed 2 and a half years of school and re-enrolled at 16.\n\nAfter being enrolled back into school, my grades were excellent, the only things I was addicted to were caffeine and nicotine. I study computer science now, and if my grades stay the way they do, I could be heading to the best universities this country has to offer. I'm currently trying to quit smoking, and I try to make friends, but it all seems so scary to me, I'm scared of my future, my family is broken apart. I feel as if this is my fault, my mother looks at me like I'm a monster, I wish I had a family, I really do. \n\nYours faithfully, Cockycowboy", "title": "I'm frightened to death of stability, I can't move on from my past trauma."}, {"created_utc": 1581040203, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/f037l6/something_really_bad_happened_today/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a small pp", "title": "Something really bad happened today..."}, {"created_utc": 1581039953, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/f035nw/you_ever_just/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "you ever just..."}, {"created_utc": 1581038722, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/f02vvg/youtuber_talks_about_the_struggles_of_losing_his/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "YouTuber talks about the struggles of losing his SON"}, {"created_utc": 1581038135, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/f02r5l/planning_on_killing_myself_today_just_couldnt/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Planning on killing myself today.

Of course there's plenty of people showing off their bong rips, house parties, pets, etc. But one day I had come across this kid who stuck out.   He looked to be old enough to be in middle school, crooked teeth, ratty hair, always smiling. He seemed to live in a pretty empty home as if he was just moving in, but his posts would sometimes show a crock pot on the living room floor, or a sofa across the room from a TV laying flat on the ground, yet still plugged in. Odd living conditions.\n\nThe first snap I saw was just of him in his backyard with a single tree and some WAY overgrown weeds. He had some beer cans set up in a pyramid, and tossed a ball towards it for his dog to fetch. The dog obviously crashed into them and then everything disappeared into the weeds. He turns the camera around to himself in a gasp, and the video ends. It was just odd, out of place for the rest of my town.\nI'd stumble across a few more of his posts as I did my local snap surfing, sometimes it was a video of his xbox in his room, or a bottle flip, typical kid stuff. Eventually I decided to keep up with him, to the point that I'd check twice a day in his area to see if he had posted.\nOne day he posted a video of his room, now just a mattress, a door, and a broken bookshelf, with the caption \"miss my xbox\".\nObviously this kid was living in a tough spot, I felt bad for him. But he managed to make the best of his life it seemed. He'd post videos of him up in his tree, more of his dog, or maybe just a picture of him with a soda bottle.   \nIt was nostalgic in a way. I grew up decently well off, but I went to middle school school near a lower-income area. As a result, most of my friends were living lower-income lives. We'd take walks to the dollar store and get sodas, play basketball in the park, and of course then I'd go home to my 6-bedroom 2-story house with an HOA... I digress. There was something about watching a kid live a life similar to my friends' that was just so bittersweet.  \nOver time though, his problems became more obvious. Pictures of his beat down family car with tires stolen, shots of his kitchen covered in empty marlboro packs, at one point even saying goodbye to his family dog because they couldn't afford him anymore.\nHe had a roof over his head and a place to sleep. I pray he had food as well.   \nOne day he posts a video of him shooting bb pellets through a picture of a girl. It seemed like a professional photo, like she was part of the family. Perhaps a cousin or a sister. A day later he posts another of his empty home in the afternoon, no lights on. A caption explaining that his electricity bill again went unpaid.\nSeeing his life spiral into such bare bones made me think back to my middle school days and hope none of my friends ever had to go through something like this.\n\nThe last snaps I ever saw from him were some short videos of himself explaining that his sister had met some crazy boyfriend, and the cops were now on their way to his home.   \n\"She chose this GUY over me and my mom and dad.\"\n\"I'm scared, I don't know what to do, nobody's here. The cops are just gonna come in and find me sittin' on the couch.\"   \n\"There ain't nothin' left for them to take we don't even got no lights no more.\"   \n\"took my dog, took my bed, took my xbox, what's next?

We weren't legally married, but still called each other husband and wife. Partly because we had been together for so long and partly because we had been married in the past. We met about 10 years ago and things were great, but she fell into drugs and alcohol and it more or less ruined things. I have three kids from a previous marriage (two are biological, one is not) and I couldn't have them exposed to the type of things she was involved in. My previous marriage did not end well (hint, hint - one child that is not biologically related to me) and my ex was always looking for a way to keep the kids from me. So the wife moved out until she got cleaned up, but she met another guy that supported her habits and convinced her to divorce me. Over the next couple of years, she would clean up and we would get together, but she would always fall back into the same old bad habits and we would split up. I should have cut off all contact after the divorce, but I loved her so damn much...\n\nSo about three years ago she gets pregnant and the guy disappears and doesn't want anything to do with either of them. Her and I start talking again and I realize that her having a child was the wake up call she needed to get clean. When the only well-being that mattered was hers, she didn't care what happened, but now that someone was dependent on her, she completely changed. She turned back into the women I originally met and I was so happy. I asked her to move in with me and we started raising our daughter together.\n\nUnfortunately, no matter what I did, I could not get her to let me adopt our daughter. It isn't that didn't want it to happen, but she received benefits from the state and those would go away if I became her legal father. I explained numerous times that the benefits didn't matter, but she wouldn't budge. Because of her past, she had trouble with work and didn't make much money and I think the state benefits were the only way she thought she was contributing to the family. This was ridiculous, of course, but I couldn't convince her.\n\nSo in October of 2019 we move into a house owned by her father/grandmother. The house was nice and the rent was cheap so we could start saving and buy our own house some day. Little did I know that she had relapsed over the summer. She hid it extremely well, but in hindsight it explains why she never seemed to have any money, or be able to contribute. I found out when she was arrested for stealing from an employer. She was so worried I was going to leave, but I told her we were a team and we would get through it. She entered into some programs through the court system and we continued on our way. Unfortunately, she received some bad advice about a way to self medicate and treat an opiate addiction. Without my knowledge she started drinking large amounts of Immodium. The quantities lead to a cardiac arrest and she passed away in December of last year. This was two months after our daughter turned three.\n\nHer parents offered to temporarily watch our daughter while I grieved and adjusted which seemed fine to me. Two weeks ago, however, I found out they intended to permanently keep my daughter and only allow visitation. I wasn't even allowed to take her back to my house because they claimed it was too traumatic for her. I told them I would fight them over it. That was my daughter and we would let a court decide where she was supposed to be. I started figuring out a plan to pay for a lawyer, but yesterday I received an eviction notice... So now I have to afford an new place to stay on top of trying to find a lawyer and there is only so much money to go around.\n\nI went from extremely happy with where my life was headed to having no wife, a daughter I can't see, and potentially no home in the next 30 days.

I feel so much better to have her out of my life. Or at least I thought I did until everyone in my family sided with my sister and told me I was being unreasonable. It seems everyone has a soft spot for her (she\u2019s ten years older than me) just because she used to suffer from severe depression. She is a lot better now and is starting to get her life together again after 7+ years. What my family don\u2019t know is that I have also been dealing with depression and anxiety but I\u2019m less open about it. I keep my thoughts and feelings to myself and I have been this way ever since I could remember. I was suicidal and seriously thought of taking action. \n\nIt got so bad to the point I didn\u2019t care anymore and the depression that I\u2019ve been holding inside was shining through my daily life and even then nobody seemed to want to acknowledge I was not okay. Even my sister, who I know noticed, did nothing. \n\nWhen my mum asked me what was the matter and what caused me to make such a huge decision to cut my sister out my life I decided to open up to her. I thought I could trust her. I thought she would understand. I cried in front of her which I never do. I used hate crying in front of people. She\u2019s simple minded. She just wants her children to get along and I completely understand that but I can\u2019t bring myself to act like nothing\u2019s wrong with me and my sister. I have so much built up shame, guilt and hurt towards my sister that simply talking to her now makes my chest so heavy and tight and brings tears to my eyes. I can\u2019t do it. It feels wrong, wrong to speak to someone who has hurt me so many times. \n\nNow my other sister (who said she wouldn\u2019t take sides) has taken her side. They do everything together. They have always been closer since they are only two years apart while I have a ten and twelve year age gap with them. I used to cry because I felt so left out and ignored.

My home is my safe place and if I have friends over I feel like things will be out of my control and I can\u2019t say that I have to leave if I\u2019m feeling tired but instead I\u2019ll have to tell them to leave which seems rude. \n\nI feel so vulnerable. I always cry on my own and I\u2019m too scared to really open up and let someone in because I have been betrayed so many times in the past by people I genuinely trusted. It\u2019s hurts.

I will tell my history. I'm writing this at 4:46 AM on January 24, 2020. Well, I think all of this has began at early 2019. Before It all. I has to introduce myself right? My name...Well, I won't tell it. You can call me as you wish. Born early 2000s. I live in Brazil. Let's go. Like I said before, everything has start at all early 2019 (I guess). I start to imaginating me fucking with some people especially my nieces one is a kid and another a baby and I cumming on it. This impacted me...you now? Suicide. But this happen to another people why this impacted me? I imaginated me having a pee pee on my friend's girlfriend. Have a period of time that I imaginated people without their eyes. Actually has periods that I had fear of becoming blind. I don't if is because I have made jokes about a \"friend\" that have one eye blind. He have his moments of stupid speech but this don't justified what I have done. Have a time that I watched Gotham (2014) that Is a tv show. There is a Joker on the series, and for a period I wanted to be him, kill people you know? Why? Why? Why? Have a time in mid 2018 that I was in conflict religiously. I wanted to know that If god or satan really exist. I guess that I've prayed for my mom die? I've prayed to rain? For both? You know now I'm in conflict with the numbers 12 and 18. My nieces have been born in years that ends there. I don't know what to do. I am racist? I can't have a relationship with women. Well, once I was masturbating and when I was going to thought the name of my niece. Once I was watching porn and remembered of the name of father of my friend. It happens with one of nieces too. I think it's because the father of my friend will become our neighbor (I guess) And I have interect with my niece then this happens. And I always hated to interect with children. And this had happens. I start to hate recently my family. Seems like that the universe want me to die. I had for a period bipolarity once I was happy then sad. I have social anxiety. My life sucks. And I'm only 17. Seems like nothing is real. Some days ago I've dreamed that I was fucking with my mother. This is because that have porn video that have this genre. I start to believe that I would live a 2nd life because I want to be happy but I can't anymore. I must believe that this is a disease/mental illness because If it won't means that... I don't know actually what that means. Help me please. I'm afraid of taking a bus to search for work and lost my self. I read something I think I'm dumb and must die. Well on 5th grade I hit my self with books then... I thought I'll kill myself with overdose. But now any way must work. And more and more world goes crazy I thought kill myself is the best. I f you could help, I'll be grateful. You know what happens with guys like me on prision i saying about what ive imaginated. If you could help, I'll be grateful. I thought if i was in prision i would kill a police guard and laugh just to the others dont hurt me. People says, \"Death shouldn't have to be an option\", read this fucking history about me. Do you think that I have a chance? The shame of having a mental illness unknown, is bigger than me. If you could help, I'll be grateful. Ps: i've written this on my smartphone on my bed. I don't know why I've said this (PS) The imaginations has happen equal to animals, dog. I don't know why but i like me doing cool things, i imaginated me likle satan, lucifer, king of hell, prince. Maybe because i watched lucifer or like devil may cry. Watched dmc5 recently. Every day i think on suicide. I don't know if this is sad. Once on tv i saw a childhood abuse case and i didn't feel empathy (I guess)&gt; Some time I feel empathy principal when i was reading comic books. Even when people are bad with me I imaginated them in a dangerous situation but I feel bad and save them. It happens with my brother. Mom and Papa too. Shame of being a member of my fmaily.

I'm almost having a panic attack, running to the toilet and almost threw up. I'm standing there trying to sum up what just happened, I'm shaking and I'm crying. I'm going back to the bedroom and tell him \"I just had a terrible thought, it said that I don't love you. But I love you, I love you so so much.\" I'm still crying and shaking. I don't want to think about it anymore. I ask him if this scares him, he says no. I don't know how to feel about it, it somehow calms me, because I think if he isn't worried about me not loving him, why should I?\nBut this thought just won't leave me alone. I think if I'll just sleep this feeling will be gone in the morning. I'm wrong (f*ck). I can't sleep, so he watches some stupid stuff on YouTube with me. It helps for the moment, but as soon as the distraction is gone the feeling is back. I feel nauseous.

Anybody he tried to rape would gladly give him consent. They wouldn't fight back not even a little push, the only words that escaped their mouth were \"harder\", \"harder\". Sometimes the women would even slip their numbers into his pockets which would horrify him later at home. Life was harsh, all he wanted was forbidden and violent pleasures but instead was greeted by the embrace of countless broads of all shapes and sizes, races and religions. That was a rapist's greatest nightmare and he had to live it over and over every day of his life. So one day he decided he could not endure this agony of not being spat on no more and decided to end his life by sawing his face off but alas he survived. So now when you see a faceless man walk up to you under the pale moonlight ready to lunge on you, remember to give him the fight of his life. So when the cold wind blows and moonlight pierces the clouds the handsome rapist always wants to be disallowed.", "title": "The Fanciable Rapist."}, {"created_utc": 1580933920, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/ezfo7u/my_crush_turned_out_to_be_gay/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "Yup, I got one of those.

I have felt this way for a long time and it has really hit full swing recently. I usually keep a lot of this to myself, but I just don't care anymore. Here is a complete vent of my life.\nI was born into a broken home, but unlike most split families neither of my parents tried to make it work, they always kept finding ways to use me to get back at each other or drag me around like I was their prized accomplishment. I didn't have many friends my age growing up because of this. While most kids my age would be doing their own thing, usually hanging out with each other, I was instead hanging out with my mom's friends, and I didn't have a choice to say no. My dad was way different, instead of forcing me to hang out with his friends, I was forced to live in the same house as the new woman he married. When my father remarried, I didn't give a shit, I thought I was getting an extension of my family, I thought it was going to be great. I couldn't have been further from the truth, whenever I went over to my dad's his new wife would lash out at me in any way she could. She treated me like I was a plague on humanity, she would constantly find ways to fuck with me every time I went over there, and this was usually achieved by her complaining to my father about every little thing I did wrong. This would only make him angry, and I would suffer his full wrath. Even when she wasn't doing that, she would also never talk to me unless she wanted to criticize me for something. She only ever showed me disgust, every time she looked at me she looked disgusted, she did this since I was 5 years old and it continues to this day. And I couldn't avoid going over there either, because my father would always throw a hissy fit and take my mom to court if he missed out on one day of Visitation. The best part is, it gets fucking worse. After 10 years of dealing with this, my mother decided that it was time to move all the way across the bay so that she wouldn't have to drive as much to get to her office. Only problem was, now instead of her having to travel the distance, I had to travel that distance every single time I had to go to my father's, with the same shit waiting for me every single time. So now, I am not only dealing with the shit at my dad's house, but I also have to cross the goddamn Death Stranding to get to it. Plus, at this time I had to say goodbye to the 2 people I considered my best and only friends. One of them moved to Australia and I was moving away from the other. After all that, I go to middle school in a new town and things start looking up. Sure I have to deal with everything from before, but now I have made some new friends who are my age, I am hanging out with them, I'm starting to go outside more, what could possibly go wrong? 2 years pass, and it's time for high school. Shit hits the fan almost immediately, all my new friends I had made are gone (moved, different school, etc.)  my parents get into a legal battle over child support, I am miserable in my new school, and I am sitting there thinking to myself \"What the fuck just happened?\" I didn't adjust to high school very well, I made zero friends at my first school and I eventually transferred to another school. The court case finally settled and I thought everything could only get better from there. And then my father is hospitalized, he had been infected by a rare subspecies of a fungus that was very hard to treat as my dad was the 9th person to ever be infected. Due to his weak kidney, the hospital had to be careful with the amount of antibiotics they could give him to treat the fungus. I thought my father was going to die, and I felt like it was my fault. I knew at the time that after a stressful event people could be more prone to infections, and it happened so quickly after the court settlement I had believed that I killed my dad. He couldn't walk without support, there was danger of it spreading to his brain, we didn't know what antibiotics to use and we couldn't test too many because of his kidney. Needless to say, it was the scariest moment of my life. So what does his wife do? She mentions that court case every time she can because she knew how guilty I felt about it, she knew that I thought I killed my dad. She didn't even have to have an arguement anymore, she could just say \"Well you took your dad to court\" and it would shut me up. When my dad was finally released from the hospital, I had just transferred to my new school. It was at this point that I stopped caring about what happened to me. Throughout High School, I didn't really make any friends, just acquaintances. I was that one kid that everyone knew, but didn't hang out with. At one point, I noticed that I started looking at guys the same way I looked at girls. I kept this to myself for a while, I knew it would be a shock to my dad if I ever told him. Right before I was going to tell my dad, my step sister (wife's daughter, not my dad's) came out as a lesbian, but said she was bi first. So now if I told my dad I was bi, he would immediately assume I was gay, and I would have no way to convince him otherwise. This would probably destroy my relationship with my dad, as I am an only child, my dad wants me to carry on the family bloodline. So I held onto this until Junior year and when I told my mom she didn't know what to say. She was shocked, and I don't think she understand what being bi was necessarily. It took a little explaining, but she was ok with it in the end. I never told my dad. I finally graduate high school, and things really begin to get better for once. I began to go to community college, I actually got to make friends there, I finally had some independence, I got a job, and things were looking brighter. This leads us to present day, and I should be feeling happy. But I'm not, I feel just as miserable as ever. I got what I wanted, but I don't feel any happier. Today, for no reason I got so sad and tired that when I got home, I couldn't leave my bed for a solid hour, mainly because I didn't want to. When I finally could move, all these memories just came flooding back. I wanted to get these all down, maybe I'll feel better after doing this. I'm going to check in with a therapist if it doesn't. I'm not suicidal, I just wish that a meteor would hit me so I could stop thinking about all this.", "title": "A Complete Vent of my Life"}, {"created_utc": 1580806022, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/eyn7iz/my_dog_died/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "My dog died"}, {"created_utc": 1580805256, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/eyn3jt/just_ignore_me_im_just_in_my_feels_i_been/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Just ignore me.

It\u2019s a long ass post. It\u2019s 2am and I just need something off my chest and people I normally talk to are asleep so I\u2019m just venting to myself I guess. Just scroll past lmao. It\u2019s just a stupid nonsensical rant. \n\n10 years ago I met a girl. I met a friend. I made a friend to be exact. Which for me was something new. Shit at the time I don\u2019t even know if I did actually make a friend. Eventually we did things that qualified as friends but were we friends at the time? I\u2019m not sure. I sure do hope so though. But I digress. \n\nTen years ago this year I met a girl. I met her in physics. She was smart. Kind. She hung around people I did not. Our social groups were far from connected. The only connection at the time was Physics. Those who had the pleasure of having Mr. Mezini as a teacher know that as a class you had a bond. And this bond was tight for the semester and only lasted till the end of it. But within this class bond, another bond was formed. One that carried on after the semester. This girl and I spoke. I made her laugh and she made me laugh. We would say hi to one another and she would help me because she was smarter. She understood better. She also tried harder so that attributed to her success in the course. Me. Well I was me. Dumbass \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. But anyway our bond grew over the years. Eventually I formed new social groups that at one point melded with hers. And a tighter connection was formed. At some point without hesitation I called her my friend. Which for me at the time was hard to do. \n\nI completed all four years of middle school at Brennan but being a \u201cfriend\u201d was out of the question. I did whatever I could to isolate myself. I helped the janitor. I sat at the \u201cpopular\u201d table when I wasn\u2019t and had people hate me for it. I did things to be obnoxious. Ultimately I reached my goal and became known as annoying. Even hated by many. And that\u2019s what I wanted. Loneliness. I wanted to be alone. No one to care about me so I didn\u2019t have to care about them. Because I felt if I THOUGHT someone cared about me and I was wrong, well then shit all I was doing was breaking my own heart. So why go through that trauma. Why not avoid it. And I did it the best way I knew how. I fought with the teachers. I used pen in math. Told my ELA teacher reading was useless and for dummies. I pissed off anyone and everyone except for one teacher. One teacher who ultimately changed my life. But this isn\u2019t about her. No. It\u2019s about how I tried to be lonely so that I wouldn\u2019t be hurt. I failed. I cared about people. And they cared for me. But I could never succumb to calling them my \u201cfriends\u201d. My past always had me on edge. Always thinking \u201cI\u2019m going to move away soon. If I have no friends I won\u2019t be sad because I won\u2019t miss anyone\u201d. I spent all middle school this way. \n\nBut again, then came high school. Things changed. This one girl became my first friend. And we had many classes. Because of her I decided to try harder and be better. And I did. I knew I had potential and I made it. This girl not only was a friend and inspiration but she was something more. She was a type of Joy. A joy I never experienced. I never once had so much fun by arguing with someone. But like intellectual arguments. It was funny. Over the years we became good friends. Calculus was a major point. She became one of my best friends. \n\nI cried to her when I couldn\u2019t cry alone. I told her how I felt. My feelings. I opened up in ways I never thought I ever would to another human being. For her I attained empathy. Which was a strange experience. Seeing someone cry, I never felt empathy. Sympathy sure. But never empathy. Never for any emotion. For anyone. Except her. The first time I saw her cry my heart just felt like someone squeezing it to a point where it could not be squeezed anymore, yet it too could neither pop. I cried. I felt sad because she was sad. It was strange to me. \n\nYes I had other friends. Yes I had other people who meant something to me. But she was technically the first \u201cfriend\u201d. At the time she may have not been a friend but she was the closest I ever got to one come freshman year of high school. \n\nAnd this is no disrespect to people who I\u2019ve known since middle and elementary school. I liked you all but I never really felt much more until high school. But I digress again. \n\nThis girl was a best friend of mine for years. And I never felt anything more than that. She opened my world up to new experiences. Amusement parks. Birthday parties that weren\u2019t of family. Going on road trips. Sleepovers. Staying up all night just talking on the phone about random shit avoiding sleep. Skipping stones. Going to a zoo. Getting on a fucking roller coaster. There\u2019s so much small shit that I experienced with her that to most people it\u2019s normal. Well, my normal and you\u2019re normal were no where near normal. \n\nI learned to care and feel. And empathize. And just so much. So much that till this day I could not thank her enough for everything. But that leads me to the point of this whole rant. I couldn\u2019t thank her. I can\u2019t tell her how she changed my life. We no longer talk. \n\nShe took someone who was afraid to live and love and try new things and without knowing LITERALLY changed my life. \n\nImagine having someone, who introduced you to the things like a party. A sleepover. A Christmas party. A New Years party. A birthday party for friends. Making seasonal cookies. Sneaking out. Staying up late. Challenging someone intellectually. Having legitimate debates. Eating pie. Drinking Snapple\u2019s. Simple shit that individually could make no difference but accumulated changed my who fucking life. Someone who showed you, you could love someone without it being romantic. And then showing you how to actually love someone romantically. Introducing a whole new world after that. \n\nMy life was FLOURISHING because of one person and she didn\u2019t know it. To her she was doing normal things. To me, it was a whole new world. \n\nFreshman year to junior year my live changed dramatically yeah. But nothing compared to senior year and the months following. Fall 2013 to summer 2014 was INCREDIBLE. But that was nothing compared to Summer 2014. Summer 2014 was better than my entire existence up to that point. All because of one girl. I truly ended up falling in love. To the point. I literally understood the phrase of loving someone enough to let them go. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. Shit went down. And my life went down in a dark spiral. \n\nImagine meeting someone who changed the entirety of your life. And you had to be the one to take that person out of your life. Take them out because they taught you how to not be selfish and you had to let them go in order to not be selfish. And they have no idea. \n\nImagine growing up CERTAIN YOU WERE GOING TO LIVE AND DIE ALONE, and to have just one person trigger a ripple effect and change that certainty of loneliness, to being certain that certainty was no longer a possibility, no longer anywhere near certain. \n\nImagine being in the brink of darkness and someone without knowing brings you to a warm light away from the brink just by being the good soul they are. And then having to walk away from them because staying would cause that soul to no longer be as pure. \n\nImagine being that lonely kid you see on the playground or read about in books, and becoming the happily ever after you hoped they\u2019d reach, then having to walk away from it because...... because..... well. It was the right thing to fucking do. \n\nI\u2019ve never had to do such a hard thing in my life. Walk away from happiness. \n\nPeople are great at hiding emotions. Some people are bad liars. Some are awful liars. Some can\u2019t fucking lie. But everyone can hold their own secret. The one secret that is only for them. I had mine. I was alone. And finally was happy. And it wasn\u2019t because of me. It was because of someone else and I had to let them go. \n\nAnd I know this is redundant. That\u2019s the point, to emphasize how traumatic and painful and hard and heart wrenching it was to do it. To let go because of not they would be in your position before you met them. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t because we were bad together. Or because we had differences. It was really because they were going to be in a place where I once was. They were going to lose their best friend because of me. And I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m worth that much. \n\nSo I made the decision to let go because she couldn\u2019t. I had to make the tough decision. \n\nBut she promised to stay my friend. To be there. And I believed her. But as time went on I began to regress. I lost the happiness. I was going dark again and in my desperation I tried to cling on to dear life to her. And I fucked it all up. I truly isolated myself. I lost many friends because of something I did. I made myself lonely. It was my fault I lost a best friend. One in a different league. \n\nI finally trusted people. Finally opened up. Because of one person. \n\nAnd I myself, lost that person. \n\nI was a wreck. A mess. A catastrophe. And it was my fault. Trying to do something good and I made it as worse as possible for myself. \n\nI don\u2019t even know how to put into words what I\u2019m trying to say. Simply it\u2019s,\n\nHave you ever finally found your peace\nAnd by your own hand destroyed it trying to help another keep their peace?  \n\nIt\u2019s devastating. 5 going one 6 years later, she had found her peace it seems. She\u2019s happy. \n\nAnd two nights ago I dreamt a horrid dream. I dreamt of her. And I the dream there was a disconnect between her and I. For the first time in my dreams, it was no longer a cherished memory. It was new. It was unknown. We did not know how to greet each other or walk side by side nor converse. It was as though we had forgotten about how one another just lives. And it has bother me. \n\nHas she forgotten me? Am I forgotten? I never told her how she made such an impact. Am I just another \u201csomeone I knew in high school\u201d? Am I another \u201cjust some guy I dated\u201d? Am I just another name without a face anymore because it\u2019s been so long?  \n\nIt hurts to think that. That someone who meant so much to me could possibly no longer remember me if she hasn\u2019t already forgotten. \n\nIs this chapter closed for her? Gone with the wind? Am I just another spec now in her life? Just a little blip on her timeline? \n\nIf I am then shit, my purpose in her life is over. And damn that sucks. It\u2019s sucks badly to think about. That\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to say. Losing one of your best friends sucks, especially because you never told them they were such a best friend. Damn near not giving them a reason to remember you. \n\nThat\u2019s it. End of rant. Good night.", "title": "Just ignore me. I\u2019m just in my feels. I been drinking too.

Which is the wrong thing to do. Once again, trust me. Never throw yourself away to obtain someone. You\u2019ll most likely lose them and ultimately yourself. \n\nWhen she left my heart didn\u2019t beat for months. When I mean things were dark I mean they were jet black. I felt suicidal, depressed, anxious, lost 20lbs and even felt physically sore. Hardest thing was there was no one to blame but myself because I\u2019m the one that hurt her. I began to love her more than myself? Pitiful. She needed a rock but I became dust. I need myself to be whole but I dripped empty. \n\nI was blocked by her on just about everything. At first it felt like the end of the world, but now? Now, I want to thank her. It\u2019s helped me. Why would I want to see her out drinking and partying with other guys? (Yes she posted about every guy in her grasp) What would I gain from that? \n\nWhat helped me feel better? Religion and realizing if she comes back she comes back but if not I will find someone better. Guys, the more you pull the harder she pushes. If you truly love her just respect her feelings. Not even for just her but for your own sake. \n\nLastly, look I haven\u2019t found anyone yet. She hasn\u2019t reached out yet. You know what though? I feel better. I\u2019m getting better. I feel more wise and I love myself more than ever. If I loved myself with her she wouldn\u2019t be gone. Can\u2019t cry over spilled milk my friends.

Many don\u2019t believe in Jesus but wether you like it or not life comes quick and with purpose. Maybe this was suppose to happen to fix/mature me? Or maybe it was for me to become a better man for her when she returns. Who knows? I could not even care about her next week or next month.

I literally tried avoid being hit and hide because I knew this would happen and turns out it still did. It\u2019s not like I could\u2019ve been dramatic and refused to do it, like I wanted to lmao. This has been worsening for 4 years and made me unable to breathe with my nose for a good few years until I realised ok this is getting ridiculous there is something seriously wrong. \n\nPuberty also messed me up. I\u2019m trans and would of gone on puberty blockers had I lived anywhere else but the Uk. Even if I did come out, I still would\u2019ve had like 5 years wait until I can get anything like that. I was 14 when I knew and so I would\u2019ve needed my parents to apply to the child clinic and by the time the wait was over for that they\u2019d refuse to see me because I\u2019m to old and I\u2019d be put on the adult waiting list for another 3 years. So now I need so many expensive procedures to try undo that, like brow bone reduction, laser hair removal, hairline lowering etc but it was mental torture and I just thought the nose also was puberty because I blamed that on a lot of the changes. But now I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be naturally pretty like I could\u2019ve had I not got hit by a damn ball fml. Also there\u2019s things that can\u2019t be changed like my height or it being more of an effort to sound feminine etc.\n\nAs a result of not being able to be myself due to family trying to hide it; giving me debilitating shame out of nowhere and being severely targeted at school almost everyday by complete strangers (also a teacher once infront of everyone) and the changes in how I look, I think the stress of it all developed bipolar 2 and that made me make even more wrong decisions and be highly all over the place. It\u2019s not as bad now I realise that\u2019s what it is though. I also could not walk past people a lot of the time without getting severely anxious and weird sharp pain in my face because it was so common to be harassed and I was uptight as a result. I also started really unhealthy binge eating habits when I started feeling suicidal like 3 years ago because I really did give up once I cut my hair because of the constant pressure and insecurity over it because I couldn\u2019t have it how I wanted without my family realising my scenario. So i essentially had a double life and hid so much which made it hard to fully commit like I would\u2019ve. So I was kind\u2019ve an embarassing inbetween mess and that made me targeted even more.. also me hiding made me not share my nose concerns as I thought it was puberty and I didn\u2019t want them to think I was concerned with it not looking as pretty + I was to insecure to be in public and so didn\u2019t want to see a doctor. Also I just thought I got ill and congested a lot due to my poor diet and the depression but I did infect have a problem with my nose. \n\nSo yeah I genuinely am unsure if I can recover, I pray my nosejob can completely correct it back to before, then I will have more hope. And I have been fighting for what seems my entire life to get on hormones. Honestly over it all at this point. Also I\u2019ve been saving money my entire life instead of doing a lot of things knowing I\u2019d need surgeries to undo what I have been made to go through. But legit the nose job will cost more than I\u2019ve saved my entire life and it\u2019s really put it into perspective, I was so focused on the wrong things and how ridiculous it is I thought I could magically undo it all instantly and be able to afford it somehow. When I haven\u2019t pursued things that could\u2019ve helped me and also long ambitions of mine because I am so insecure now  and don\u2019t feel like myself whatsoever. And I still can\u2019t come out to parents. 1) because I want them to help with fixing my face first non transgender wise like my nose. 2) it will be like calling them awful parents for how they treated the entire thing + It feels pointless now because I legit wanted to run away and cut all contact for yesrs, I can\u2019t really see myself being close with them now tho after it feeling like my life is over and how I wish they paid attention to my basic wellbeing instead of trying to force me to be masculine.. \n\nBut yeah I can\u2019t see a future for me without like 25k in debt for my face and probably more than that for body if I decide to.

She told her daughter that my project, in which I gathered data from 40 students in my school, dumb. She told her daughter that her project, an un-original one we see every year, is way better then even the grand champions. Back to the chat. I woke up to a message that said if I continued sending \"inappropriate content\" I would no longer be allowed to talk to her. Now, what was this inappropriate content? For one, me mis-typing lol into l9l. This apparently means something that I was not aware of. It was a very common typo. So common she thought I was doing it on purpose. Now, the harambe meme. We all love harambe, so on his birthday I sent her a wholesome meme. Guess what? Her Karen of a mother saw that meme, and she must have spent HOURS researching harambe until she came to the dark side of the meme. Lastly, a link to a meme on reddit r/pewdiepie submissions.

I just need an anonymous outlet to let it out and this seems like as good as any\n\n1. My boss fired me because I was the only employee that wasn\u2019t too scared to stand up to him (and I even did it politely). I literally built his company for him and went so far above and beyond - picked him up from the hospital when he overdosed on cocaine (for just one example). I was underpaid for all the work I put in and I saw the ad he put up for my replacement - he is paying them $17,000 less per year! Good luck... no one even knows all the stuff I did to make that company run well and run legally. I constantly took on tasks from others because they were high stress and I knew it would ease their minds.\n\nHe had been making the work environment miserable for a while to the point that all the employees are scared to turn on the air conditioning when its hot because he might throw a temper tantrum about  us spending his money (even though he frivolously spends on useless junk all the time and being a comfortable temperature is pretty essential). \n\n2. We\u2019re in the middle of the worst unemployment and now I have to tell interviews that I was fired and everywhere on the internet says that no matter what you shouldn\u2019t talk badly about your prior boss. \n\nI fucked up my first interview, which was for the job I was most looking forward to. I\u2019ve since refined what to say but it still sucks. I had an interview at a second job that didn\u2019t really appeal to me but a job is a job right now \u2014 the first interview went super well but the second one (today) seemed to go pretty badly.\n\n3. I am a super extrovert so quarantining after work at my last job (my boss considered us essential even though we probably weren\u2019t - but I didn\u2019t complain bc I loved even the minor human interaction) was bad enough. But now I\u2019ve just been locked away and lonely with no one to be with and spend time with. I never thought I would hate living alone but here it is.\n\n4. This is probably what I\u2019m most sad about even though it\u2019s probably the least worthy (disclaimer, I am social distancing except for from 2 people who are also social distancing from all others): \n\nI started seeing a guy in December of last year. The first 2 months we were together were the best I\u2019ve ever experienced (and I tend to date pretty good guys overall). We had this insane connection like nothing I\u2019ve ever felt... not even close. It completely changed me.\n\nThe only problem was that I had just gotten out of a relationship and was not ready to settle down again yet. Then at the end of January, we had a big-ish fight the night before I was leaving town for the weekend. Over that weekend, I realized how important he was to me and that he was worth the commitment.\n\nAt the same time, he apparently realized the opposite. Things completely changed and over the next 2 months, he didn\u2019t kiss me the same (or at all really) or look at me the same and that crazy connection just vanished. In its place, he claimed that our basically just-friendship was better because it was a \u201cmore mature\u201d growing relationship. I was so lost and missed the thing that had changed my life so much. I couldn\u2019t handle it. We would have such a good time every time we hung out but there would be no sex and there was just this huge emotion missing from him that was still radiating through me. After we would spend time together I would stupidly, but imo a little understandably, break down to him... I just couldn\u2019t understand how he just turned off such a powerful emotion. I still can\u2019t understand how one fight completely ruined everything.\n\nLogically I know that he clearly never felt the same way about me as I did about him, but I can\u2019t make my brain believe it because I can remember seeing into his soul the way he looked at me and the things he said and did with me. I never believed that you could \u201clook into someone\u2019s soul\u201d or any of that sappy bullshit but here I am knowing it\u2019s real and it happened. And worst: knowing that I\u2019ll probably never see it or feel it or have that warmth and love wrap around my soul ever again.\n\nFast forward to last weekend. He\u2019d been avoiding me but still wanting to text often and finally after I explained that I\u2019m not just going to text and not see him \u2014 he said he didn\u2019t want a relationship. fine. That was the whole problem in the first place and I never wanted one. We hung out Friday and had the best time (as usual). We were intoxicated and he was being loving and even bringing up how we met and other sappy stories. I was determined to be chill after (no text break downs) and we had many lovely conversations at the beginning of the week and even spoke on the phone. It made my heart sing. But I stopped texting him Wednesday and he hasn\u2019t even reached out at all since. Not to mention that we used to hate spending even a couple days apart and it\u2019s now been a week. And again - we are only 4 months in... honeymoon period should definitely not be over already.\n\nI\u2019m trying to remind myself that he did nothing for my birthday, basically abandoned me in my time of need when I was so hurt about losing my job... but I\u2019m just so stuck on the ghost from the first 2 months. I mean obviously that\u2019s not who he is..... but it was. And that man would have cared for me through all of this. \n\nAgain, his love changed me at my core. I didn\u2019t know that was even possible (and I have dated and loved plenty). I don\u2019t know how to get over it... I don\u2019t know how to move on. It doesn\u2019t feel possible (also never felt this way before).\n\nDuring this time, my ex has been a rock for me. Neither of us necessarily want to get back together, but we still love each other and he has come over and held me while I\u2019ve sobbed for hours (I am not a cryer) and taken care of me when I\u2019ve been not eating because I\u2019m so emotional. \n\nI\u2019m lost. I feel broken and unrepairable. If I get a job it will just be a bandaid to cover a gunshot.\n\nI know obviously that eventually I\u2019ll move on but that almost hurts worse. The only way to move on is to forget the best feeling I\u2019ve ever felt. To forget what that love feels like. And a life without that feeling just feels less worthy now that I know what I\u2019m missing.", "title": "In A Bad Headspace"}, {"created_utc": 1587751643, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/g7dbnj/thinking_about_every_girl_who_rejected_me/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "Today's quarentine emotion is just feeling the potential of each girl who has rejected me in high school.

I was wondering how old they are to make sure I wasn't talking to a bunch of 7 year olds so I asked them \"How old are you guys because if you guys are children I'm gonna feel so disgusting\". Now later I regret saying this because I sounded like an old person and I should have worded it better. But anyway, the one girl I became really good friends with got uncomfortable and blocked me. I talked with one of the other girls and told her I was sorry If I creeped them out and I was just wandering if they're little kids. Well she assured me they weren't and the proceeded to ask for my age. I was kinda skeptical because she's a stranger for one and I was afraid she was gonna lie. Anyway we got into little bit of an argument about it then I told her my age. She said she was the same age and then I apologized again for the way I worded what I said. I said good night and then I come back 2 minutes later and she blocked me. I was really confused. Then like 5 minutes later, her other friend confronted me and I said I was just wondering if they were little kids and I meant no harm. Well she blocked me too. Anyway I know this is really childish and dumb but they were what kept me happy during this quarantine. I have no way of contacting them and I know there's nothing I can do.

We talked for almost everyday for a whole year, and we even had plans together when we go back home, I caught some feelings toward her again. \n\nThe time came we both have to go back home to our town, and then we did. We had some chances that we hang out or even jog together, but something changed. Every time I invite her to jog or if she wants to hang out, she just declines. I don't know why!? But we don't talk the way we used to anymore. As days go by, she seems got colder and colder towards me.

It feels like everyday I have nothing to look forward to. Me and my girlfriend broke up about a month ago. And I still haven't recovered. We dated for four months, which isn't much but I genuinely mean it when I say I've never felt that way about somebody before. Mind you I haven't had much relationships so. We knew each other for almost a year before we started dating. The bond was unmatched by anybody else I've ever met. I got along with her so quickly it felt immediate. When we started dating it felt so natural. Like it was meant to be sort of thing you know? The whole thing felt like a romantic movie. On May 22nd 2020 she texted me, she said the usual like I miss you too and do you want to FaceTime. But she was very distant that week. Except for Monday and Tuesday. Monday was when we hit 4 months. Tuesday we talked like normal, Wednesday Thursday she was very distant. I asked her if everything was okay and she said \"yeah we're good\" and that's when I knew something was up. I asked if she's sure and that I'm quite scared, she said that we needed to talk. And then that's when she broke up with me. She said it just wasn't feeling the same, which hurt a lot. (And yes, I made sure and she wasn't catching feelings for anybody else.) I thought it was going absolutely perfect. She said for now she doesn't think we should be friends. She thinks that if we become friends the whole cycle will repeat itself. And we haven't talked for weeks. Well, we have talked a little bit but not like a full conversation. Like what we used to have. I'm not a very religious person but I believe something is up there. And I feel like nothing is listening to me anymore. I would stay up nights crying begging for whoever it was to not take her away from me. That I don't want anything better and that it's perfect already. And there he or she goes taking her away. The only person I genuinely wanted to spend my life with. She told me that we don't know what the future holds. Which is true. We do need quite a bit of space. But I just miss her. It's to the point where I can't even look at my room the same way. Because we always hung out there. I can't look at my front porch the same because that's where we last hung out because of social distancing. That's another thing that hurts, I didn't even get to kiss her goodbye one last time. I can't look at the mall the same way because that's where our first date was, I can't even look at my basement the same way. That sounds weird but my basement always used to be my FaceTiming spot, because I had the best lighting. And when we facetimed that's where a lot of our amazing memories were. Sorry about the long post. But like I said in the beginning, every day I would look forward to talking to her. Now feels like I have nothing to look forward to.

My parents treat me like a child. Let's go back 15 years ago, so you can get where I'm coming from first. When I was a teenager, my mom would call me fat, monster, ugly creature. She would give me food and say \"here, get poisoned\" she would tell me \"I wish you were dead\". \n\nI was never even fat. I've never been fat in my life. The most I ever weighed as a teen was maybe 48kg.\n\nMy dad wasn't really involved in the parenting. He used to play boardgames with me, but that's all about it. He works hard to provide for us. So he never really said anything about that, but he would sometimes say insulting things himself. I remember vividly when I was 6 years old, at the beach, on a vacation. I told my dad \"I wanna change the world and make peace\" so told me \"you are nothing. You live in a cave right now, you cant see anything. You will never do anything that will change anything. You're just dust\" while he's right, nobody really says this to a child. \n\n\nBack to the present. My mom changed in terms of her name calling and such. She stopped doing that after I gruaduated school. I live on my own now in a city an hour away from parents. Every little fart I pass, my mom must know about it. She texts all day and calls every day. She asks details. If I don't answer for 10 mins, she spams calls, she calls on apps. While I'm probably simply taking a shower. I call her back, she's pissed yelling where have you been. \n\nBoth mom and dad call me stupid still from time to time. I'm a teacher with a double major degree from one of the best universities in my country. They always thought my majors are useless. Never really cared about them, although they did pay all the funds and my rent while I was a student. \nThey belittle my job because the pay is low. They compare me to my uneducated cousin who does nailart saying she makes more money (which she does, but they are insulting me). \n\nI tried to finally speak up today, they started telling me I'm ungrateful, while stating the things they did/still do for me. \nI lashed out. Threw my food on the floor. Left to my room and starting crying for everything that's ever happened. Then I felt realllly bad. I felt bad because I might have hurt them. I love them. They are everything to me. Without them I am nothing. I don't want them to feel bad about this or lose sleep. But I am hurt and sick of everything.

But because of the Coronavirus, we will have to postpone the wedding until August, which will actually ruin the whole anniversary wedding and the counting of the years etc....it is very heartbreaking because we're almost only a month away...now we are 5 months away.

We stayed in touch and met once again at the end of the year when I travelled to her country.\n\nDuring the second half of 2019, we got in touch again and started text almost every day and have occasional scheduled calls. While we still lived far away, I felt there was a connection between us and the conversations have always been\u2026 natural, raw and personal. As we grew closer, I picked up the courage to do things that I hoped would show how I felt, such as sending her a gift on her birthday, which she seemed to love. I\u2019ve been honest about how I thought she was special and amazing - although I never said \u201cI like you\u201d.\n\nThen, we met again in Christmas 2019 when I travelled to her place again. At this point, I started to really like her but was unsure of what would happen with the distance - and the fact that there\u2019s no chance of us moving closer to each other in the next 2 years at least. We went out a few times and had the best time. I did what I thought would show how I felt - flowers, gifts with handwritten notes, picked up the tabs and planned the dates to her liking. By this point, it was clear that both of us really enjoyed each other\u2019s company. She has always been receptive of my advances and said she had lovely time with me, asked me to visit often.\n\nI was still hesitant to tell her outright I liked her, as I was still hoping there would come a day in which we\u2019ll live in the same city together, and I\u2019d stand a better chance then. Throughout our interaction, I've felt she's not the type who could do a long-distance. I was trying to make an arrangement in which I would live closer to her for a few months mid-year and wanted to use the momentum to tell her then.\n\nAnyway, after returning home, we still texted. I did a couple more things to keep keep the \u201csparks\u201d, e.g. sending flowers to her office, which she said she liked!\u00a0\n\nHowever, several weeks in, things turned different. After she came back from a trip to visit her parents, her schedules had turned busy with work and other commitments, and she started responding less. I didn\u2019t have any reason to believe that she didn\u2019t want to speak with me - everything was going well just before that. I didn\u2019t hear back for a couple of weeks, couldn\u2019t call her. Finally managed to hear back. She said she\u2019d been hectic so wasn\u2019t able to text anymore. I was surprised so decided to tell her outright how I felt. She then said she just wanted to be friends and saw me as a friend/brother figure and that she doesn't want me to waste my effort/time. I was surprised because she never referred to me as a \"friend\".\n\nI've been replaying this to figure out if there was anything I could have done to save the situation.

She was my roommate and we were very close. I was good friends with all my roommates when this started, we were a tight knit bunch and 2 of them I would really consider were my best friends. \n\nI got a boyfriend. One roommate started acting weird, hostile, talking behind my back, starting fights for things that shouldn't be fights. It took a toll on my mental health and I decided to move out and make my life easier also in hopes of repairing the relationship. Before I moved out the relationship was beyond repair and I just didn't want to know her anymore.\n\nAnother roommate was/is my closest friend. We would tell each other everything. She stresses about school a lot so at first after I moved out when she didn't contact me too much I thought she was drowning under work and I understood. It's been over 3 months since the move now and she hasn't contacted me on her own since. I have been initiating all contact because I don't want to lose her and what we had. My apartment is on the way home to hers and she hasn't set foot in it once. We made plans once for her to come over but she bailed. I texted her around half an hour after she was supposed to be there and she left me hanging for 2/3 hours before she texted me back. She had a deadline (which i understand) but hadn't bothered to inform me she wasn't coming (which I don't). I felt disrespected, as if my time wasn't valuable but I chalked it up to her being spacey sometimes. I texted her during spring break asking her if she wanted to go clubbing and it was only then that I found out she was in Mexico with my other roommate. I was so hurt that she hadn't at least mentioned it to me, because we were so close and I thought that she would at least tell me about new and exciting things in her life. I feel discarded. Then, today I found out she wasn't going to a dance that I had thought she was going to and was instead staying home with the same roommate she went to Mexico with to have fun on their own, because she doesn't think it's wise to go with coronavirus and all that. The roommate I had previously distanced myself from would not be there either. She didn't bother to think about me, to invite me to something that could be fun with a mutual friend. She hasnt invited me to do anything at all with her this semester, yet she keeps in touch with her other friends. I have lived with her for a year and a half at this point and been friends for close to 3 years. I'm stunned that the phrase out of sight out of mind applies to her, I never thought it would. I thought what we had was unshakeable.\n\nI am so devastated. I feel defeated. She knows I miss her, but she's apparently just not bothered by it. I am hurting on such a deep level I cannot even begin to understand it myself. My boyfriend doesn't understand that this was not how our relationship worked. That I never would have expected this in a million years. He think I misjudged the relationship initially, that she didn't care about me the way I thought she did.

I'm new to this subreddit. Hope everyone is having a decent day. Basically, back in Year 10 (9th grade), I had a crush on this girl. Let's call her Sabrina (not her real name). We talked a lot and it felt amazing just talking to her. Few months of talking, I built up the courage to ask her out on a date (cringe). However, one of my close friends asked her out on the same day I was about to. I had to back out cuz he is my homie. Felt like shit for a couple of weeks, but I moved on from it. My friend and Sabrina dated for like 3 or 4 months. I think they broke up like 2 months before the school year ended. It's a new year; I return to school. Sabrina and I became pretty good friends. Everything was going good. She liked this dude, and I told her to ask him out. She got rejected by him, and she got sad. So I spent time with her to keep her company. Probably the biggest mistake I've done cuz I started to like her again. However, this time it wasn't like how I felt about her before, it was deeper. I felt more wholesome by being with her. I didn't tell her how I felt cuz she looked at me as a friend. I didn't want to make things weird and also didn't want to lose her by telling how I felt. More importantly, I didn't want her to feel weirded out. She shared her secrets with me. I didn't want her to lose the person she felt comfortable with for my personal interests. Hence, I didn't tell her how I felt. Another school year passes by, and one of my friends told me to risk it all and tell her how I felt. I was like, \"You know what? Fuck it!\" So I was ready to tell her how I felt. Guess what happens. One of my best friends started to date her. Yeah, I had no idea he liked her. And apparently, they started dating right after the previous school year ended. This took me out cold. This made my heartache. I felt so depressed (even though I shouldn't have). I became miserable. I can't fucking go for her when she is dating one of my best friends. It took me about 2 months to get over that. But at least I managed to get over it. We remained as friends. My friend is still dating her (sort of). A brand new school year, the last one before I graduate, just started a month ago. Sabrina and my friend claim they broke up, she started to get more friendly with me. Lo and behold, I fell for her again. However, even though she is single now, I can't ask her out. My friend still likes her and he dated her. I can't do him dirty like that. At the end of the day, it's my fucking fault. It's my fault for falling for her. It's my fault that I liked her for almost 4 years now.

In college, the fear was punishment from myself in terms of hatred for myself.\n\nSometimes, it was something more serious, like being sad from seeing my parents fight and coming to school the next day. That's even worse because I would see other kids being happy from happy homes and I'd wish I were them.\n\nNow that I'm working, I realise I suck at my job as well. I guess despite what I think about myself, I'm an average, or even, below average person at everything I do. I try hard, but I just can't bring out the results. Now the sadness is from realising how pathetic I am as an employee and that I do not deserve this salary. I am scared I'll get fired and I feel very lonely because no one else around me is this bad at their job. Everyone is just talking about fun stuff, projects they're working on, and basically, it's evident that they're not worried about their jobs or their self esteem. I am also afraid that they gossip about me behind my back. I know they don't like my department because of my boss, so I feel they'll start feeling the same way about me soon.\n\nSo, how do I deal with this loneliness? I am trying to be better at my job.

I feel so exhausted, yet I can't sleep. I just keep thinking about the memories we shared. She wasn't just a pet, she was a part of the family, and although she was only a few months with us, she grew so much on every member of the family. She was still a baby and didn't need to pass away so tragically.\n\nMy neighbor's fucking dogs killed her last night. We didn't hear anything, and she was missing since this morning. We were a bit worried, but didn't think much about it, because she used to wander off sometimes, but she always came back eventually. Not this time though... Our neighbor came by this afternoon to tell us, even though he knew it happened since last night. When I heard the news I broke down like never before. I don't think I've ever felt like this, or cried like I cried today. I was screaming and hitting the wardrobe door. I felt like there was something inside of me that I had to get out, but couldn't. And I couldn't believe it. I still don't. There's still a small dose of hope that maybe that wasn't her, and that she'll come back. Maybe if anyone from my family saw her body, I'd be able to fully believe it. But I don't think anyone could deal with that shit. It's too late now anyways, he buried her.\n\nI'm also so fucking enraged. I wanted to go and kill those bastards with my own hands, and I'm someone who loves dogs too. But those dogs are out of control. They used to be strays, and our neighbor adopted them, but he can't even fend for himself, let alone those dogs. That's why my grandma always fed those dogs with our leftovers. They're really aggressive, but they're never on a leash. The same situation is on the other end of the street, where another neighbor has a herd of aggressive 'used to be stray' dogs who are never on a leash and are a threat, not only to poor cats, but to people as well. I know our neighbor had no ill intentions, he just wanted to care for those dogs, but they were and still are endangering everyone else. I wish he'd get rid of them. And you may be thinking I'm a horrible person for wanting those dogs to be put down, but that's just how I feel right now. \n\nMy baby was a rescue too. She was so small when I found her, and I just brought her to our home to feed her. I had no intentions of keeping her, because I knew my parents were against having pets, because they're too much work. But we noticed her leg was hurt, so we let her stay. And we cared for her. She recovered quickly and grew up in a lovely, playful cat.

With that, our friends went to her aid and left me altogether. No one talked to me anymore, and when they (literally just one person) did, they always brought her up and basically made me their Plan B friend when my ex wasn\u2019t available. \n\nSo, in the midst of healing I was still alone. I yearned for friends and a group I could call my own and I found one. I met this cool chick (we\u2019ll call her Rocket) on an app and we had hit it off in the best way. She was really sweet. But knowing how online friends worked, I always thought about our friendship being on a timer. We had briefly stopped talking and she was sad that I didn\u2019t reply anymore. Well we started talking again and she offered to put me in a group chat with her friends. I accepted. Now, I knew if I was inactive, I would get kicked so I tried to make friends and ultimately succeeded. Everyone was so nice. Everyone was so affectionate and funny and we talked everyday for hours on end. When we started to Facetime we were inseparable. Me and Rocket had these checkups on each other every night. We ranted, vented, anything that was on your chests, we shared and comforted each other. I loved it. I even went to Rocket\u2019s house with one of the other girls\u2019 in the groupchat. I was the best feeling I had felt in years, being with them. I had never had friends so considerate, affectionate, caring, etc. I had always been the last option, the ear to everyone\u2019s problems (but no one would ever like to hear mine), but this time I wasn\u2019t. When I went home, back to reality, I had felt relief. But after that I had stopped engaging in the groupchat as much. It had also gotten smaller and settled on only 6 of us. For some reason, things felt weird. Me and Rocket\u2019s checkups had came to a halt. We stopped talking individually as well. Then there was a mini dispute between Rocket and another member in the group. It was resolved quickly. I had checked up on everyone fairly often and things went back to normal. For two days. Something happened again where Rocket left the groupchat after expressing her excitement for a milestone in her life, and she felt like we didn\u2019t return the same energy. After that, things went to shit and when she returned, an argument broke out (that I should\u2019ve stayed out of), and we lost two members of the group. When I had joined the altercation with intent to extinguish it, I only fueled it and ultimately left. \n\nWe all disbanded.

This has to be the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever been through. I\u2019ve been dating this guy for two years going on three years now. He\u2019s the most amazing guy I\u2019ve ever met. He pushes me to be a better person, makes me want to be the best I can be in the world, makes me laugh and has become my best friend. I\u2019m an introvert so I don\u2019t have many people I interact with so he\u2019s legit my soulmate and best friend in one. \n\nFor the past year we\u2019ve been trying to get our parents on board with allowing us to get married. We are of the same Faith but are from different countries in Africa. After some convincing, my parents have agreed but his parents are having a tougher time approving of our Union (specifically his father). He\u2019s been trying to convince his dad for the past 10 months to approve of our Union but his dad just isn\u2019t giving in. By BF has tried to get many others (uncles) to speak to his dad in hopes that they\u2019ll be able to convince him to accept our Union. From what I understand his dad wants him to marry someone from his country, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re big fans of people from my country either (his dad doesn\u2019t know me personally but the rest of his family does). \n\nThe big issue is, now that my parents are aware that his father is having trouble accepting our Union, they\u2019ve pulled back as well, saying they wouldn\u2019t want me to be in family where I\u2019m not accepted. For me personally, I\u2019m not bothered by this, I\u2019d be okay if his father doesn\u2019t love me but accepts me as long as I get to be with his son. My bf is the light of my life and I\u2019m having a very hard time of the thought of us not being together. I\u2019ve never loved anyone as much as I love him. We\u2019ve planned a whole future together. \n\nThings aren\u2019t looking too good for us though. Yesterday my bf told me that he\u2019s has one more person he would like to speak with his father to see if he can try and convince him. This person would be our last resort and if he isn\u2019t able to convince my bf\u2019s dad then chances are we may have to end everything. The meeting is supposed to happen sometime this upcoming week so by the end of this week we would know if we have to completely end things or if there is hope. \n\nI\u2019m having a really hard time accepting all of this. I\u2019ve never thought I\u2019d go through something like this. Everything is falling apart and I\u2019m not sure how or even if I can survive this. I\u2019m emotionally and spiritually attached to my bf, he is legit my everything. I speak to him 24/7 and the thought of having to never talk to him again kills me on the inside. Ever since this struggle of ours started, I have been unable to eat, sleep, I\u2019m always crying and have lost interest in everything in this world. I don\u2019t know what to do.

I also struggled with depression really severely during my 7th and 8th grade years because I didnt have a lot of friends and I isolated my self very often. I tried reading and writing to cope with my depression but nothing seemed to really help. I started to lose interest in doing daily things and fun things I used to do all the time. I still struggle with Depression and Anxiety on a day to day basis. I still get nervous when I go to the grocery store. I still get that churning feeling in my stomach when I see groups of people. I still get really sad when I think of my memories and things that had happened in the past. Its really hard to let go of those things when you know they will always be in the back of your mind. It is going to take a very long time just to get over some of the things that have to be gone through. I went to the hospital for suicide once and it wasnt a very good experience at all, I wasnt expecting it to be, but It wasnt good. They kept me in a hospital bed for a day and made me drink charcoal so they could pump my stomach. It took them a long time to make sure I was safe because I threw up the charcoal and i had to wait out the 24 hours to make sure the meds wouldnt hurt me. Then they took me to the psychiatric section of the hospital and they tried to convince me to go to a mental hospital. They called it a serious overdose and asked what made me think it was a good idea to do that. They were being very rude about it but when I went home that night, i had never been more grateful in my life and I can say that with honesty. I felt relieved when I came back to my room. I wasnt worried about how many friends I had or if my family loved me. I was just happy to be able to see the stars from my window because at that point, thats all i really needed to see. Some of my friends that I know who struggled with some of the same things didnt really talk much about what they were going through and i couldnt blame them because I didnt really talk about what was happening with me either. What caused me to take those meds I cant really say to this day but I know some of the things my friends and family were saying didnt help me at all. I just hate thinking about the fact that other people feel this way too. I dont like thinking that other people want to hurt themselves or that they dont want to live. To get out of that mental hospital, they made me come up with a safety plan. Its basically where I have to choose a person to tell if I start feeling suicidal again. But of course they may not know until I decide to do something about it. If anyone needs to talk, just let me know.

I used to be more talkative and stuff, now most of the time i would prefer to just stay quiet. Especially in school, I\u2019d rather sit alone during the breaks n shit then to have to be around people all the time. But I really do try to be social, I have made some new friends via skateboarding which is nice, but it feels like my friends i have from school are slowly drifting away. I don\u2019t have a best friend anymore, only like good friends but not a best friend. I used to have a friend group with my ex and her closest friend and 2 of my closest friends, but after me and my ex broke up they exclude me, which is understandable i guess because i was the one who broke up with her. But seeing that they are hanging out or doing something without me via social media kinda hurts. I also have also been having a hard time concentrating for school, my mind just keeps drifting. It is for the biggest part because of the break up of me and my girlfriend. I had already been contemplating my feelings for her for some time and one night when we were on facetime she asked me if I still really loved her and i didn\u2019t know what to say. What i should have said was yes but my dumbass stayed silent. We agreed to meet up the next day to talk about this. I was panicking and thought i was inclined to immediately have an answer. So i basically made a rash decision in the span of about a day to break up. It was the hardest thing i have ever done in my life. We were both bawling our eyes out in each others arms. Worst thing was that she had opened up to me earlier about being sad, well she has been to a doctor and it turns out she is severely depressed. We kept in touch via messages for 2 months after the break up, i still wanted to help her with the way she was feeling and she felt like i was the only person that really understood her so i was happy to help. But 1.5 months ago she told me she didn\u2019t need to talk to me anymore because she is now talking to a proffesional and talking to me about it is not helping anymore. I have had my doubts about if the break up was the right decision since the moment i broke up with her, these feelings are now really getting stronger after not seeing her or talking to her for so long. I wish things could just go back to way they were. I just wish she was laying in my arms again. I fucking hate this and i fucking hate myself for being so stupid. This feeling of regret, guilt and self hatred which is slowly eating me up inside. I hate feeling like this every night. I just want to hold her again and tell her how sorry i am about everything and how stupid i was. But the sad thing is, things will probably never go back to how they were. The trust is broken, i have broken her heart because of my own stupidity which has probably pushed her into a severe depression, we will probably never be able to get together again and it\u2019s all my own fault. That\u2019s the thing that hurts the most, if i would have just said yes on the facetime then maybe we would still be happy and together right now. There hasn\u2019t been a day that i have not thought about here since we broke up, but she probably thinks that i don\u2019t even think about her anymore now.", "title": "not feeling like myself anymore"}, {"created_utc": 1607824859, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/kc1yw2/my_gf_flirtet_with_my_best_friend_1_month_after/", "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "selftext": "I used to have a best friend who became such a dick L.

When we moved again, into a trailer, I started having visitations with my dad. One of those times, we met up at an Aldi's and my dad was angry with my mom. He raised his voice a lot and said something along the lines of, \"How am I supposed to know if she's my real daughter?\". I was eight when that happened and my mom had to explain to me why my dad had said that. She told me that she had slept with someone else around the same time I was conceived. Another time we had visitation, my brother didn't go to visitation and my dad told my mom, \"Why would I take her if I don't take my actual kid? I don't even know If she's mine\". My father never apologized for anything he said and till this day, he acts like those things never happened. We get along like strangers that randomly talk to each other. I never really connected with him on an emotional level until the time I tried commiting suicide, and even then, we didn't really connect on an emotional level. I found out that my dad has schizophrenia soon after and a lot of things that happened made sense. I can't tell if he's a lost father or not.

One became this psychedelics user and painter hosting parties in his coutryside home, the other got kicked out of his mom's house and by being homeless became a sort of charismatic adventurous black metal artist, a Valfar or Per Ohlin copypasta, and him and other of these \"creeps\" created a metal band as a pretext to hang out.\nI had not seen the potential of these people by being a piece of sht unable to see people as they really are, and at how high in charisma and social success could be at their best. I quit just the moment it became to be wild back there. Too bad. I didnt write, just watched youtube, didnt even play games which could at least have uppered my cultural and social credits.\nThen I got in a wood carving schools, running away.

But either by being stuck in the failed social context because fearing to losing the pearls in the garbage that are in it and that would lose contact with me and that I would have to start over in a new context OR when running away from this context by sacrificing the pearls, I still cant begin to be creative. \nYet I have all the ideas in my head but \u20acprocrastination\u20ac.\n Oh and if I leave I will be at my parents and its very humiliating because i cannot fully live and work on my projects by being into the fking nest of mommy, having my room asked getting cleaned and all the stuff, not being able to invite whoever i want or order the food or -healthy unaddictive-psychedelics I want, not having my private world. I'm stuck.\n Do I risk remaking the same mistake as in my 16nth year? \nDo I try getting an apartment and a shitjob to struggle away from the nest as a free grown man, to carve wood and write things and all?\n Or do I stay in this humiliating context to not lose all the social interactions I have with the awesome friends I have in this upholstery course?\n Or do I wait till covid ends to do this?\n Some friends in this highschool are metalheads and i love metal and would love to play the guitar with them but i cant play the guitar even though i personally own one, and leaving rn would repeat the pattern of when i quit my first school and see my friends forget me to work on music projects.\n Do I stay till the end of the course the time to learn some guitar, some chords, and integrate better with them and be later on in my life more easily in touch with the metal world? I don't have a fucking clue.\n I feel like an artist, always felt, and i dont wanna stagnate in this hole but not lose friends either. \nAm I fucked?\n I'm stuck with procrastination and asociality since middle school.\nP.S i'm diagnosed with aspergers\nP.P.S i decided to go in Berlin for my upholstery stage out of craving for travel but everything is closed, all my teachers think im a very very important student and the expect me to be as passionnate in this course as it takes to want to be the first to make this stage up there in our deutsche neighbourss home.

Sad makes ME want to talk. And be validated and reassured and comforted. Sometimes that is not the scenario when there is no one to talk to and no one who really can tell you what you crave to hear: what to do and what will happen and when I will feel happy. What do you do then?\n\nWell you listen to Warren Zevon singing Lawyers, Guns and Money repeatedly to be in the mood you feel. That song feels like an adventure of fucked up chaos. That\u2019s where my mind wants me to be.

Lamenting that you never finish anything you start and this will be another. \n\nThe lyrics  \u2018when I feel the world is too much for me, I look up to the big sky and see\u2019 come on. What depressing song is this? Oh it\u2019s Big Sky by the Kinks. Perfect. Continue on don\u2019t give a shit about anything playlist. My engagement with my sadness grows and I think that embracing things is what therapists usually say, which makes me feel less guilty about this \u2018coping mechanism.\u2019 Except my counselor may not agree, and wrote me a prescription today after a brain-spotting session that directs me to daily yoga and regular tapping exercises, and a picture of an snowman. \nThe fact that it\u2019s on a Dunder Mifflin label means this guy ain\u2019t fucking around. He does understand my sense of humor however. Which is also a coping mechanism.\n\nMaybe everything is a coping mechanism.\nWe have to cope with sadness, and loss, and failure, and heartbreak, and as humans our brains must accept that and cope in a healthy way. I am finding through my counselors that this is a \u201cmalfunction area.\u201d More than likely from past trauma that I did not realize was trauma, because when the words \u2018past trauma\u2019 come up I feel the assumption is, \u201cYep that chic got raped by her uncle for sure.\u201d \n\nMy trauma is not the same or as dramatic. But that and a series of wrong, right, and and misguided choices of mine has led me to the BIG SAD. BIGGEST SAD. If only my limbic and paralimbic brain systems worked as the manufacturer made, but perhaps that would be worse when I think about it. \n\nThe BIG sad makes it hard to do anything but half of everything. If you were an optimist I guess you would see that as the glass half full. I see it as grandiose delusion of decisiveness and the ability to follow through. (That may be the dictionary definition of pessimism but don\u2019t quote me on that).\n\nAnd just like that, the BIG SAD comes and exhausts my ability to write any longer. Now that Biden is president, maybe we can get a lobby group together to tackle the BIG SAD.

I see all these low quality workers (people who have poor work ethic, work as slowly as they can, don\u2019t know how to do a lot of things even though they\u2019ve been there for decades, etc..) and how they milk the system by being in a higher position just because of luck (and it truly was since they didn\u2019t have the same management team that I walked into). It\u2019s been difficult and damn near impossible to not have resentment for this place and all the shit I go through on a daily basis and never be recognized for anything. I just get taken advantage of. Yes the easy answer is find another job but my job is specialized that it\u2019s not that easy to find something else (though I\u2019m working on it).\n\nI just hate everyone, I hate God (if there is one), and I really don\u2019t understand why I am here.

I'm no stranger to hardship. But as of late i can barely validate my own existence with each coming day.\n\nA year ago my father had a stroke. An ambulance failed to diagnose it, saying that it's \"just a hypertonic crisis\". Next few days i spent walking him through a bureaucratic mess of state healthcare to diagnose and hospitalise him while his condition deteriorated. When they finally decided to put him into hospital for 10 days he probably had another stroke by the looks of it, which they didn't diagnose at all. \nAfter his time there they've scheduled him for a surgery to remove the clot causing the strokes, but the hospital wing to which they directed him refused to accept him because it lacked accomodations for people who couldn't service themselves. Just like that they threw half blind man unable to walk - out. After some talking i have arranged for surgery to be carried out in neurosurgery wing, but they could only do it in 6 months.\n\nFor six whole months i, having basically no income, watched over him. Changed his diapers. Fed him food. Washed his body.  Watched him slowly go insane as he didn't even let me sleep because he hallucinated our house being on fire. I even had to ask my elderly mum to come over and help me, even though she divorced him a long time ago.\n\nTo make things clear - he was a total dickhead, for whom i have no sympathy at all. He made my mother's life miserable, turning her hair gray at 26, he put his own daughter through something no girl should ever go through, and most importantly - he did it to himself, smoking two packs per day and eating like a boar, he had this stroke coming. But in this time i saw such suffering that it made me pity him.\n\nHe died, and i buried him. But to this day those six months haunt me in my sleeping and waking hours. Perhaps I'm being too light on myself, but i think carrying paralyzed 120 kg boar at the age of 22 broke my spine, mental, if not physical.\n\nI have worked for some time after that. It was an entry level job at tech support. It was exhausting and humiliating, but i treated every day as an opportunity to learn something new, and eventually i got pretty good, even going into talks about promotion.\n\nA sad irony of tech support is that normal people don't call there over nothing, or if they have problems - they figure it out on their own most of the time. So if they call you - it's probably some dim wit who wants to be angry for the sake of being angry. And you have to talk to them in the dry corporate language mgmt forces onto you every time.\n\nEventually that, and the constant stress from recurring nightmares and memories in general that just found the way in my head every time forced me to quit, even among the pandemics.\nWith some money and some odd jobs i continued to make ends meet, and support my elderly mum, who receives a generous donation from our glorious government in a form of $120 pension monthly.\n\nThings don't look good. I tried to learn something new, get some new skills to find a better employment or at least do more substantial jobs, but it all slips away. I just can't concentrate on anything. I don't even procrastinate, i just sit there, paralyzed, staring somewhere, trying to think about how to make things better and immediately stopping because it hurts so much realising that you have nowhere to go. Whole days pass in a blink of an eye. I'm afraid to sleep because every time i dream it's only about how things got even worse. Worst of all, sometimes he comes back and i have to watch him in my sleep again. Even when i realize that it's a dream, i yell and cry but i can't wake up. I can't rest, I'm always sleepy and dizzy, but sleeping is so much worse. Things that brought joy once - art, videogames, sex - are all now meaningless and dull to the point i don't even consider them anymore. Hell, i even have troubles getting an erection when it's a particularly bad day.\n\nBut to this point i hoped it will all go away. I brushed it off as temporary inconvenience, preferring to spend time with my SO and hope for a better tomorrow. And recently my sis asked me for help. She and mum have bought a three room apartment some time ago, but while sis renovates it mum lives at my place.\nI come here to find out that she has basically on month worth of spendings money left and that renovations are 1/3 finished at best. She had no job for past 20 years, living off her husband's and later ex-husbands money, has no experience in construction work whatsoever (neither do i), and she basically botched it wasting all the money she dedicated to it. I hate construction work. It's psychologically hard for me. But now i will have to pick up this and finish it up as best as i can. I don't have basically any tools, any skills, but i have to do something because the alternative is nothing.\n\nAnd i just don't know. I sit here and write this because I can't even get up to look at this shit. I have no idea where to even begin, not only with this work, but with my life in general. People have dreams, targets to which they can plot courses, no matter how metaphorical and unreachable. And I can't even dream anymore. I don't see where and how to plot my way.

I just know the breakup is the straw that broke the camels back.\n\nIn March when the pandemic started, I was sent home from college. It was my senior year so I was very upset I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to all my friends and graduated on zoom. Also, I had 0 job prospects. I had planned to move to a big city about 2 hours away and work. That was all taken away.\n\nI was super sad and lonely March-May. But at least I had my boyfriend. \n\nAt the end of May, I got an awesome job opportunity. I worked as a brand ambassador all summer for a big company (won\u2019t reveal the name, want to remain anonymous on here). While this job was happening, my boyfriend and I broke up. I won\u2019t go into details but he abused alcohol, and every time he did he abused me emotionally. We were broken up for about a month without contact really, and then I reached out because I missed him. He spent the next 3 months trying to prove he had changed. I was scared. Scared to make another mistake. But also, I was very distracted with my job. I was having so much fun and I was happy. I didn\u2019t give myself time to think much about the breakup. \n\nFast forward to September, my job ends. It was only a summer job. Me and my ex are still hanging out. And when I say hanging out, I mean we\u2019re dating, we just hadn\u2019t declared that. We spent so much time together, with each other\u2019s families, it was like nothing had changed. With my job done, I got to thinking more about our breakup. I thought you know what, he really had changed. He hadn\u2019t been drinking and he\u2019d been so much nicer/respectful towards me. So I told him I was ready to officially get back together. I wasn\u2019t nervous about this at all since I was under the impression it wouldn\u2019t be that hard to do. He had said he wanted to all this time we were still spending time together, and I felt like he had changed. Since why we broke up in the first place was his issues. Well, my mistake. He ended up turning cold on me and left me in the dust. I won\u2019t get into the sad boring details, but he strung me along for a month just saying he \u201cbuilt up walls\u201d but \u201cstill loved me and we could fix things\u201d. I\u2019ll spare the details again but I found out he was with another girl and when I did, he blocked me on everything. Side note: we were together for 3 years. This happened 2 months ago.\n\nBut anyways, yes that whole situation has sent me down a dark dark hole. And to make matters worse, I do not have a job. That reason being, I start the summer job again in April. I had tried to apply to places a month ago but no one wants to hire me when I will be leaving for the summer. \n\nI also am back home with my mom. I have been since March when I was sent home from college. I live in a very small town. I\u2019m talking one stoplight. There\u2019s nothing to do. Also, my ex lives here. \n\nI just feel so stuck right now. I find myself counting down the days until the summer. Thinking \u201cI can finally move on then. I\u2019ll be happy then. I\u2019ll be busy, I\u2019ll be around people, and I will be over him.\u201d There\u2019s nothing to do all day and I do try to do things. I walk my dog around, I help my mom cook, I try my best to keep myself busy but it\u2019s so hard here. I\u2019m so heartbroken and I feel like I can\u2019t recover from it because I feel so stuck. I feel like I\u2019m falling into a depression, or I\u2019m already there. I cry every day about my ex and what happened. But I also cry because I feel like I can\u2019t do anything to help make it better.

I\u2019ve had sex with a number of woman in my 20\u2019s and it wasn\u2019t until after a year of dating that I told her I had sex before and it floored her. We were road tripping to meet her friends and she was completely withdrawn the whole day after I told her. When we drove back, she started asking questions about details and I panicked and thought she would leave me if I told the truth so lied about how long ago all this happened (5 years compared to 1 year before dating). I know this was wrong and selfish but I just panicked. Fast forward to early December, we were engaged for 2 months and the lie always weighed on me so I told her the truth that I wasn\u2019t honest about the timeline and she ended things.

Nobody ever makes an effort to reach out even though I will always be asking people that we should talk and catch up. Most \"friends\" just want to talk about themselves and will never be bothered to even ask about my day.

I've never treated anyone wrong. I spend like $100/month on groceries, I eat healthy, I try to take care of myself. I'm careful with money while people go out and will blindly spend hundreds without a second thought. Meanwhile I think several times before even spending $5. I won't even drive anywhere if it's further than 10 miles because I don't want to spend a lot on gas.\n\nWhy the fuck is it that the horrible people I encounter are living better lives than me? So many people I know that are selfish, greedy, and rude. But they're a whole different person on social media. And life seems to also give them almost everything they desire. Privilege is a real bitch.\n\nIt's a daily struggle to wake up and try to feel something other than empty.

I have extreme difficulty getting close to people. For the most part, at best I\u2019m completely apathetic towards people I meet, couldn\u2019t give a shit if they lived or died, and at worst I absolutely fucking hate them. I don\u2019t know why but it just feels like whatever part of people that makes them care about others and want to get invested in their lives is almost completely missing in me. I don\u2019t even give a shit about my family. To be fair I don\u2019t speak to my dad and I think if someone told me he was dead I\u2019d probably laugh, and my mum and my sister put me through some pretty rough shit as a kid too. But still, I genuinely don\u2019t think I\u2019d care at all if any of them died tomorrow. It\u2019s like I said, I feel like I\u2019m missing a piece.\n\nBut there was this one girl who I used to work with and at first I thought she hated me. But eventually we got to Woking and she started to warm up to me. Pretty quickly we got really close, she started coming to talk to me on her breaks, started texting me heaps, asking to hang out outside of work and all that stuff. One night I had a fight with my mum and I got super drunk, cut myself up and tried to kill myself by taking a whole box of Temazepam. Got put in hospital and this girl found out from someone else and came to visit me in there. I\u2019d opened up a bit about my issues before but she really saw how much of a mess I am that day. After that she told me she thought I should stay with her in the spare room at her mums place for a while and I did. Eventually I felt like I was imposing and I went. Back home, but that couple days was maybe the happiest I\u2019ve ever been. After that she sent me drunk texts about how I was the funniest, coolest, most loyal person she\u2019d ever met and I deserved to know that.\n\nShe helped me look for a place of my own and insisted that I wasn\u2019t allowed to pay for movers because she was gonna help me move it instead. She even bought me goldfish cause she knew I was gonna be living alone and I think she wanted me to be responsible for something in case I thought about killing myself again. She was the first person to show me unconditional love and care and as a result, I fell completely in love with her. I knew she didn\u2019t feel the same way and it started to kill me inside. I wanted to be around her all the time but it also hurt so much. I vowed I\u2019d never tell her because I didn\u2019t want to put her in such an uncomfortable position but one night I guess my emotions boiled over and I got really drunk while on a bunch of medications and texted her how I felt. I blacked out that night and had to be taken to hospital but a couple days later she texted me back saying she was livid that I\u2019d done that to myself again (I\u2019d said I was gonna stop drinking) and also that she didn\u2019t love me like that. \n\nI quit that job not long after and circumstance forced me to move away at the start of last year. She still texts me outta the blue very occasionally but we barely talk now. It\u2019s been two months since we spoke and about a year and a half since we\u2019ve seen each other in person. I was back in town for a weekend and asked if she wanted to hang out but she didn\u2019t get back to me and when I asked why not, she said she forgot about it until it was too late and felt too guilty to respond. That was the last time we spoke, actually. Since then I\u2019ve actually moved back in with my mum, in the same town I used to live in but I\u2019m not gonna tell her I\u2019m back, don\u2019t want her to think it\u2019s because of her or that I\u2019m being creepy or something, plus I think it\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t want to see me as much as I want to see her, which I get.\n\nBut I still think about her every day, I never stopped. She\u2019s always in my head, I find myself giving myself therapy-like talk with an imaginary version of her all the time and have to force myself to stop thinking about her. I get excited when I see that she\u2019s watched my Insta story or something. It feels gross and obsessive, I\u2019m still so hung up after all this time. I hate it. I still love her who completely, whit ever single fibre of my being. I love her so much it fucking hurts, it hurts so fucking much. It makes no fucking sense at all but I love her so much I\u2019m angry at her. And I\u2019m angry at me, for being angry at her because I know she doesn\u2019t deserve it and I feel so guilty about it, I\u2019m angry at myself for letting myself fall this deeply in love with someone in the first place. It hurts that\u2019s we\u2019ve grown so distant and that it probably won\u2019t and honestly shouldn\u2019t change. It just hurts to love someone this much, it feels like my heart is filled with broken glass that stabs into me with every beat.\n\nI want to be lobotomised, I want my emotions completely taken away, I don\u2019t want to feel anything anymore. What am I supposed to do when even the good emotions leave me completely fucking destroyed? Everything good turns into pain eventually and I don\u2019t want to feel anything anymore.

I have extreme difficulty getting close to people. For the most part, at best I\u2019m completely apathetic towards people I meet, couldn\u2019t give a shit if they lived or died, and at worst I absolutely fucking hate them. I don\u2019t know why but it just feels like whatever part of people that makes them care about others and want to get invested in their lives is almost completely missing in me. I don\u2019t even give a shit about my family. To be fair I don\u2019t speak to my dad and I think if someone told me he was dead I\u2019d probably laugh, and my mum and my sister put me through some pretty rough shit as a kid too. But still, I genuinely don\u2019t think I\u2019d care at all if any of them died tomorrow. It\u2019s like I said, I feel like I\u2019m missing a piece.\n\nBut there was this one girl who I used to work with and at first I thought she hated me. But eventually we got to Woking and she started to warm up to me. Pretty quickly we got really close, she started coming to talk to me on her breaks, started texting me heaps, asking to hang out outside of work and all that stuff. One night I had a fight with my mum and I got super drunk, cut myself up and tried to kill myself by taking a whole box of Temazepam. Got put in hospital and this girl found out from someone else and came to visit me in there. I\u2019d opened up a bit about my issues before but she really saw how much of a mess I am that day. After that she told me she thought I should stay with her in the spare room at her mums place for a while and I did. Eventually I felt like I was imposing and I went. Back home, but that couple days was maybe the happiest I\u2019ve ever been. After that she sent me drunk texts about how I was the funniest, coolest, most loyal person she\u2019d ever met and I deserved to know that.\n\nShe helped me look for a place of my own and insisted that I wasn\u2019t allowed to pay for movers because she was gonna help me move it instead. She even bought me goldfish cause she knew I was gonna be living alone and I think she wanted me to be responsible for something in case I thought about killing myself again. She was the first person to show me unconditional love and care and as a result, I fell completely in love with her. I knew she didn\u2019t feel the same way and it started to kill me inside. I wanted to be around her all the time but it also hurt so much. I vowed I\u2019d never tell her because I didn\u2019t want to put her in such an uncomfortable position but one night I guess my emotions boiled over and I got really drunk while on a bunch of medications and texted her how I felt. I blacked out that night and had to be taken to hospital but a couple days later she texted me back saying she was livid that I\u2019d done that to myself again (I\u2019d said I was gonna stop drinking) and also that she didn\u2019t love me like that. \n\nI quit that job not long after and circumstance forced me to move away at the start of last year. She still texts me outta the blue very occasionally but we barely talk now. It\u2019s been two months since we spoke and about a year and a half since we\u2019ve seen each other in person. I was back in town for a weekend and asked if she wanted to hang out but she didn\u2019t get back to me and when I asked why not, she said she forgot about it until it was too late and felt too guilty to respond. That was the last time we spoke, actually. Since then I\u2019ve actually moved back in with my mum, in the same town I used to live in but I\u2019m not gonna tell her I\u2019m back, don\u2019t want her to think it\u2019s because of her or that I\u2019m being creepy or something, plus I think it\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t want to see me as much as I want to see her, which I get.\n\nBut I still think about her every day, I never stopped. She\u2019s always in my head, I find myself giving myself therapy-like talk with an imaginary version of her all the time and have to force myself to stop thinking about her. I get excited when I see that she\u2019s watched my Insta story or something. It feels gross and obsessive, I\u2019m still so hung up after all this time. I hate it. I still love her who completely, whit ever single fibre of my being. I love her so much it fucking hurts, it hurts so fucking much. It makes no fucking sense at all but I love her so much I\u2019m angry at her. And I\u2019m angry at me, for being angry at her because I know she doesn\u2019t deserve it and I feel so guilty about it, I\u2019m angry at myself for letting myself fall this deeply in love with someone in the first place. It hurts that\u2019s we\u2019ve grown so distant and that it probably won\u2019t and honestly shouldn\u2019t change. It just hurts to love someone this much, it feels like my heart is filled with broken glass that stabs into me with every beat.\n\nI want to be lobotomised, I want my emotions completely taken away, I don\u2019t want to feel anything anymore.

Every woman I\u2019ve ever loved has cheated on me. It\u2019s a betrayal that never truly heals. There were a few girlfriends early on who cheated but I just felt it was a path I needed to take to find a woman who truly loved me. I thought my marriage will be different. We had a child and I was a great stepfather. It was the first time I gave all of myself to someone. When I returned from my deployment, I found out she had spent my entire absence with another man. \n\nMy next engagement came seven years later to a woman I had my next child with. Within a year she left me and destroyed our family for a felon fresh out of prison. I don\u2019t judge peoples life choices. But when you compare, it makes you ask am \u201cI really that bad?\u201d I swore I was done but I\u2019m met a woman who changed my life. I fell in love straight away and we both thought we had found our soulmates. I loved her more than any before. She broke up with me six months later. It was my fault I guess. But the pain of finding out she was sleeping with her ex during her \u201cgym trips\u201d cut deeper than ever before. \n\nSo now I\u2019m alone. Obviously the pain and trauma of my past still looms over my head. But I found that in the moments where I want to get back on the horse and keep tryin, Or wait for the \u201cright girl\u201d to come along, I just can\u2019t bring myself to do it. The thought of rejection or being hurt it\u2019s just not worth it. Being lonely is dark. You don\u2019t just want sex necessarily. You want someone to hold you like they never wanna let you go. You\u2019ll never find that in a one night stand. That look someone gives you like you\u2019re the most amazing thing they\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nI\u2019ve reached out to old flames and every no pushes the knife deeper into my soul. I\u2019ve even offered dinner or just casual conversation. I can almost hear the excuse before it comes out of their mouth or across the screen. I can\u2019t even pleasure myself. I feel pathetic. I watched an entire adult film without getting an erection. I feel broken. \n\nMy point is I believe that this pain of being alone. Yearning to be touched and loved by someone who cares. Is terrible. But it doesn\u2019t compare to the devastation rejection brings. The hurt of betrayal. The feeling of being too fat, ugly or unsatisfactory in bed. Everyone says \u201cYou just gotta find the right girl!\u201d Or \u201cYou gotta love yourself first!\u201d  Convincing myself I don\u2019t need water when I\u2019m dying of thirst doesn\u2019t make me any less parched. And how many more rejections, betrayals and lies can I take. This last one felt like death. \n\nI can love myself to the moon and back but the constant reminder that I\u2019m the only one who does love me is no less difficult.

I don't know how I can help her I exhaust every part of myself to help but I don't know how I can help with something so difficult as a stroke. I also love her family too I'd be so upset to lose her father I don't know how I can help her although I'm sure she knows he might be here for so much longer although I hope he can be. My dad never talks to me and lives on the other side of the country and we talk so infrequently that we may as well not talk at all I do care about him but I can't talk to him because its just awkward now. My stepdad is a recovering alcoholic too and he seems to think I'm the bane of his world or so it feels like. I'll admit I'm not perfect I have ADHD and forget to do normal things like brushing teeth or cleaning up after myself although I do try and since he's lost his license he spends all day at home and ends up cleaning after me then just being annoyed at me. Yesterday he flipped out again (he previously got drunk and attempted to attack my mum but I stopped him by forcing the door shut and keeping us in a room. This happened because he takes anti depression tablets and drank but now he's off alcohol or so I'm led to believe) and threw stuff around the kitchen and claimed to have set fire to my drums which I spent \u00a3240 on but haven't had the chance to get lessons for because of covid and now were moving to a smaller more urban house and idk what to do with them but I want to keep them to get something for my investment.

They then interrogated me for an entire 5-7 hours demanding me to give them a timeline of my relationship eg when our first kiss was, when we hooked up etc. It was horrible. I never said a word because they screamed back at me and told me to stfu and listen as if I committed a murder/crime.

There\u2019s an empty void within my chest. Like something was just ripped from my chest. I can\u2019t remember what it was. My head is foggy as I step within the world. I wonder what could be the cause of my hazy body. If I pinched myself I\u2019d be stuck in this nightmare. I remember this feeling. It\u2019s not my first time in this place. I prayed I'd never have to be back here and here I am. I continue to do my routine of the day like a zombie. I think to myself \u201cWill she come back? Is she really gone forever?\u201d. I can\u2019t focus because i just keep thinking back to that same void. Like something important is missing. The night before I cried my eyes out into my bed, screaming at nothing but trying to rid the pain of the heartbreak. What could possibly help me with this tragedy? It isn\u2019t the literal end of the world but it feels like I can\u2019t keep going on with this life anymore. Nothing holds value to me anymore as much as she did. But what can I do to help myself if everything I\u2019ve loved and held dear to me is gone? There is no way for me to move on on such short notice. People talk to me and I try to fake a smile here and there and laugh a little but deep in me I know it\u2019s not truly how I feel. I think about all the memories we had, the good ones, the bad ones, the pictures of her, the texts, and everything about her. Her. She was the one thing that kept me glued to this earth and happier amongst the bad things in life. We had goals and a life we wanted to live together. As one. Then it all shattered overnight like glass. Why can\u2019t I just have permanent happiness? I\u2019m sick of these temporary feelings. Have I really earned all this bad karma to feel like a useless piece of emotional garbage? As I finish up my day of being fake to the people around me I can feel myself crumbling. The tears welled up in my eyes as I walked to my car. I sit down in my car to breath. I can feel myself about to hyperventilate as those precious drops of water and salt roll down my cheeks. I can\u2019t decipher in my head why I\u2019m crying but I know I\u2019m sad. More than sad in fact I\u2019m broken. I calm myself down a little bit and begin the drive to my home. I don\u2019t dare turn on music in fear it\u2019ll remind me of her. I get out my car and walk to my door to unlock it just to fall on my bed as soon as i get inside. I curl up into my blanket not caring about eating. How could I eat with so much on my mind? To me there's no point in trying to stay awake any longer. So I grab the Ambien beside my bed and pop 6. They are 15mg each. The lethal dose is 70mg and I just took 90mg like candy. I\u2019m supposed to only take 2 but I could care less about what my future holds. I lay on my back staring at my ceiling fan going round and round waiting for the rest to come. Tears come again as I think of what I just did and what might happen. I start to wonder if anyone will miss me. Will she notice I\u2019m gone for good? Will my parents find out? How do people know I\u2019m not here anymore?

I found out the day after my 21st birthday that I have been given the blessing of being pregnant. It wasn\u2019t planned, but also not a bad thing. Which I\u2019ll get into later on in the post. \n\nMy mother died July 9th of this year in her sleep at my (26; eldest) sister and her girlfriends house. They have been taking care of my dad who has been fighting AML for some time now. My mom was in the ICU this time for liver failure because of her drinking habits, but they saved her. The doctors explained that she could never have a drink again and that she needed to change her ways or she wouldn\u2019t live for much longer. While she was in the hospital unresponsive, my siblings and I decided to move her possessions into a storage unit and take her necessities to my grandmothers house where she would be staying since she was scheduled to be evicted. My (16) brother who was the last of the 6 of us who lived with her went into the care of my aunt and uncle as they could support him the greatest and ensure that he would finish school. \nWhen she got out of the hospital she called me and I didn\u2019t answer. She left me a voicemail thanking me for taking care of my brother and going to see my dad every day as he had been in the hospital dealing with his cancer. I saved the voicemail and I listen to it often. \n\nMy mother went to live with her mother and my dad went to live with my sister. \nMy dad went into remission but with AML it\u2019s not about IF the cancer comes back, it\u2019s when. His siblings and his son were tested to see for a match for a stem cell transplant and by the Grace of god my brother is a match. My mother was aware that he was in remission. \n\nOne evening after my mother and grandmother got into an argument, my mother told my grandmother that my dads cancer was back in his brain and that she needed to be with her husband. She went to my sisters house and she died peacefully in her sleep in his bed. \n\nMy grandmother knew my mom had been drinking as she found minis under the couch and told us, but we couldn\u2019t afford rehab let alone convince her to go. The only chance we had was when she was in ICU and my (22) sister was her hippa or power of attorney or whatever they call it. My mom chose her because she knew I would have forced her to go. She chose the sibling who was the most gentle. \n\nMy dad was in remission. My mom lied to my grandmother. I suspect she knew what she was doing. \n\nMy dad is scheduled now for the transplant but his body is weak from the chemo treatments which he will have to continue after the transplant. He was given three options, two of which would certainly kill him, so he went with option 3 which is really a test. Something that has only been used for some 36 cases. Of those 36 cases, 6 died and 6 got the cancer again. \n\nI talk to him and see him as often as I can. Take photos. He buys me little things like a stuffie here and there. We cook and we eat. We laugh and we talk about his grand baby, my baby. \n\nI announced my pregnancy on July 4th. My parents were overjoyed and so proud for me to finally have a baby with my boyfriend of 5 years. \n\nThis was the last time I saw my mom. The last thing she said to me was that I would make an amazing mother and that she was so proud of me. She hugged me hard. \n\nLosing her when I needed her the most has been hard. I always imagined when I had a child she would be there in the room holding my hand, finger combing my hair, speaking words of love to me. \n\nMy dad took it very hard. I went to get him while the police were there bringing the investigation on her death. He asked me if I wanted to see her and I said no. I didn\u2019t want the last glimpse I had of her to be her dead body, but I should have. I should have held her hand once more and touched her head. \n\nShe visits me in my dreams almost every night.\n\nI can\u2019t lose both of my parents in one year. Not while I\u2019m pregnant, not when I need them so badly. \n\nAs I said before this pregnancy was not at all planed, but absolutely not a bad thing. My boyfriends parents are overjoyed to finally have a grandchild. My siblings are so very excited and supportive. My boyfriend has been nothing but amazing to me and I\u2019m grateful to have made a human with the person I love so dearly. This is genuinely a child who was made from love. \n\nIt\u2019s a girl.

I would end up crying most every day in those 2 years. I lost not only my wife, but my best friend, my driving around partner, my biggest fan. The more I think about it, I lost my entire life. You said it was because I was an emotional rollercoaster. I know with my having mental illness it wasn't always easy. However you thought instead of mental health issues it was drug use. I won't deny that I self medicated at times. However I had nothing else. You didn't like how the medication reacted on me. Over time you began to be vengeful. You engaged in multiple affairs over the 16 years we were together. What you did not realize is that I knew every time. Not just the first 2. There were many signs, but none was worse than the emptiness I had at home. I tried to talk yet the TV war more important. If it wasn't the TV, it was the phone. You spent more time with those two electronics than with me, or the kids. We missed you. I was alone even when I sat next to you on the couch. I began to cycle more often emotionally, and it began to get more severe. Since you didn't want to believe in the mental health problems I just found it easier to say \"yes you're right it's drugs\" I wanted more than anything to attend some sort of counseling with you like you offered. However you were too busy with the person you were giving your conversation and attention to. I know the divorce was hard for you. I know it hurt you pretty bad when we separated, but you still never gave me the chance to get my medications right. You made a promise to me and our 2 kids. You said to us... We could try working things out and get some counseling. That you couldn't stay mad at me forever. I apologize that I dropped into 2 episodes of psychosis. I hoped you would never witness that. I knew you would not be able to understand. I knew at that point I would be damaged. Almost like a leper I would not be good enough for you anymore. I was right. You separated yourself no longer talking to me. You denied the affairs until a later date when you needed to hurt me. I just wanted you to know, and hopefully maybe you will read this. I have forgiven the affairs I suffered my triggers because of those and how you ignored me. I laid awake many nights your back to me. I cried as I placed my hand on your bottom.

The farthest I've gone with a girl was making out with this one girl back in 2016 only because of a dare. She actually didn't even wanna kiss me she liked someone else at the time. I realize I'm still young and I have plenty of time to find someone and chances are I will. In fact I'm actually transferring out of my community college and into a new university this upcoming semester so that will not only give me  much more chances to meet girls but also make new friends. But sometimes I get into these anxious thought loops about how I will die young and alone. I know it's not rational to think that way but I can't help it when my brain fires on all cylinders.\n\nAnyway if somehow I get to my late 20's and I still have never empierced what it's like to have a girlfriend I'd personally rather just end my loneliness and see whatever the next life has to offer. That's just how I feel personally I don't want to enter my 30s still being alone. Whenever I see posts about \"I'm 30 years old and still a virgin\" all I can think of is \"I would have killed myself by now\" Chances are when you get into your 30s and never had a girlfriend then you'll never get one for the rest of your life. So ultimately instead of spending whatever years I have left after 30 wallowing in my own loneliness I'd rather just end it on my own terms. But I still have a lot of time since then so I am staying hopeful and I keep telling myself \"I will find someone.\" Also on an unrelated note I'm an only child and that gets pretty fucking lonely sometimes.\n\nOne thing I feel like I need to clarify when I post about this is that I'm average height and while I'm on the skinny side it's noting too crazy.

I\u2019m not good with words or speaking to people so I decided to buy her something that she\u2019s wanted for a long time. It\u2019s a bit expensive but I\u2019ve got the money. I can afford it.

It ended up getting some sexual footage of me masturbating. So I quickly unfriended them. Upon unfriending them, another Facebook account said something about sharing that video to my family, friends, and my college and ruining my life forever because of it. I was so scared for my life and I had to temporarily deactivate my Facebook account because of it. And the same thing with my entire family. I was so traumatized, that I felt like this situation would permanently affect how I act around women forever. And as you'll soon see, it did. Now here's the story.\n\nThe other day, I posted on [r/virgin](https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/) how I have mixed feelings about being a 21-year old virgin. And that for one thing, I love the freedom that comes with being single from being in more control of my life and what I do with my money, to not having to worry about another responsibility in my life given that I have a lot on me already. On the other hand, I don't like the pressure of having to go out and lose my virginity at least once by some age that varies depending on whom you ask. This post is so recent that you can look at my Reddit history and find it right there if you're interested in looking at it.\n\nSometime after posting it, someone tried DMing me. This person whom I will not reveal was active on virgin subreddits. What she said in her opening message was this: \"Hey :) I'm \\[REDACTED\\]. I'm \\[Close to my age\\]. I saw your post and hence my message. Check out my posts if you want to know a bit about me too. And send a pic if you want?\" Given my traumatic story I mentioned earlier, I told her to send a selfie with her holding 3 fingers up with her tongue sticking out. She said she will do it via Kik, but I requested Imgur given that I got rid of it a long time ago. She said she would prefer not to do it through Imgur.\n\nHere's where I feel like I stepped my bounds. I told her that I don't know if I could talk to people online given that traumatic experience I had, especially those who text me first. And based on what I've read from her posts if she's looking for someone to meet and possibly hook up with, I'm not what she's looking for. She responded by saying \"I'm looking to chat.\" I told her that I still was not in the mood to do that and that she should look elsewhere if she wants to chat.\n\nI feel like I let my trauma get the best of me and I hurt her so badly. She just wanted to talk with me in a friendly way but because she was a woman who approached me first, I ran away from her because I perceived her as a threat. A threat that could blackmail me and ruin my life forever. And that wasn't the case.\n\nSorry for the long post, but thanks for reading it if you got this far.\n\n**TL;DR** Got blackmailed by a FB bot and almost fell victim to sexploitation. I posted on [r/virgin](https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/) about my mixed feelings about being a virgin.

It ended up getting some sexual footage of me masturbating. So I quickly unfriended them. Upon unfriending them, another Facebook account said something about sharing that video to my family, friends, and my college and ruining my life forever because of it. I was so scared for my life and I had to temporarily deactivate my Facebook account because of it. And the same thing with my entire family. I was so traumatized, that I felt like this situation would permanently affect how I act around women forever. And as you'll soon see, it did. Now here's the story.\n\nThe other day, I posted on [r/virgin](https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/) how I have mixed feelings about being a 21-year old virgin. And that for one thing, I love the freedom that comes with being single from being in more control of my life and what I do with my money, to not having to worry about another responsibility in my life given that I have a lot on me already. On the other hand, I don't like the pressure of having to go out and lose my virginity at least once by some age that varies depending on who you ask. This post is so recent that you can look at my Reddit history and find it right there if you're interested in looking at it.\n\nSometime after posting it, someone tried DMing me. This person who I will not reveal was active on virgin subreddits. What she said in her opening message was this: \"Hey :) I'm \\[REDACTED\\]. I'm \\[Close to my age\\]. I saw your post and hence my message. Check out my posts if you want to know a bit about me too. And send a pic if you want?\" Given my traumatic story I mentioned earlier, I told her to send a selfie with her holding 3 fingers up with her tongue sticking out. She said she will do it via Kik, but I requested Imgur given that I got rid of it a long time ago. She said she would prefer not to do it through Imgur.\n\nHere's where I feel like I stepped my bounds. I told her that I don't know if I could talk to people online given that traumatic experience I had, especially those who text me first. And based on what I've read from her posts if she's looking for someone to meet and possibly hook up with, I'm not what she's looking for. She responded by saying \"I'm looking to chat.\" I told her that I still was not in the mood to do that and that she should look elsewhere if she wants to chat.\n\nI feel like I let my trauma get the best of me and I hurt her so badly. She just wanted to talk with me in a friendly way but because she was a woman who approached me first, I ran away from her because I perceived her as a threat. A threat that could blackmail me and ruin my life forever. And that wasn't the case.\n\nSorry for the long post, but thanks for reading it if you got this far.\n\n**TL;DR** Got blackmailed by a FB bot and almost fell victim to sexploitation. I posted on [r/virgin](https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/) about my mixed feelings about being a virgin.

We met each other in middle school and were best friends in high school. It just felt like one of those things that was meant to be. Both had similar lives and similar goals, brought up in the same town, had all the same values. About 6-7 months into the relationship I ended things because it felt like I wasn\u2019t being valued in the way I deserved and that our romantic relationship was ruining the friendship we had built for years. \n\nAfter we broke up we stayed friends. It was difficult through her boyfriends and trying to somehow stay neutral. And I\u2019m sure she felt the same when I dated other people. I remember once before our senior homecoming we went in the same group and her and I just ended up talking all of dinner, because it just felt so natural, our dates also there with us. \n\nI know it sounds mean, but my plan when we graduated high school was to just remove myself from her life. Make it easier for me to move on. But when COVID hit I felt like I needed everyone in my life close to me to stay. \n\nI ended up moving away to college and she stayed at home. When I go back to visit her it\u2019s always so bittersweet because I love seeing her and being around her, but I know she doesn\u2019t feel the way I feel. Last time I was home we just sat and stared at city lights and talked for hours, it reminded me how easy it is to put my guard down. \n\nNow we\u2019ve started snap chatting a lot more and it makes me miss her a lot. Recently she was at a party and kept sending me videos of her making funny faces and other silly things. I don\u2019t know it was just a little too much for my heart. By the end of the night she sent an \u201cI miss you text\u201d which I responded too with the affirmative. \n\nIt\u2019s just hard because ever since her I just know I haven\u2019t felt the same for anyone else. Like trust me I\u2019ve tried to move on so so many times. But she just keeps getting brought back into my life. And it\u2019s not even the wholesome emotions I haven\u2019t been able to feel again, like I just haven\u2019t felt passionate about someone in so long. When I hook up with people I just feel so detached from it all. Idk. I\u2019m just lost. And I miss her. But I feel like I gotta let her go. For my own sake I just gotta say good bye maybe.

In that post, I briefly mentioned my female friend and former crush, Lilly, and the role she played in shaping me into the depressed, near-suicidal High School junior I am today. Well, I figured I should hope on and elaborate on that story now that we have to be together every day this week for four hours. \n\nIt all started in January, after I had been ejected from the group chat. I figured, if I could confide in anyone, it would be Lilly, since\n\n1. I\u2019m depressed and want to die, and she always lifts me up when I feel down\n\n2. We\u2019re both Christians, and have also been able to bond through that during times of sadness\n\n3. She\u2019s known Cole (my ex-best friend) longer than I have, and I know she\u2019s always ready to talk some sense into him, given his questionable behavior in school\n\nSo I give her a run-down of the whole situation. The change in the group\u2019s atmosphere, the abandonment, and how badly it all fucked me up mentally. Her final deduction was, after I had already left class with an excuse to talk to the guidance counselor several times, that I was just jealous that Cole had a girlfriend, and I was making up all these feelings for attention.\n\ncue fight\n\ncue me seriously considering suicide in my bedroom late at night when my phone rings. It\u2019s Lilly.\n\nShe wanted to call and make sure that, after our fight, I hadn\u2019t considered or attempted anything self-damaging, and that I was alright. She admitted to me that, after her ex-friend lied about self-harming a year ago, she\u2019s had trust issues when it comes to stuff like this. I decide to forgive and forget, and she assures me that I can talk to her about all of my negative feelings, Cole-related or otherwise.\n\nCut to March. Cole has been dumped, and he now hates me because I won\u2019t rejoin the group on his say so. I vent to Lilly about this. Lo and behold we\u2019re right back at square fucking one. I called her out on the fact that we\u2019ve already done this before and that she promised she would be open and understanding, and she PROMISES me that I\u2019m being over dramatic, 100% positive. Once again, she apologizes late at night, this time over text. What the hell, forgive and forget. \n\nThis happened 3 more times over the course of March.\n\nBut the tipping point for me came just a month ago.\n\nLet me preface this next part with a snippet of the text convo from the first time this happened:\n\n\u201cDepression and suicide are not something to joke about or say for dramatic effect.\u201d\n\nLadies and gentlemen, on June 12, 2021 at 7:09 pm, she logs into our group chat with Jack (from the group chat I was kicked from), and says, \u201cI wanna DiE!\u201d\n\nI, pretty justifiably I think, ask her why she\u2019s joking about that when a few months ago she told me not to when I actually did want to die.

I would ask if he could spare a day- any day of the week or a weekend to spend with me but his answer was always the same, \"oh no! I'm busy\". I accepted the case and spent time alone, sad, and lonely. Over time, things didn't add up and I wondered what was happening, why was he too busy for me, only me? I wanted to trust him, but since he's been pretty shady at times, I had a hunch he was hiding something, something he didn't want me to see or find out about, something that felt like a betrayal so I began spying, stalking, and watching silently to find out what he's got to hide, and what I found on his profile, it sent shivers down my spine. He was sexting others while sexting me-I also sexted other guys but this is the one I had feelings for, so I'm just a toy huh? But of course, he willingly admitted to it when I asked about it. I felt broken and betrayed but he said we're still friends, after all, we talk about other stuff besides doing sexting between each other. I was still pissed by what he did and gradually, I began to lose trust in him. But, I still loved him very much, even though the things he did took a toll on our friendship. We quit sexting weeks ago for the sake of our faith, he went back to sexting after a while but I stayed back, however, we remained friends and were very open to each other despite our history. He became shadier and shadier, which began to hurt cause I won't be able to confess my feelings to him. I loved him with all my heart, I would listen patiently as he vents about his pain. I would take his side always. I comforted him when he felt hurt. But never once did he notice that love was in front of him, never once did he realize that you don't have to be nude to express your love towards someone. After all the time I invested in spending with him, I was nothing more than \"just a friend\". Feeling hurt and broken, I would vent out to others about how I feel- this is where it turned ugly. Yesterday, some guy wanted me to sext but since I refused to, he messaged my \"friend\", said some stuff about me, saying that I will blackmail. And this morning/afternoon, we were fighting about that message, calling me a stalker and that we need to distance for a while, I take that as months, year(s).\n\nI live to regret what I've done to him; telling others about him without his consent and stalking him.

She was loving, she would care about strangers even, she was so intelligent, so fun to be around. We lived together for 5 years and not once was I bored around her. We could talk each other's ears off and get as giddy as children without fear of the other judging us. We conquered all sorts of battles in life, our mantra was that together, we could do anything.

This is an issue on my account though as to why I\u2019m so lonely, I find it really difficult to open up to people and I lie instead of showing my true feelings because I\u2019m scared - I\u2019m unaware of what I am scared of, but I feel a soul consuming fear of opening up. This is proboably due to the fact that whenever I do open up, the person I tell some information to walks out of my life like a supermarket, they leave and don\u2019t turn back - and to be fair, I don\u2019t blame them. Half the time I even open the door for them.\nI can\u2019t even help people because I\u2019m a good person, I help people from a very selfish place - I help them so they feel a need to give me something back, and thus a reason to stay in my life. I just helped my friend (or someone I would call a friend but i don\u2019t think they would call me one) through a tough time - I spent 4 straight days helping them with it. It was getting into their Snapchat account, so not very rough, but I know it means a lot to them. I helped them because they have a video in their Snapchat memories that I want, and also because when I opened up to her she walked out my life and I want to keep her in mine. She got into her account, didn\u2019t even message me from it - just moved in like I did nothing, and I have become aware after I had helped her that she will just leave me again. I wish she was back in that situation just so she would continue to talk to me - it is what it is though ig.

But I know deep down that I don\u2019t deserve it, and I shouldn\u2019t deserve it. I actively hate myself when I raise my issues to people, I feel like a major burden and that I\u2019m causing more issues then I\u2019m fixing, and I realise that I never mean as much to someone as I think I do. My mother recently informed me that she regrets having me, and I had my best friend round I\u2019ve the weekend, she spent most of the time on call with her best friend, that was an enjoyable time indeed. It hurts to think that I put people in a pedestal who don\u2019t even seem to fully notice what I do to help them - but I also know that if I left it probably wouldn\u2019t affect them, but I try tell myself they would be lost without me because I\u2019m to scared to leave everything behind and move on knowing I would be lost without them but they would be fine without me. \nThat\u2019s just a snippet of how I feel rn, and yeah", "title": "Loneliness"}, {"created_utc": 1627942609, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/owpar2/want_it_to_end/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "It's hard to believe that something so small can put me in such an awful depressive spiral that I'm starting to wonder why I'm even here.

I'm getting over it okay, but there are things that make me sad and bitter. My parents didn't plan adequately.

Selling their home down here WAS going to fund their retirement. And be money towards renovating the house up there and building a pole building to house his many collector cars and vehicles. Then they would also have my dad's pension and their social security and disability insurance. And now my dad is dead and my mom has to deal with boats and like a dozen plus cars and she needs to sell the house... And then what? She can't live up north by herself, but she doesn't think she will have the money to rent down here. According to her, they didn't plan on having a monthly payment (like rent).   She doesn't even know what to do with everything. Take it all up north 4 hours away? That's costly for those trips and then to bring stuff back again if she gets a smaller house down here or if she rents. \n\nI'm sad and bitter because I told her years ago that the recommended amount people save for retirement is at least a million. And she chose to bury her head in the sand and ignore me.

I mean, let\u2019s face it\u2026..90% of the time, people reject people because they believe that they can do better than the person who asked them out (there are exceptions like differing sexual orientations or if you already liked the person but know the timing isn\u2019t right for whatever reason but you get the point). And knowing that\u2026..it only adds to the already established insecurities\u2026.especially when the other person thinks they did find better.

I started hitting the gym more, I was reading daily, preparing for the next year of uni early, seeing more girls, making more time for friends and family, quitting drugs etc. Now, as motivational as it is I just want the thought to leave my head but it just floats back in throughout the day.

Today their breakup was about 1 year and 5 months ago, and he still has such intense feelings for her, and has destroyed his mental wellbeing because of this girl he is obsessed with. I'm telling you that part because the last thing I want to do is end up like that.\n\n\nI miss her a lot. We dated for a lot less (21 days-ish), but she was the only girl that I could say to myself \"Wow, I really love this girl. I would like to spend my life with her if that's alright.\" She was the first to say the three special words, and broke up with me aboutttttt a few days after that exact intimate moment. She told me that it wasn't me, and that she just needed to work on herself. It's easy to predict that I was heartbroken. I understood and respected her decision, but holy fuck did it sting. We talked it out a few weeks after the breakup, and I eventually came to the conclusion that we should stay friends until she learns to love herself. I took those feelings and just shoved them into the back of my head. It hurt, but I did it for her.\n\nOver the summer she took a much needed vacation. It was to her hometown in another country, she hadnt been in years and she was excited to spend most of the summer there. Before she left however, she texted me saying that she still had intense feelings for me, and that she didn't want me to lose those feelings that *I* had. I felt so conflicted, and before I know it she's left.\n\nI have loved this girl for months, and after being pushed away after giving her my all and everything, I felt ready to close the chapter. My feelings are still somewhat intact, but most of it is destroyed, not only because of her actions, but because I spent a summer without her there besides me. She's been back from her hometown for over a week now, and we barely speak. Whenever I text her, I get nothing except one-sentence texts. I'm scared to reach out, and I just am afraid to put myself out there. I have a fear that I'll be greatly hurt one more time. I think about the \"what if?\" A lot.

I went back to my car to see that my order was ready however a person went to the window and showed the lady that the message said his was ready and she said his wasn\u2019t so I was too afraid to ask whether mine was ready or not but the bored outside was clearly broken as multiple people who\u2019s orders were ready wasn\u2019t on the board.

Feel free to pm me to talk as i\u2019ll take all the support i can get. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nPart 1: \n\n\nI\u2019m 20 &amp; I\u2019ve previously posted in this sub before but now i\u2019m gonna post about my depression in it\u2019s entirety. \ngrowing up i had a SHIT TON of dramatic stuff happen: grew up around a partying parent which led into alcoholism (worst trauma by far) death of dad at 13, death of my grandmother at 15 and now currently my ongoing depression. \n\nparents alcoholism: my mom took care of my 2 brothers &amp; i, by herself basically her entire 20\u2019s when she all of us in just under 4 years. My dad wasn\u2019t around ever really &amp; my mom did a good ass job taking care of us in my opinion. She had an issue with partying and alcoholism but she still managed to keep us well rounded &amp; on a routine to get to school everyday, and be functioning normal kids for our age. My early years consisted of very faint memories but from what I remember they were nothing like the years I remember more vividly. The only trauma i have from back then is one time, when my father hit my mom\u2019s current boyfriend over the head with a pipe &amp; completely bloodied his face resulting in obviously a traumatic scene for a 6 year old. Besides that there was nothing really until i got older &amp; the alcoholism became more apparent. A few years later when i was around 9 i moved neighborhoods &amp; my mom socially decided to move on away from that area, along with that lifestyle she was living (or so i thought)\nall was well when we first moved as we were closer to her family (my grandparents) and she was away from that toxic area filled with just drama &amp; trauma for her &amp; us. As time proceeded on she began to drink solely by herself more and more frequently. There would be week long stretches where she would just drink drink drink till she literally couldn\u2019t do it anymore &amp; was sick on the couch for a day or two, resulting in us having to essentially take care of her at the ages of 8,10 and 11. This was an ongoing thing for YEARS and is still an issue right now but for the purpose of limiting this post I won\u2019t talk about this any further. The trauma from that comes in many different ways, from seeing my mom literally get dragged home by a stranger (who could have easily raped / killed her), to having cops come to our house, and years of just seeing my mom just physically &amp; emotionally hurt herself from alcohol abuse. I went to school worrying, as a child, as to what mom i was going to come home to that very night. Was it gonna be the mom who forgets we exist &amp; neglects us for a week straight? Or was it going to be her normal self who is the complete opposite. The fear of worrying about her sobriety when i went to school was something i dealt with from ages 9-16 regularly which I honestly think is a major reason i have the anxiety that i do today. \n\nDeath of dad: this one will be shorter but my dad wasn\u2019t around much as he too was dealing with substance abuse in a more severe form. He and his girlfriend were always nice people from what I remember, but as i got older i have begun to realize the issue that they both had in common, hard drugs. I don\u2019t think i was ever in the presence of him doing drugs &amp; same with his girlfriend, but i do know all the facts now that i\u2019m older &amp; i can definitely see why this was true and why he was never around consistently in my life. My mom and him didn\u2019t get along &amp; she always bad mouthed him for it (which I didn\u2019t understand) but knowing what i know now about both sides (mom &amp; dad) it doesn\u2019t make sense &amp; it\u2019s honestly sad that my mom manipulated me as a child into hating my father for not being around given everything that she did while we were in her presence. On December 27th 2013 my father died suddenly at age 37 to pneumonia out of the blue. I honestly didn\u2019t know what pneumonia was up until years later, and after speaking to my mom about it &amp; figuring out what it was, i began to put the pieces together rather quickly as to how he died from this usually non lethal infection. He was abusing substances the days before passing away, so obviously in the mind of someone using he obviously thought it was just some sort of cold or something which is why he never went in to get an actual evaluation for his health. It\u2019s honestly heartbreaking to know the way he died (drowning in his sleep) due to fluids in his lungs (pneumonia) &amp; that a simple trip to a doctors office &amp; antibiotics would mean he would still be alive right now. it\u2019s something i literally think about alot at this time of the night just because of how unlucky I truly am, At the age of 13 i lost the chance at ever getting to see my father again &amp; the chance at possibly ever getting to reconnect &amp; have an actual relationship with my dad all because of substance abuse. My father\u2019s funeral was by far the MOST traumatic day of my life &amp; for good reason. Days before the funeral i was adamant about not wanting to go at all &amp; wanting to stay home to dismiss any feelings for him &amp; the situation. As the days went on my mom said it\u2019ll be the biggest regret of my life if I didn\u2019t go and didn\u2019t get to say goodbye and for that reason solely I decided to go to his funeral to say my goodbyes. Going into the funeral I didn\u2019t know there were different funeral types but when i got there i sure figured that out quickly. When i got there i was greeted by family I haven\u2019t seen in years &amp; ironically it was one of the happiest days of my life because they were such crucial components of my childhood &amp; were apart of many good memories from early on in my life. After all the greetings and love from family &amp; friends of my dads, we were entered the funeral home to say our goodbyes to my father. Right when i walked into the door in the corner of my eye i saw a disfigured almost wax looking figure in my view &amp; immediately looked away thinking it was the corpse of someone else\u2019s funeral. About 20 minutes into being there my dad\u2019s father asked us if we are ready to go say our goodbyes and of course I reluctantly agreed. Upon walking up there i felt no emotion whatsoever until getting closer &amp; closer until eventually i was able to analyze my fathers dead body just sitting there in a casket lifeless. It\u2019s was honestly horrifying based on the fact that it looked like a fake wax figure clone was in the casket replacing him when in reality thats just what a dead lifeless body looks like. After standing there for like 30 seconds i began to sob just purely based on fear &amp; realization that my father was actually dead and that there was no way to avoid it this time. Every possible emotion was going through my head in regards to him &amp; everything that happened and from what I remember, I instantly left after that to get fresh air due to the fact that i was basically having a panic attack from what i had just saw. A few hours later we went to the funeral yard to bury him, and all I remember from that event was standing as far away as possible from the casket to get the day over with &amp; out of my memory for life. I obviously threw a rose on the casket as it was lowered, but asides from that i had very minimal involvement just based purely on the trauma i experienced already in that day. \n\nmy granny: my granny was the stereotypical older woman in life that would make all her neighbours cookies &amp; was just honestly the sweetest person on the earth. She was the most generous &amp; lovely person ever to grace my life &amp; is someone i miss dearly to this day. When my mom would drink back when we were younger, our granny would always know just instincts &amp; would come over for a week or two to help straighten everything out &amp; help my mom out with her addiction. She would cook us food &amp; do everything she could to make everything completely better. She was just the most amazing person ever &amp; is someone who words can\u2019t describe truthfully. Losing her was 10x more traumatic for me then losing my dad &amp; honestly i cannot tell you why. I will forever miss her Christmas gifts of small useful items, her kindness, and just her overall presence and amazing energy. January 4th 2015 in the midst of one of my moms drinking outbursts she randomly blurts out that my granny dies right when i come home from school. At first, obviously with her being drunk i asked her what the hell she was talking about &amp; not to say that until she told me she was telling the gods honest truth with tears in her eyes. I honestly will forever remember that day due to the fact that it was an awful day at school, and an even worse day when i got back home later that day. A days or two later my aunt wanted the entire family to just get together and see each-other after what had happened &amp; the look on my grandfathers face and the emotions he had will forever touch a string in my heart till the day i die. He was known for being stoic &amp; never emotional but to see the love of his life die the way that she did &amp; to experience it after 40+ years together it has to be the saddest thing I\u2019ve experienced in my life not for myself but just for him. The funeral itself was traumatic just because i was numb to the situation &amp; it still didn\u2019t feel real, but when I realized what happened i was in shock &amp; broke down the most i ever have in my life (besides my dad\u2019s funeral). My granny suddenly died on her way to cuba for her yearly vacation out of the blue. She felt severely ill on the plane and as soon as they landed in Camaguey she was rushed to the hospital and put on iv\u2019s.

I was having fun playing this game and all of a sudden the girl I like,( who so happens to be the person who's constantly inviting me over) gets the question \"who do you want to leave out of everyone here?\" and it landed on heads and she didn't have to shout it out, but decided to anyways. It was me, out of my friend, her friend, and her adopted brother(who she hates). Then afterwards they continue the game and slander me trying to either make me leave, or just hurt my feelings. I don't know why they invited me over if they didn't want to hang out with me. Also my friend had just met them today, so it really sucked. I really hate being a guy because I just have to deal with it and stop hanging out with them, so now I have basically no friends and I'm back to being lonely.

I'm asking just because I never felt close with my dad specifically for certain reasons, like all our conversations are very superficial, mostly due to the language gap between us in contrast to me and my mom. It's always been a quiet understanding since forever, but now that I'm 18+ in college it bothers me even more. It's frustrating because he is depressed from giving up his old life when I was born to come to canada and is isolated from his career as an online business worker, but he never makes any effort to talk to me (or my mom really) anymore. He is aging (late 50s), so I respect him and his needs, but if you're just waking up each and everyday just surviving, getting chores done, and helping me and my mom out with daily tasks for the sake of us being \"your family\", it's kind of toxic in a way. Like yeah biologically I am your daughter, but sometimes it's like he pretends that he knows me and what I am thinking about his behaviour despite knowing very superficial details about my life. Now you may be inclined to comment that I should then simply solve this by talking to him, with the help of my mom to translate, but it's not the case here. This has been going on for a long time, especially since all the holiday events where my mom has yelled at him numerous times about everything I just explained (so my mom is also on the same page as me here and is frustrated). I write this now because this happened again during dinner, where we were eating but then randomly in the meal my mom straight up tells my dad to talk and that the whole point of a dinner is to talk with each other as talking is what makes humans happy. Then seconds later when my mom steps out for awhile, my dad starts asking super basic questions about my life, some out of context, and while I responded like I would politely to anyone, it's really obvious how fake his intentions are. Like he is \"rehearsing\" from a script.I don't know. I just wanted to let this out because I'm already busy with a lot of things in m life so this is just annoying. I'm so thankful though, that I have so many amazing friends in my life, near or far, so I won't always feel alone.

Finally become stable, everything's going well, then BAM it's time to fuck all that up. It's fucking exhausting. \n\nMy boyfriend came home from a meeting with his family about their business finances. He mentioned about them all getting a piece of land, and then build our own house, with literally whatever we want. Sounds great right? Well here's the thing. A couple years ago, my bf and I had a custody battle with his family for my kids. It all started after the birth of my 2nd baby. This lasted for like 1.5 years, only letting me see her on weekends only. Didn't invite us to her first birthday party. We missed all of her firsts. I never got the chance to have a bond with her. She also had already bonded with his sister. So when we got the kids back. It was HELL. Our bonding issue was a problem every single day and it made me feel like complete shit everyday. I eventually decided it was probably the right thing to sign my rights over to his sister. So we did.\n\nFast forward to now. My bf and I had another baby. So we have 2 kids now, in a perfect house for us. Well my bf comes back home from the meeting and I was excited to hear what all had happened. Instead, he just drops a bomb on me. He's actually wanting to use the land and build his dream house. Thing is, all of his family members would also be in the area, building their own houses. Meaning, we'd all be neighbors. I can't do that. I can't be around the daughter I gave up. Every time I'm around her, she acknowledges my bf (her dad), my oldest (sister), but just completely by passes me. Wants nothing to do with me and it hurts to see that every time I see her.  I don't want to be around the people that had a part in ruining my life. And then he says \"OK so they're all gonna get to build their own $1million houses and I get screwed cause I'm not building it\". He also mentions that he'd like to be around the daughter more but I don't. I can't. I will die if I have to do this. And of course I'm going to feel like complete shit if I'm the reason he doesn't do it.\n\nI really thought our life was finally becoming stable and okay but I keep getting bombs like this and I'm tired. I'm tired of having that feeling of dread that one day, he's gonna want to move or whatever, and not care about how I feel. I'm also being resented by my bf and my daughter because I said I can't be around the other daughter and it fucking hurts so bad. \n\nAll I keep thinking about right now, is how I'm really mad at myself for not using my one LAST chance to finally end it all and I didn't do it.

My last 3 years in high school were bitter sweet. I made mistakes memories and friends throughout. But the last year of school was a roller coaster and the most memorable. It includes me Male and her  female spanish exchange student. All the years leading up to the 12th grade, i was in relationships almost every other month with no problem and making a lot of mistakes in those relationships. Well, I thought i would calm down in my last year and take it slow. The story starts with me choosing what classes i would enrole in the first semester. There was a whole bunch of classes to choose from, but I decided to take musical theater. Long story short i found out it wasn't for me so i had my councelor switch me to an ourdoor ed class (my second passion the outdoors.) When i entered the outdoor ed classroom there were a bunch of familiar faces and a lot of new ones as well. To my suprise, a female co-worker of mine was in the class as well. Things go great for the first two classes, then I noticed this girl (changed name for privacy) irain staring at me. My friend gave me the scoop on her. I thought nothing of it at the time and kept on living my life. Mind you, I wasn't looking for love at the time. By the end of the 5th class , we exchanged snapchats and started talking. Our relationship kept growing from there. It's funny how you can find love in the odest times of your life. We did everything together, go to school functions, hang out after and during school. She even slept over a couple of times. And yes, we did sleep together multiple times that I couldn't even remember. I started getting really close to her, maybe too close because I didn't think about the consequences of us breaking up. Suprise! Yes, we broke up. We planned a trip to a big city near us for my birthday. her host dad and my mom were all good with her coming. But before that happened, covid really took a hit on rules and mandates. That plan was canceled. She left a day before my birthday and my mental health started deteriorating from there. My dad kicked me out, and  I had to find a job. I got a job as a shipper receiver worked 10 hours a day and had no one to come home to. I still don't. I get really lonely sometimes and wonder why I don't have any more friends. My self esteem is gone. I dont think i can find someone that is willing to give me a chance. I once thought of my self as the main character that was full of life and joy but now i push my self farther into the backround. Sometimes i think im usless and i fuck up too much. I sometimes dream about Irain. Why do i still do this? I dont know. Why does my heart still ache when i hear her name after a whole year is coming to pass soon, i would like to know the answer. Why cant i move on. Why do i feel lonely. I feel like going out kurt cobain style. Oh and the reason why sorta is in the title is because i didn't graduate highschool.

I have been stuck making minimum wage or below it, so I was hoping that tax season would help me out. It did not, and I owe over $1000 again. This happened last year, but I thought I filed everything right this time so even though it's not as much as last year it still took me off guard and I just don't have the money. I don't want my parents in my financial situation, so I don't want to reach out to them for anything.\n\nTime, time, time, is the second conflict. I want to do hustles on the side but constantly feel burnt out. I work full time and my two days off are not consecutive. I think sometimes about getting a second job but I know I can't afford giving up more time, and then most definitely I couldn't get in the art and passive income I want to do. Same goes for working out and cleaning my mess of a depression room.\n\nIf I could move out with friends I would, but I have none that are reliable. We're all broke b\\*tches. There are a couple of main candidates, but they decided to move out with other friends so those weren't really opportunities. I also don't really feel that close to anyone. There are some friends where I feel like I am a nuisance. I was really introverted before I went to college, and then I met a lot of valuable people who I'd spend every day with. I'd be the couch nomad who'd stay over and wake up really early before anyone to clean up from the night before, and then I'd be on my way and off to class. I miss that family feeling and often look to hang out with someone every day, but back at home I only have a handful of friends within driving distance, and I can just tell that I am too much at times. I just want a nice friend group to adopt me :(\n\nThere was a boy I started talking to last year, and I really admired him. I shot my shot and he shot me down, but we were still really good online friends (we're in the same area but almost all of our conversations were via apps) and I was sad about being rejected but completely fine if it meant I at least had a new friend I could share my interests with. Out of the blue he blocked me, and I found out it was because he was interested in another girl and she got suspicious over the fact he had a 200+ day streak with someone else, so I had to go. I'm still mourning that. Before it happened, I talked to a medium who told me my love life was going to be bare for a while. To test this theory, I tried talking to someone on Tinder. He blocked me the next morning with no context, so I guess I'll listen to the universe on that one.\n\nAll of this is on me as I'm going to bed last night. I go to charge my iPad because she's dead and then I find out that I neglected that \"Storage too Full\" warning one to many times. I left that for me to worry about this morning, and now I'm coming to terms with the fact that she is f\\*cked and won't turn on past the logo. This happened with a phone of mine before and I had to do a complete factory reset, but I really don't want to do that because all of my edited photos, important videos, and Procreate files are gonna get wiped out. Maybe I need a fresh start, but I don't know how I could even do that thanks to Apple switching over to new ports that aren't USB. So I'll probably have to go buy an adapter with money I don't have to spend hours I don't have to get this thing turned on, only to find I don't have my files... not something I'm looking forward to.\n\nTLDR: I'm sad, lonely, and technologically struggling.

I guess he just had more self confidence then I did. There were things she did that i am now looking back on that coulda been signs that she liked me but at the time i was just thinking that its normal y'know like we're friends.

Just moved to NC from Jersey, and moving in the middle of high school obviously isn\u2019t ideal. I know absolutely no one and have been at this school since August. I\u2019m not an introverted person, nor do I have social anxiety. I always try to talk to people and spark up conversations with anyone close by. In my old friend group, I was always the one who organized the plans and also usually asked if anyone wanted to hop on cod. But now I\u2019m just burnt out. I drift from class to class with my AirPods in. I probably don\u2019t speak to more than 5 people in a given day, 4 of which being my teachers. Lunch is the most stressful though. The way our seats work is there are a bunch of tables with like 5 built in seats, so you can\u2019t pull any chairs over. Everyday I walk in and all the chairs are instantly full, and one time I tried sitting down at one, but they asked me to leave because I was taking someone\u2019s spot. Now I usually fake a headache so I can sit in the nurses office, do random things on my computer in the library to kill the time, or sit outside on the patio with my head down. I never used to kind school, actually enjoyed it. I had a lot of friends so I would talk to kids in the hall, and in all of my classes I had a lot of friends to talk too. Now, my days are repetitive and boring, with the same thing to expect each and every day. I still talk to my friends though, If I didn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t know how to manage. It is really sad though when all of them call me on a Friday night at the mall, or movies, and I\u2019m just here. Lying on my bed and listening to mac miller. Every night, it\u2019s the same deal. Some times I cry, sometimes i sleep, and other times I watch Netflix. I\u2019m lost. I joined my local soccer team to attempt to meet people, but still haven\u2019t. I played soccer for about 14 years and looking to play in college. I never labeled myself as depressed because everytime I hear that word I associate it with middle schoolers who want attention. I know it\u2019s not true, but it\u2019s how I look at it. But I do think I am at this point. In addition to all of this, we moved down with my grandma. She was everything to me and had the brightest personality. She was my rock. She always laughed at my jokes, no matter how inappropriate they were. On September 10th, she was walking early in the morning and got hit by a car. She died. This made everything worse. I know it\u2019s a horrible thought, but I put some of the blame on my parents for moving us here. It sucks. I hate it. My aunt told me her biggest worry was me, and how she didn\u2019t know how I would acclimate here. She said that\u2019s all she ever wanted for me, was to be happy, but I don\u2019t know how. I know I\u2019m getting off track, sorry. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here. I never usually post on Reddit. Just felt like telling someone. If you\u2019re still here, thank you.

As someone who has personally dealt with my own and my ex's mental health I can tell you it's not an easy thing for you or them to understand. Truthfully these issues can scare people away and make someone more hesitant to tell you why something went wrong in a relationship because they feel telling you would only hurt you more.\n\n(Also... as someone with mental health issues.. as sad as it is to say.. we can't blame anyone from leaving either.. as we tend to self sabotage and push people away for some reason, usually the ones we love the most)\n\nI've spent so much wasted time punishing myself for things that were out of my control... It's not fair to you, please try to understand that. It's funny, as humans we tend to love ourselves the least yet have to live with ourselves from the day we are born till the day we die. It's often when we cut ourselves slack and learn our own importance we can actually BE the person we want to be.. in turn leading to the people we want around us to be around.\n\nAlso I know how it feels wanting something to be how it used to be and how far that rabbit hole can go.. The pressure it puts on someone... Making them feel forced or the situation between you forced. But what usually makes people bond is how effortless it usually is.. So this is unfortunately usually us; unknowingly, sabotaging our own happiness.\n\nEven as I say these things... While my ex did do terrible things.. I did too. It's only natural to lash out, after all we tend to fight for what we love, don't we? It sadly doesn't come off that way most of the time..\n\nI will add this too, I know I said we can't really blame people for leaving.. But that doesn't make it necessarily true in every scenario. The first year I was with my ex she dealt with night terrors.. literally every night.. It was awful and she didn't have the best childhood either. While I worked a job that was hard physical labor for 8-12hrs a day. There was not one thing in this world that stopped me from getting up every single time she had an episode and stroking her hair which was the only thing that helped (she dealt with migraines and such even going partially blind in one eye sometimes). With that being said.. everyone is different and can put up with different levels of things like that. To me I would have done it the rest of my life if I had to.. \n\n \n\nTo give context my ex and I spent about 3-4 years tied at the hip. Literal best fucking friends. Being with her was as natural as breathing air... During this time it was her and I against the whole world and straight killing it. Her mother was my boss actually and that's how we met. Her mom and I became like best friends and I ended up being heavily involved in knowing most her siblings. I could never imagine her not being in my life in some type of way...\n\nThroughout our relationship we were there for each other. I helped her and her mom find a new place and we lived together.. happily. Actually some of the best moments of my life.. I remember waking up on her moms birthday to decorate the house and make her favorite food.. countless bbq's..\n\nWe ended up saving 4 kittens after finding their mother dead behind where we worked and would end up keeping one, Bella, who I still have. Then we got a dog, Draco, who I sadly don't anymore.. Ended up getting our own place. She like literally gave me a reason to do something in my life... Like before I met her I had just been content.. with... just staying still. She made me want to move mountains.\n\nI even remember when she worked at a dog kennel... she fell breaking both her elbows. You know how crazy it is being someone's arms for them? Lmao.. (this was even after I found out she cheated). In my mind I had found my person... Took them for exactly who they were and not a version I had made up in my head.\n\nAfter the second time I found out she was cheating again... Well to put it in perspective in or 3-4 years together it was always genuine... Until like the last month or two. My world, so easily destroyed...\n\nOver the next year she would still come in and out of my life... She did some real.. shady things.. We'd still have the same love but, she was just changing. We'd stop contact from there until about a year ago.\n\nThis point I had actually started seeing someone new, she was bright.. sunny, happy full of life. This person was in my life for a month when I decided to hit up my ex.. (Joz).. Just cause I literally missed her, she was family.\n\nWith no intentions of being anything more than friends... and I don't just say this lightly.. she manipulated the love we had and used it against me. She had literally moved out of state thousands of miles away. During this time I helped move the rest of the stuff out of her old apartment she had with her (now) ex gf, yep she was bi but I knew that. She'd also ask me to arrange her storage unit and grab some things she left unfinished.\n\nI know I may seem dumb at this point, but.. Like I'm not gunna tell you no if you need help. The true manipulation started when she started to pull me back in with apologies and lies.. We always wanted to have kids and she brought that up..\n\nThis girl knew I was hers and used it well. I won't sit here and try to make her seem terrible though while I let it happen. I knew her and could see the things she was saying were mostly genuine. Over time it became more genuine and more, until the girl I was currently seeing caught on.\n\nAt this point I would spiral. Leaving for 5 days without contacting anyone. This would end up to me losing the control I did have in the company I was involved in and having to switch jobs....\n\nI would start working for her mom again. Joz would plan a trip back that we were both excited for... like it seemed that way, anyways....\n\nTurns out days before she comes things get cloudy, as apparently she had been seeing someone... never mentioned to me.. Basically ghosts me, but I did get a chance to see her.. for 15 minutes.\n\nThen I would leave and she'd call, apparently mad I didn't bring all the crystals I had of hers... Before we would get in a small argument which lead to her ghosting me completely for 6-7 months.\n\nUntil a couple days before Christmas that is. In my \"you must fight for love\" mindset I created an elaborate plan to try and get her to talk to me. (I had only tried to reach out 1 time prior in the months of ghosting). I basically told her that I didn't deserve to be treated like this.. I explained that because I knew she cared about me she would reach out.. because I wasn't going to wait.\n\n \n\nWanna know what I got?\n\nI deleted the text... oh sorry the 2 texts.\n\nFirst one read \"You have talked to me when I needed time\" or something and then \"Merry Christmas,\"...........\n\nMonths prior this girl cried her eyes out promising to be there for me, asked to be forgiven.. but she already was.. Told me she needed me, cried to me...\n\nLife... Truly makes no sense.. But I wish her the very best from the bottom of my heart. I hope she finds what she's looking for.. I hope she can be happy.\n\nShe was the only person that consumed my soul in that type of way... Cheating, even looking or thinking about someone else never crossed my mind. It's really crazy how something like 'love' can leave you not only emotionally but physically damaged. Also, not knowing is the absolute worst. Just leaving.. Not saying anything or giving a reason... Like you're gunna blame yourself for one, but it's even worse than that. \n\nYou have no sense of security in your own feelings.. You feel hot cold, up and down. Our brain's inherently will come to conclusions about the things we care about most just like when you forget a title to a song or movie and proceed to stop everything your doing to look up the answer.. \n\nSo with no conclusion it's basically like a bouncy ball just bouncing around up there.. not fair. Don't feel bad about trying to forget, it's only natural. This last time she ghosted me... ehh, I just had known in my very core... I had earned a place in her life. It wasn't expected by any means, but I had done all of the \"be a good friend\" things. \n\nNot because I felt obligated but because I wanted too... which often meant answering video calls at 4am to her crying.. In a new big city with not many friends, I was there. So, while it hurts.. At this point I feel like i've been putting in all of me and in doing so came to the conclusion that.. it's truly her loss. I was good to her.. I can sleep well at night knowing that. Also I can reflect on her and see the valuable lessons I needed to learn... after all I can't let someone fool me over and over and over.. Ya know?\n\n I do, however miss that \"safe place\" feeling you get from having a someone.. Letting anyone into my life is extremely hard, likely due to abandonment issues / abuse. Never having those \"life long\" friends due to being shipped from town to town.. Never staying anywhere long enough to make lasting connections. So finding that safe spot has always seemed... Impossible, honestly. Like winning the lottery. \n\nOn blocking... I have to say i've never blocked her. I guess it made me feel good that I didn't need to, that I could control my actions and not reach out on my own. If that makes sense... Cause reaching out too much and trying too hard has always been an issue.

This is something I barely do. As my life progresses I\u2019ve realised a few things - mainly I\u2019m a mess. I can no longer pretend everything in life is going to mysteriously fall into place or simply the idea that soon everything is going to be \u2018alright\u2019. Let\u2019s get right into it. Truth is I\u2019ve never really known what I want from \u2018life\u2019 or what I\u2019ve been doing with my life for the majority of it. For example. Although this cannot possibly summarise the depths of what I\u2019m trying to explain. Some people want to be doctors. They work hard and become doctors. Essentially, there is a clear goal. My problem is during my time in school even up to university I just did things \u2018because\u2019. \n\n\u2018because\u2019 that\u2019s how it is. You\u2019re expected to get good grades and make your parents proud. I wanted to do well to keep my parents happy - and to keep them off my back. So I did the bare minimum to do so. I got good grades. Got into a good university but somewhere along the lines everything began to catch up to me. Long-story short I dropped out of university. I tired to blame a issue at home for my main reason of leaving but truth is I slowly became disconnected with was I was learning and everything had just became a chore. Unlike being in school - you don\u2019t get into trouble for not attending classes. In university if you miss deadlines or have poor attendance for classes/lectures there\u2019s no \u2018real\u2019 sort of repercussions -  I started smoking weed heavily in university and do think it may have worsened my feelings of disconnect or disengagement but a few things became clear to me: if I had some sort group project or work -  I would always go above and beyond - not for my sake, I know how important others value their degrees/courses and I never want to be the cause for anyone\u2019s misfortunes so I always pulled my weight. Then it occurred to me - I was still doing things just to do them. Just to \u2018keep up\u2019. Just to \u2018appear normal\u2019. Just to act as if I\u2019m getting on. Same as exams -  I always wanted to pass exams to avoid the feeling of failure - the exclusion felt from when you don\u2019t pass or do to well. Knowing that I\u2019m on the same steady pace as everybody else. In other words \u2018Safe\u2019. \nI can even apply this to sex. I had literally forced myself to have sex when I turned 20. Just so friends could stop asking me whether I was a virgin or not - the experience, I wouldn\u2019t even call  \u2018sex\u2019 nor \u2018enjoyable\u2019. I took a viagra pill and met this girl I had been speaking too. She claimed \u2018it went in\u2019 in my brain, meaning virginity lost, I left it there - I realised yet again I\u2019m just doing this \u2018because\u2019. \n\nAfter this encounter I never even tried to have sex with this girl again - it was like I had just checked something off my check list. Thinking back on this situation - it was embarrassing. She probably told her friends how bad my d*** game was but I was so oblivious at the time I never even thought this way. \nEssentially I did something just \u2018because\u2019 again.\nNot cause I want too but \u2018because\u2019 where I\u2019m from and the friends I had being a virgin at 20 is \u2018embarrassing\u2019 or not the \u2018norm\u2019. I remember being present at places where my friends had lost their virginity way younger than I did. I never really understood it. Maybe I was overthinking it and should just \u2018crush pus\u2019 like my other friends do - I had my own fair amount opportunities to lose my virginity even before I had turned 20 but just never felt the \u2018need\u2019 to have sex. So never did. I literally never pulled through whenever it really got down to business which made me question - why did I even speak to girls? Guess what. Just \u2018because\u2019 again. \u2018Because\u2019 my friends did it. \u2018Because\u2019 if you didn\u2019t - you\u2019re considered weird or gay. I remember I would literally rather watch porn than have sex with a girl I have no real care for or she has no real care for me but I\u2019m waffling off topic I hope this all just builds understanding for the \u2018just because\u2019 explanation I\u2019m trying to give.\n\n\nWhen I dropped out - I had returned home without knowledge to a terrible situation regarding my parents. My parents have never been together. It\u2019s the typical story of a broken family. Abuse. Dysfunction etc. You get the point. I could get into details but would probably need to make a entirely different post. \nThe main impact from this situation was that I was told a lot of things that were supposedly \u2018hidden\u2019 from me - I guess for my \u2018protection\u2019 . I was told my father used to abuse my mother. Which he denied. He never wanted me. He disowned my sister. Essentially it became a game of he said / she said. I had lived with both parents separately in the past -  on and off but such situation immensely destroyed my trust in anyone. I mean hearing my father never wanted me yet spending years living under his roof, eating his meals etc made me question whether it was ever love or something he just had to do. Unfortunately, as I grow older even if it was love or something he just had to do I understand it now. My mother is weak. I hate to admit but she\u2019s one of those people that are too good for the world. Overly Innocent. Too Kind. Vulnerable. Weak. My dad had claimed she had her own problems but as a boy, your mother is always your loving mother you don\u2019t question anything until you grow up. The hardest thing for me to fathom was I started seeing each of their points about each other.  The fact that my mother was a broken woman battling mental health problems for the majority of her life. Then my father who they claimed never aimed to raise a family. I have a older sister and things didn\u2019t go well with my father and her so I guess everything started \u2018making sense\u2019.\n\nIn university, my dad didn\u2019t visit me once - we rarely spoke but I had noticed our relationship becoming more than non-existent. I don\u2019t exactly know why. I mean I got into the best university I could have (Top 10-20 in my country at the time)  and had never really let him \u2018down\u2019. He had got married and kind of forgotten about me and it seemed like I was just permanently stuck with my mother. \nPlease don\u2019t think I hate my mum but as mentioned she was unstable I sadly only remember her more for her worse moments as it is what I can recall the most seeing. \nBut anyways. \nHere\u2019s the real problem:\n\nAfter dropping out. I had the house to myself I\u2019d say for about a good few months (only because my mother had fallen ill again due to her mental illnesses so I had the place to myself as in that state it wouldn\u2019t be healthy for her to be around me) This is where everything had caught up to me. I became insanely lonely to the point I had forgotten how to socialise - I would meet up with  old friends (people I\u2019ve known for years) and barely could think of sentences or keep conversations flowing but did so just \u2018because\u2019 I wanted to appear like everything was fine. Not only this. Me being alone for so long I started to dislike being around anyone. As I said my mother was unstable -  she could be smiling one day and crying the next so I had to always suppress myself or keep a \u2018guard\u2019 up. She would always pretend things were okay even when they weren\u2019t. I smoked weed almost everyday couldn\u2019t give you a WEEK where I went sober. I hadn\u2019t seen most of my  friends since I dropped out (year and a bit) and it just seemed everyone had forgotten about me. Phone was dry. Only here and there people would check up on me but then it all stopped. You would of thought having a free house to myself I would constantly have friends over or even host a party but truth is I was just drowning in depression. \nI\u2019ve been drowning in depression my whole life - I\u2019ve only realised my feelings of depression when I began university and properly had alone time - I realised I don\u2019t have any real connections or relationships with anyone. Never had an Ex and my friends we always were in groups which meant we never had to get too personal we were always just kind of in the moment.\n\nThe time I spent at home was during the Corona period (which is still going on?) The effects of my isolation began to creep up on me. I always had the blind shuts. My health was poor. Would barely wash or brush my teeth - take any care of myself unless I had to - had to meet a friend or had to do something where I had to look somewhat presentable -  when I went out. I realised how overly paranoid I look always questioning \u2018do I look normal\u2019  am I \u2018blending in\u2019 yet I never used to think this way before. One day I had noticed I usually start conversations with myself - a person on the train had caught me and I always went into a panic as I didn\u2019t even realise I was doing such thing so blatantly  - it got to the point I would pretend to be on the phone to just \u2018act\u2019 like I\u2019m talking to someone.\n\nAs a kid or a teenager if I had told you I was doing things like this no one would believe me as I never acted this way. I must add I lost a lot of hair during a young age and underwent surgery at a fairly young age too. I can\u2019t say the surgery went too well but during the process of the surgery and my recovery my life became even worse. it was summer, scorching hot. Obviously with the surgery my hair looked crazy. I had hair in my bald spots uneven to the rest of my natural hair. For a long time I felt I had to stay indoors and \u2018hide\u2019 away until this issue cleared - months and months passed and I soon started living the exact same day everyday. I felt I couldn\u2019t go out as my hair was uneven - I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to go to a barber shop in public nor take a walk or even just let my hair out I knew how bad this was for my recovery but a voice in my head wouldn\u2019t let me free. Try to understand from my perspective at a time in life my hair was bad but i could accept it -  I could go out with my hair out, confident - then it got to a point I couldn\u2019t - then I got surgery and had hair where I didn\u2019t but didn\u2019t know how to act as I never had hair there before. Do you understand? Also where I\u2019m from it\u2019s absolutely unheard of to do things like this - I had to essentially keep this a secret - I didn\u2019t tell anyone - I missed a lot of holidays, birthdays etc simply due to the fact I wasn\u2019t comfortable in my own skin and when people asked for reasonings I couldn\u2019t share the real reason as I was scared of being judged. \nBut yet again I didn\u2019t understand myself - why did I do this if even if the results were successful or not how would I go about it? It seems my whole life I had made decision without my heart fully wanting those decisions to be made. \nI wanted my hair back so I could look like everyone else \u2018because\u2019 everyone else had hair. I was like the only guy with hair problems in my entire school.

Not that these are bad things.\n\nBut right now I feel like an alien. I need to rebuild myself essentially restart life. \nIs there any films I can watch? Any books I can read?

I don\u2019t even want a girlfriend. I already know that. I only like the *idea* of having one, not the real thing. So I don\u2019t know why this is bothering me right now, but it is. I\u2019m covered in self-harm scars. They\u2019re all up my right arm, across my chest and stomach, my thigh, even up and down my back. There\u2019s no angle you could look at me from and not see a scar. \n\nI\u2019ve heard all the \u201cthey\u2019re not ugly\u201d and the \u201cthey\u2019re part of who you are\u201d and \u201cif you meet the right person, they won\u2019t judge you over them\u201d, but honestly I think it\u2019s bullshit. At least partially. Because people might try to believe that stuff on the surface, that\u2019s what they might think consciously when they see them, but there\u2019s a subconscious reaction that I think is impossible to avoid. \n\nNow I\u2019m not the type of person who normally gives two shits what other people think of me. Live my life alone, so people mean next to nothing to me in general. But one thing I really hate I when I feel like people see me as weak. And that\u2019s why my scars frustrate me so much, how to hell could I ever let anyone see them and not have them think of me as weak on some level after that? I don\u2019t think they could help it, subconsciously, if they saw that I\u2019ve self-harmed before and saw how much, it\u2019s kinda unavoidable to see that person as vulnerable, fragile, weaker than they were before. I don\u2019t think you can avoid seeing someone differently after seeing that. \n\nYou hear it in people\u2019s reactions all the time, it\u2019s always something like \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, it\u2019s sympathy. I don\u2019t want it, don\u2019t have any use for sympathy. Don\u2019t want someone to feel \u201csorry\u201d for me. But I can\u2019t avoid that reaction. Even if they say nothing, I\u2019ve seen it in their eyes before, back when I still forced myself to be around people and had casual encounters. I saw them look and there\u2019s always this same reaction, even if they say nothing about it. It makes me wanna call the whole thing off and kick them outta my fucking house. I hate it.\n\nI\u2019ve never experienced it in an actual relationship before, but I don\u2019t think I ever could anyway. Like I said at the start, I don\u2019t even want one, so I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m caught thinking about this but I am.

In 2019, I got a job as a call center agent which fucked me up so bad that it was making me physically sick to the point I was throwing up and was calling in sick 3-4x a week. I ended up quitting because the stressed was just too overwhelming for me (yes, I did go to a doctor for this. they did a scope on me and everything and determined it was nothing). At the job I just recently quit in July, \nI got on state insurance back in February and went to a doctor for a normal check up in July (a week before I quit) until for some reason my insurance started not going through, and that in itself is so overwhelming because I'm constantly getting the run-around, because it makes me so stressed to the point I'm in tears - it makes me not want to deal with it altogether, so I haven't since August. That's a big issue in my life rn. I started therapy in August and that's been going okay, I guess, but it's just a matter of time til they call me about my insurance, I'm sure. I don't know how to deal with this. I've never been taught how to deal w state insurance, not do I understand online what to do. It's hard for me to comprehend things lately as well.\nBesides that, my boyfriend and I are extremely low on money due to me not having a job. I haven't actively been looking for jobs because of my depression. It's so hard for me to want to wake up in the morning, to have the motivation to do things...if I start to do something, I lose motivation in the blink of an eye. Do you ever have the feeling where you're so sad, you're just numb? That's what I feel like all day every day, and even more that's just too hard to put into words.\nI just CAN'T go back to work where employers don't respect us, where you get harassed/berated at by customers all day for things you can't control, people who don't take the virus seriously and put you and others in danger, on top of global warming going to get at its worst in about 20 years. there's no REASON to work, I have no WILL to work or do ANYTHING. it's so fucking hard. I am an extremely emotional and sensitive person - the second a customer yells at me or starts shit with me is when I'm gonna have a breakdown. I'm constantly sad all day, I tend to forget things quickly, I have a low tolerance level for truly anything. I truly emotionally and mentally am not ready to go to back to work.

I was extremely distraught because I loved my father very much so when I heard that he had been put in hospice, I rushed over. 3 days after that, he died. He died a very peaceful death which made me happy but also sad that I would never be able to talk to him again.\n\nAt this time, I was also really invested in Clash of Clans and went to all sorts of irl events which involved the game. I had spent about $3,000 on the game and was extremely addicted. I have now quit the game because I do feel awful about how I had my priorities.\n\nBack to my father. After my father died, my 2 brothers and I set about to figure out the best time for the funeral for my father. We decided to have it on June 13, 2021 because that day worked for most of our family. We had made all of the preparations for the funeral and were now just waiting for the day to come. But while waiting, I got an announcement from my Clash of Clan's Clan. We were to do a meetup on the same day as the funeral and at the same time. I was extremely distraught about what to do because the Clan leader was coming to the meetup and I really wanted to go. But I also really wanted to go to my father's funeral, but I was also extremely depressed that my father had passed away and thought that going to the funeral would only make my depression worse. I also wanted to just take my mind off of my father because it was hurting a lot thinking about him. I was starting to drink way more than I used to and started becoming more aggressive. I then decided that I should go to the Clash of Clans in person meetup. I thought it was what I needed so I could put my mind off my father. Then the day came and I went to the Clash of Clans meetup but while there, my brother called me asking where I was and that the funeral had already started. That made me think of my father again and I started crying. I hung up immediately and asked the group if we could go to a bar. They were fine with it so we went to the nearest bar and I started drinking. And I drank a lot. I don't remember what all happened that night, but I heard in the morning that I went wild and started spilling all of my sorrows. Days after the funeral, my brother called me again and asked why I didn't go to the funeral. I explained that I went to the Clash of Clan's in person meetup instead and why I did what I did. He got extremely mad and even said that he might cut ties with me. I heard from my other brother that he might as well. I feel quite horrible that I missed my father's funeral now and have been stuck in my room as of late. I've quit Clash of Clan's for now and I don't know what I should do. I've been eating extremely unhealthy amounts of food and getting drunk everyday. I feel awful. I feel social media is the only place I can share this.

To have that painting shredded into pieces in just a single moment is something that I had never felt before 2020. And suddenly, I spent the next year-and-a-half of my life painting and repainting, painting and repainting.\n\nGraduating from college and moving into my first real place with my dog and boyfriend. Getting engaged and married surrounded by all our family and friends (and pets!). Having kids, and teaching them love and laughter.\n\nThat was the painting that I wanted, but it started fading and cracking.\n\nThe boyfriend/fiance/husband storyline was the first to go. Such an integral part of the white picket fence portrait I had painted. Someone who was meant to be my forever, someone who took a knife and cut himself out of the canvas when I wasn\u2019t looking. Tears in my eyes but head held high, I repainted a new future. One with an open spot for someone who wants and deserves it.\n\nThen came the family. Years ago, friends and family from abroad flew in, all preparing for my brother's wedding. There was chaos amongst the house at all times, as a house for three suddenly became a house for seven, sometimes even nine; grandparents from both sides, aunts and uncles, cousins. Utter chaos, but one that was centered around love and celebration. This May, my grandpa suffered a stroke and passed away a day before his birthday. I felt my future slipping from my grasp once more. My vision of a wedding like my brother's was gone. I would never have all of my family there for my wedding, and as my remaining grandparents get older, the realization that they might not be strong enough to travel halfway across the world to see me get married sets in. With sadness in my heart, I go back to the drawing board. More people to leave out of the painting.\n\nBut that's ok, I could still graduate and move into a real place with just me and my dog. I could still be surrounded by my friends and family. I could still get married and have kids. Not all was lost! But life is cruel. In October, our family dog collapsed. She couldn't control her bodily functions anymore and was so low energy she barely moved. Then they found it: a tumor in her spleen. \"It's aggressive,\" they said, \"we could perform surgery, but it would only extend her life by one to two months.\" And again, the sadness crept back in like fog. She was put down that Friday, two days after diagnosis. I watched as she put her head down and her body went limp. This creature, who I chose for our family to adopt, who I taught and trained, who was nothing but pure and loving, was gone. I could no longer take her with me after graduating because she was gone. Her ashes now sit next to where she used to sleep, and her memory sits in our hearts forever. With that, another rendition of the future had to be made, this painting a little less saturated; faces no longer so bright, youthful, and full of hope.\n\nMonths passed. Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years\u2019. I prayed that as 2020 came to a close, the bad news was over. And suddenly it was March. Things were getting back to normal, as the stress of classes and midterms took my mind off my grief. After a week of exams, I was at the finish line. Only two exams were standing between me and freedom now. Then I got a call. Something had happened to my friend, and all I knew was there was blood, lots of it, and it was an emergency. My heart was racing, and my mind went to the darkest theory: four years ago, I lost a friend to suicide, and I had an eerie feeling that this was the same horror. \"No, that's probably not right, he could have fallen in the shower and cut himself or hit his head,\" I tried to convince myself. \"There's no reason to worry.\" But that feeling I had was right. My friend was gone. I failed those two exams that day. I could feel myself drowning. Each time I finally caught a breath, a wave bigger than the last would push my head underwater, and I would go right back to struggling to break the surface. I felt mad, sad, and guilty all at once. How could I not have known how much he was struggling? Why did he have to do that instead of reaching out to us? Was I a bad friend? This friend, who was in my prom group, who I always considered happy and reliable, who was at the top of my invite list to every birthday party since I met him, was no longer with us. We couldn't go to Vegas or each others' weddings anymore. Slowly, I grabbed a new canvas, some darker paints, and repainted my future, and when I finished, I took a step back to look at the expressionless portrait faces that mirrored my own.\n\nBefore the metaphorical paint had even dried, I got another call. My mom was in the hospital with a dangerously high fever. She had been coughing for months now, caused by the abscess growth in her lungs. But what we didn't know was it wasn't just an abscess, it was a tumor. Her cancer had returned in a new location and with a vengeance. Within the next 10 weeks, we got nothing but more bad news. *It's incurable. She'll have to do chemo for the rest of her life. Surgery isn't effective anymore at this point.* After her first round of chemotherapy, her white blood cell count dropped steeply, allowing a lung infection to fester. And we were back to the hospital, where they confirmed that her tumors had grown and she was now reliant on only one of her lungs. Her five-year survival rate: 15%. How could I continue like nothing's wrong while my mom is in the next room, literally falling apart? How can I stay strong when it feels like nobody else understands what I am going through? How do I stay positive for my mom when on the inside all I feel is dread? And at this moment now, I truly feel alone. People go through breakups, family members passing, and I had friends to be with when my friend passed away. People have experienced those feelings before or alongside me. But nobody in my life has ever seen their mom struggle through stage 4 cancer. People don't understand I can't leave the house because there are responsibilities I need to see through. I have to work, help my dad with our family business, help take care of my mom, and get my mom's affairs in order. I barely have time to go out even if I had the energy, not to mention my mom's white blood cell count is still not up to par and she isn't vaccinated for COVID. I sit on my bathroom floor and cry late at night so nobody will hear me. This is my life now, this is how my life will be for a while, and I\u2019m exhausted.\n\nMy paintings are ruined. Trashed and set ablaze. With less and less family, friends, pets, and kids (because the world is cruel, as I've learned), why even bother painting when there is more empty space on the canvas than paint?

For the first time in a while I\u2019m not feeling utterly shit cuz of a girl we\u2019ll call SD. We used to go to school together and a few months ago started talking again. About two weeks ago she said she needed some time alone, and although it made anxiety go crazy I left her alone for a bit cuz I gotta respect her choices. Today she called me again cuz she wanted me to download a game we could play together. I answered the phone but instead of talking about the game she starts ranting to me about how she got played by a guy she liked and that she was sad. I for whatever reason still cared about her enough to listen and to hide how much bearing that hurt. After she hung up I broke down while trying to cook some food for my family. When my mum came downstairs she started getter angry at me cuz I hadn\u2019t finished the food and that\u2019s when I utterly lost it. I told her to fuck off and rand upstairs. She got even angrier and yelled that she is the only person that ever does something in this household. Because I\u2019m a complete moron and don\u2019t have control over what I\u2019m doing at this point I yell at her that I\u2019m gonna kill myself and just after almost go through with.

My mum was also bitching towards him and he believes that it\u2019s her fault I feel like this now but I can\u2019t get myself to tell him the actual reason. The icing on top of the shitcake is that I got really attached to SD really quickly and she was practically the reason I wasn\u2019t feeling like shit anymore.

I've stopped seeing friends and I've tried to stay alone as possible. I don't seem to have energy to be around or with people. I don't really know what I'm scared of.

This is the story of how i became a renowned stalker at school, had a noose around my neck and was threatened to be \"bashed in the head with a hammer\" for caring too much.\n\nEvery story has two sides and you can choose to believe mine or not that's fine. It all begins with a blossoming love (cringe).\nJust last year I started having feelings for a girl (for easier reference I'm going to call her S) in my class who I thought was pretty (simp). We started talking and one thing led to another. In a strange turn of events she started liking me back. Nothing ever happened of course but things took a turn for the worse. Her friends had started to message me one by one sporadically in intervals of a week or two telling me to 'Fuck Off ... STOP TALKING TO HER YOU CREEP' and the most extreme of them being \"Leave her alone or I'll beat your head in with a hammer\" . S tells me the complete opposite and encourages me to keep talking to her telling me things like \" Don't listen to my friends listen to me\" \" They're stupid listen to me\". I decided to make the biggest mistake of my life; listen to her. \n\nShe tells me stories of her being kicked out of the house at least once a week to sleep outside for being a waste of space and oxygen. S starts smoking and taking drugs with junkies at train stations. Me being the stupid person I am cared too much. I would try my best to help her and get shut down. With nights saying she'd kill herself. As any good person should do they should try to call to make sure that the person they care about hasn't committed suicide. So I call and call and call ... No response. I fell asleep that night crying and feeling hopeless. The next morning she carries on as if nothing has happened.\n\nA week later I get pulled into the wellbeing office at my school for stalker-like behaviour they say that my repeated calls and constant messages show that I've been acting like a stalker as a result my parents were contacted as well as finding out about my cutting habit and self loathing. My Year level coordinators and principal team find out about my behaviour and I get pulled out of class to have a private conversation. They give me two options, either stop texting her and do not go near her or continue being a stalker and risk expulsion.\nI blocked her and cried myself to sleep for nights in a row. I went into such a dark state where I had a noose around my neck ready to kill myself but i couldn't go through with it. Feeling people stare at me at school and whisper things is the worst. Losing the trust of everyone you've loved and cared about it shattering. Life just isn't  meant for someone like me.\nHere I am now, losing friends slowly. No one's there for me to vent to not even my family.\nEvery so often I get terrible shakes where I can't sleep because I think about this incident over and over.\n\nTLDR Girl breaks my heart convinces school im a stalker and I cry, a lot", "title": "Teenage Melodrama"}, {"created_utc": 1585923161, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/fu9423/_/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25"}, {"created_utc": 1585923111, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/fu93jg/i_dont_know_how_much_time_i_got_left/", "num_comments": 39, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I don't know how much time I got left \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25"}, {"created_utc": 1585922668, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/fu8z4z/haha_its_not_like_we_used_to_be_anything/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Haha.

My buddy Austin just called me up and said bro go download Tinder because that's a great app to help you get a girlfriend. So i told him I'd check it out..... The next day i boot up my phone and downloaded Tinder. Hello my name is Cody, I'm 19 and I'm a huge gamer/nerd and i love food as that is my passion i have a decent job at sales so maybe on my day off i can take you out. So i made my profile and uploaded some goofy pics of myself on there and it felt as a game swipping right and seeing how many likes you can get back, then i realized that I'm not that good at this game haha. Then came along Alyssa. She seemed cool she had a lot of friends that i had in common and also a lot of the same interests as me which i found amazing. I messaged her and asked if she wanted to go out and grab some mexican food and she seemed thrilled. Her picture showed a slender model like person so i was shocked that she said yes so i put on my best clothes, my best cologne that my mom got me and cleaned my car to try and make a good impression on her, little did i know what i had in store for me. I arrived at her house and was a little discouraged to see that she didn't look exactly as she did in the pictures. She was a little more on the heavier side which didn't bother me but just thought it was strange that she thought that she had to lie to find someone. After having a nice first date we thought it would be a good idea to keep seeing each other so we did. Eventually we labeled each other as boyfriend and girlfriend, i even helped her get a job at the same store i worked in and life felt great. Well after a while it started to go sour and things didn't vibe like it use to so we broke up as well. I thought to avoid the toxic workspace i left to go to work at a cvs as overnight cashier. Life started to get back to normal, i got over her and moved on but then late overnight i had a call around 2/3 am, a woman asking to speak to me once i told her it was me she said it was alyssa and she was pregnant. My life as i knew it would change, we went and looked at cribs toys and clothes for the new baby. I was getting so excited and happy that i have brought a new life into this wonderful world. She eventually told me that she didnt need my help anymore taking her to appointments or help getting stuff that she would ask for help if she needs it. I tried to stay in contact in case she needed help, a couple weeks later she told me she did a pre natal paternity test and found out that i wasnt the father and i was devastated ... \n\nEnd of chapter 2\nThe lonely father", "title": "Chapter 2 I'm Devastated..."}, {"created_utc": 1585842969, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/ftosgi/suicide/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "Someone I was trying to help, deleted his account and now I\u2019m scared shitless.

Right now my wife and I have her body and her memory sitting next to us like she's sleeping, but I know no matter how much we cry and beg she will not open her eyes anymore. Even though many people are going through a rough time please don't forget about our most loyal companions. Animals that we don't deserve, but love us unconditionally...

I\u2019ve been trying to see otherwise but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I have a toxic relationship with my mother. This time she just put the icing on the cake. She moved my troubled younger sister into my apartment that I share with my cousin while I was away in another state. I said I\u2019d take her in because she basically guilt tripped me into it. Before she could plans changed and I talked to her and told her that it was a bit of a relief because it would\u2019ve been such a huge responsibility. Then a few weeks later she calls me and tells me that she\u2019s going to be at my apartment and if I had any \u201cquestions or concerns\u201d I could talk to her. LIKE WTF ITS MY APARTMENT! I was furious but I ranted to my boyfriend and moved on. I normally check my power bill because it\u2019s a habit and one of my only bills I pay and I saw that it was $8 one day and on average it\u2019s $3 between my roommate and I. So that\u2019s a huge difference. My cousin ended up calling me later that day and I bought it up to him and he informed me that she\u2019d went home. I thought to myself that if she\u2019s home then there\u2019s no problem, it\u2019ll just even out so that\u2019s not a big deal. A few days later my mom calls me basically fussing at me like a child about how I don\u2019t care about my sister and $8 means more to me than her and if I had a problem with it then I should\u2019ve come to her and that she could\u2019ve been at my house and I wouldn\u2019t even know about it. I was completely caught off guard and hurt but I wasn\u2019t upset with my cousin, my mom has a way of hearing things. It\u2019s like her mind twists and bends things til she hears what she wants to hear and she reacts off of that. I didn\u2019t talk to her for four days and she called me to fuss at me. I felt like a little kid again. When I was younger and she fussed I was only allowed to listen because if I said anything back it was seen as \u201cdisrespect\u201d or me not staying in a child\u2019s place. So I just kinda shut down. I see myself react that way when my boyfriend and I have issues or even when I had a situations with my old boss. A few days after that she calls me acting like nothing ever happened so I bring up the situation and ofc what she feels stays the same because she\u2019s always right. Later I get a text.\n\nMama: Just so you know ...\nI understand what you\u2019re trying to articulate. It\u2019s your place &amp; for me to think I have any say is perhaps disrespectful. Okay! I would have rather heard any complaint(s) from you directly knowing that you called me and knowing that you\u2019re safe and well- even if it was to complain. You don\u2019t know how to balance having a relationship and still communicate effectively with your FAMILY who was there before your relationship. I find it offensive and very immature on your part. Nonetheless, that is who you are and Sam is your primary focus. And Monica is where she is right now (when she could be at your apt unbeknownst to you) bc of our previous conversation regarding this matter. I will totally respect your boundary of not wanting her at your apt. Gn. Sleep &amp; rest well. Love you &amp; it was good hearing your voice. \n\nMe: I don\u2019t know if you are but it seems like you\u2019re blaming me for where she is because I didn\u2019t want her at my apartment. Maybe it\u2019s not but that\u2019s just what it seems. And maybe I haven\u2019t fully figured out how to balance my relationship and my family but  it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t try. I talk to the kids almost every other day. Again with the light bill situation, it wasn\u2019t a big deal to me and I don\u2019t think that I made it that way. \n\nMama: I am absolutely not blaming you. \nShe is exactly where she needs to be rather than with Andrew having fun. When the message was relayed to me it seemed like a BIG deal until he told you she wasn\u2019t there anymore. \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t want a relationship with her anymore. She doesn\u2019t respect me and I don\u2019t like how she treats me. I turned 20 last month. I keep contemplating cutting her off but I feel like it\u2019s too early in my life. I need her but I\u2019m sick of the bullshit. This entire situation is completely stupid. But things like this happen at least once a month. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t ever live a peaceful life because she\u2019s literally my only source of drama. I don\u2019t know what I should do. I wanna talk to her but she\u2019ll just act like she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, tell all of my family members and make herself out to be the victim.", "title": "Should I cut my mother off?"}, {"created_utc": 1587537458, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/g5w62u/i_do_everything_im_asked_and_i_still_somehow_am/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "am i a fucking slave to my parents? ok i get it im their child like i do obey them and everything but does it look like i have 8 arms that can do everything im asked holy shit. i complain obviously cuz its so much to handle and them still shouting at me just makes it worse. i get asked to do something and i do exactly what they say and they still find a reason to say i did it wrong? how is that even fucking possible. dont they see that they treat me like shit? but they treat every other fucking child they meet better than their own daughter. i tried so hard to be a good daughter. i dont smoke. i dont vape. i have good grades. i save my money and even give it to them. i barely go out. i do chores. wtaf do they want from me.", "title": "i do everything im asked and i still somehow am the bad one"}, {"created_utc": 1587535721, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/g5vu0a/_/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi.

He lived in America and I live in Ireland so time zones kinda wanky. I would always stay up at night to talk to him. We were friends for quite a long time. I trusted him completing and never lied to him. Irl I am very not trusting of people because of all the pain suffered in my life. My parents being awful and being bullied at a very young age of 6 i had no confidence or self-esteem of myself. I hated myself and still do. I won't share too much of what he told me but his family was very shitty to him. If i could i would have let him stay with me but since we were online friends i felt useless since i couldn't do anything to help G. I trusted him with my heart and truly loved him. I don't use the word love often but he was one of the people that i truly loved and trusted and still do. Back then i didn't realise i loved him because all i wanted for was him to be happy. One time he didn't reply to me much I didn't think much of it since he probably was either sleeping or just very busy. Months go by and no reply but then one day suddenly he replied and that was then when he told he tried to end his life. I remember feeling so useless i wish i could have done something for him. I don't blame him i understand how he felt back then now. He had depression and attempted to take his life a few times already. After that nothing, much happened except that he moved away from home and had a part-time job. That was the last i head of him since my account got deleted and i couldn't contact him any more because that was the only way we contacted each other. I remember crying and feeling dead inside he was the person i depended on and loved. I also felt guilty because now he doesnt know what happened and why had my account disappeared. Present time i currently suffering through depression and many other things which i understand him much better. Though i also realised that i loved, adored and admired him. He was a great person that supported me and just was wonderful. I wish i did much more for him. I still have these feeling because i have only realised these feelings can be warm but yet so suffocating. I still love him. I hope one day I'll be able to contact or even meet him.\n\nI wanted to share my story to just show that sadly not everything has a happy ending I am still suffering from depression and many other things.

We would build, have fun, go to servers and hang out with other friends. Four years later we had gotten close, last year he asked me out, I was ecstatic. But I also knew things would not turn out well in the end and I had doubts, I would tell him things, and he would reassure me that none of those things would happen. Summer comes along, lots of arguments would happen between us and we grew apart. We broke up due to a lot of issues, mainly because I had doubts about myself and I couldn\u2019t give him what he deserved. The only thing he would want back is love, affection, care, yet I failed to give him those things. Months pass by, he would come and go, he came back and there\u2019s this girl who asked him out. She started playing with us and I eventually told him I figured out who she was by profiles and chats. He got upset, but told me not to tell her, he says that he misses me and I miss him so much more than anything. He still knows how to make me laugh and feel emotions that I used to believe were love. I want to tell him that I love him, that he\u2019s the only one in my life I could see myself with. Yet he always says he will die alone and as a virgin. But I want to build a friendship with him, yet I get jealous and upset whenever the other girl is around. I want him to be happy with new people in his life, and I also want to keep a distance so he doesn\u2019t have to worry that it affects my life. He blamed himself for all the problems, but I\u2019m also at fault because he told his friends that I was interested with some other guy.

Even though I talked to our mutual friend if it would be alright for me to pursue her former crush, she supported me and gave me her best wishes. However my two (now former) friends told me to not believe what she said since it\u2019ll hurt her ego. So when our mutual friend came up to me about her problems, she opened up on how she was disappointed in me for not telling her about how I could possibly like her former crush sooner and later on, mentioned my former friend\u2019s name in disappointment. I took that as an opportunity to ask her if what they said about her was true (since I really didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings and wanted to really make sure). I did tell her beforehand that I didn\u2019t mention them and what they said out of spite or whatsoever, I just wanted to know if that\u2019s how she would feel (since they knew her so well as much I did). I realized that what I said hurt her and I kinda regretted saying it (even if I didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone).\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I did realize the gravity of my words once I said it, so I did say sorry. I know people might say that I should\u2019ve just trusted her, and you all have a valid point. I could\u2019ve just let them say what they wanted to say and just trust her word. But I didn\u2019t, because of the fact that I was worried that what they said might\u2019ve been how she really felt. I know maybe telling her wasn\u2019t really the optimal choice, but at the moment, I felt like I wanted to be honest and know where everybody stood in the situation, most especially my friend\u2019s feelings towards her former crush. \n\nEventually, I told one of my former friends about me telling our mutual friend about what they said since I wanted to reaffirm them that our mutual friend is okay with it and that what they said about her ego and feelings won\u2019t get hurt. However, it became some misunderstanding that apparently, I wanted to cause drama wherein they thought that I wanted our mutual friend to confront them about they said about her and her ego (TAKE NOTE: these ex-friends of mine REALLY value our mutual friend\u2019s judgment on them... It\u2019s always been like this since high school... unhealthy I know). \n\nEx-friend 1 and I talked, and I said sorry for everything that might\u2019ve offended them and we were okay (but things changed when ex-friend 1 talked to ex-friend 2). \n\nApparently ex-friend 2 asked for info from our mutual friend about our conversation beforehand, and because our mutual friend can be neutral, she said things in a \u201cas-a-matter-of-fact way\u201d (she left out personal stuff she told me since mutual friend said so herself that she trusts me more than she trusts ex-friend 2). And because of what she said and how much she left out, ex-friend 2 thought I lied about my intentions, that I said what they told me so that I can apparently get our mutual friend to look at them in a bad light or as the \u201cbad guys\u201d. Which was never even my intention in the first place!\n\nBasically both of my former friends were talking and thinking that I conspired for our mutual friend to basically hate them. And I\u2019m really hurt and so frustrated by it. We\u2019re growing up, we\u2019re no longer in high school... yet why does it feel like we never left? \n\nI know I\u2019m not perfect, and I know that I could\u2019ve just kept quiet. Maybe some things are truly better off unsaid. Yet at the time, I really wanted to be an honest person, with no spite towards anyone. It just hurts me how the people I thought who knew me the most, can see me as someone I\u2019m not.\n\nThis hasn\u2019t been the first time they misunderstood me and my actions, and heck, maybe this was a sign that they\u2019re toxic friends? I just felt like I gave so much love to them, didn\u2019t get mad at them for misunderstanding me and gave them the benefit of the doubt for many times already, yet only for them to take it for granted when they wanted to. \n\nNow both of them have not talked to me, they unfollowed me and I just decided to deactivate since this problem + more personal stuff have been really affecting my mental health. As for my mutual friend, I know she technically didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but I decided that maybe it\u2019s best if I just didn\u2019t talk to her too (I will talk to her again eventually) to avoid further misunderstandings. I know it\u2019s unfair that I\u2019m probably not talking to her, I feel bad about it too, but I feel like if I\u2019m not comfortable talking to her, knowing that she\u2019s talking to them... Idk I might suddenly say something that could cause an issue unintentionally (TAKE NOTE 2: me and my mutual friend also had a big falling out in high school, but we slowly repaired that since the beginning of college almost 2 years ago. I started to trust her again recently but this issue is making me feel like I can\u2019t trust anyone).\n\nIf you read this far, THANK YOU. I just really wanted to get this off my chest.

I know most of you won\u2019t want to read this much but if you\u2019ve got nothing better to do I say stick around. For those who do want to stick around let me warn you.. this isn\u2019t the happy story that everyone wants to hear. So let\u2019s begin...\n\nOnce upon a time there live a girl named Lila. She was an ordinary girl with an ordinary life. She went to school. Came home. Atended practices. Did some homework. Ate. Slept. And repeated the process all over again. Her life may have seemed boring but it was pretty nice to her. It was normal. One day.. while attending her practice her instructor told the entire group together because they\u2019d be doing a group building activity. She was quite excited.. little did she know her life was going to completely change. So she hears the instructor call out \u201ceverybody partner up, but make sure to partner up with someone you haven\u2019t talked to before\u201d. She got even more excited so she could meet the first years but unfortunately she was almost the last to have a partner. She then kept searching and heard her name being called out. It was a boy.. a second year. His name was Liam. Now Liam... was very attractive but Lila didn\u2019t think much of it. Everyone started the team building game and the day went on. Lila thought about that day for quite sometime but then soon forgot about it. Some days went by and then it was finally close to the end of July. The best time of summer. Lila\u2019s city held a community picnic for the entire city and most people would attend. Lila went hoping to get to hang with some friends but unfortunately none of her friends were coming that day. Some time went one and she found some kids from her team and decided to hang with them. They were walking around talking when they ran into Liam and his friends. They decided to talk and Lila asked Liam\u2019s friend if they could hangout because she was better aquatinted with her. She agreed and Lila, Liam And Liam\u2019s friend Natalie all hung out. Natalie wasn\u2019t all too welcoming but they still hung. Then Natalie got a text from a friend asking if she wanted to come pick him up so they could chill and Natalie agreed. Natalie left and now it was just Liam and Lila. They hung out the rest of the night and it was like a fairy tale. They soon fell in love and decided to talk as something more than friends. As time rolled around they fell deeper and deeper in love. Attended school dances together and Lila even felt as if he was the one. Her first love and deep down she was hoping he was her last. As time passed, however, things started changing. Liam started changing. He quit trying so much and kept trying to just break things off. Lila noticed but pretended everything was alright. Until.. it wasn\u2019t. The day of homecoming everything went well and they danced the night away. They were both happy.. at least that\u2019s what it seemed like. That night... Liam texted Lila that he wasn\u2019t so sure about them anymore. He didn\u2019t think it would work out. Lila reassured him and the subject ended there and then. Then a few weeks later the same subject popped up but this time it really happened. Liam told Lila that it wasn\u2019t working and Lila ask him why. He said they would be better off as friends. And so she agreed. For the sake of his happiness she agreed. However, deep down she knew it was because she hadn\u2019t gotten physically close to Liam. Liam wanted more than just dancing. Lila hadn\u2019t even kissed Liam yet but she was waiting for the right moment to do so. However, Liam wasn\u2019t ok with that. So that day... things ended for good. Lila didn\u2019t take this so well and almost tried to just end it all that day. However, before she could take that step she received a phone call. It was her best friend. She was just calling to ask how she was and Lila explained the whole situation. Lila\u2019s friend Maria picked her up and helped her calm down. Time passed and Lila seemed to be doing ok. She decided to stay friends with her ex and not make anything awkward. As time went on she found another guy and started liking him. One day she decided to hangout with her friend Cleo and Natalie. She also decided to invite Liam since him and Natalie were close. They hung out and everything seemed fine. However, as more time went on and she tried to be friendly with Liam, he just got fed up and started ignoring her. She knew why and she realized that she should just quit. So she forgot him and kept moving on. She started falling in love with an amazing guy.... Jake. They talked everyday and she told her Cleo, Natalie and Liam about him. Why\u2019s she tell Liam? Well she didn\u2019t.. he was just in a GC with her other 2 friends and she didn\u2019t really care for him so she said it anyways. Did she do it to make him jealous? No. She just moved on and didn\u2019t care about what he thought. She texted them in her little group chat about the fun things they do, and how she was ready to take it to the next level. She realized she was mature enough to kiss someone. This may not seem like a big deal but it was for Lila. She had been saving her first kiss for someone who she could trust. Time went on and Lila\u2019s friend Cleo had joined a swim team. And to cheer her on she decided to ask Natalie to come with her to one of the meets to cheer her on. Natalie agreed and brought Liam along. However, that night. Liam seemed more friendly. He sat next to Lila and kept trying to have a conversation with her. After the meet they decided to have dinner and Liam sat next to her. Now Lila knee something was off and asked Natalie about it. Natalie told her that she noticed it too and so lol just didn\u2019t think anything of it after that. Later that night she received a text. It was from Liam. He was trying to just text and see what Lila was up to. Lila knee something was fishy so she directly asked Liam what he wanted and he told her he was sorry and that he wanted to get back together with him. Lila was hesitant because she was already falling for another guy but after weeks and weeks of sweet words she complied and gave him a second chance. They hung out more now and Lila and Liam finally kissed. She trusted him so much this time that she thought that he really was the one. He came back so he really did still care for her and she loved him. Huh.. so she thought. Once again.. everything was going fine for a couple months. They attended a school dance again and once again that night something went wrong. Liam noticed Lila\u2019s other friends who was pregnant at the time. He kept staring at her and so Lila asked what he was looking at. Lila looked back and noticed WHO he was staring at. He was starting at her pregnant friend. She didn\u2019t say anything but then heard Liam say \u201cpregnant people are so hot\u201d Lila got a upset from that comment but Liam apologized and once again she forgave him. Throughout the entire night she noticed he kept staring at her and so she got mad at him, and they had a fight. He told her that he was just joking and that she had not reason to get upset with him. Lila thought he was right and decided to apologize. After that they didn\u2019t really talk about that incident. However, Liam started changing again. One time he brought up religion and told Lila that she and their kids would go to hell if they didn\u2019t believe in Christ (not shaming Christians. Just explaining what happened in the story), so she stopped talking about her religion. He told her that she clapped weird so she stopped clapping. He also told her that she laughs weird, so she stopped laughing. Slow by slow she lost herself. She became anxious and depressed. She was lost and felt alone. At one point throughout this hell she was so anxious she couldn\u2019t even touch her phone because she was scared that he texted her saying he didn\u2019t like this or that about her..... and yet... she still believed he was the one. She thought he\u2019d come back like he did the other times. She kept changing herself and even gave up some friends because he said he didn\u2019t like them. She gave everything up and yet it wasn\u2019t enough. On May 13th Liam was dropping Lila off and told Lila once again that he beloved they should break up. He thought it was for the best. She begged him not to do this again and he wouldn\u2019t listen. He wouldn\u2019t let her talk. He kept trying to get out of the situation and trying to avoid the subject. He never gave her closure. He just kept saying it wouldn\u2019t work out. They weren\u2019t meant to be. That day.. she realized all that she lost. She lost her friends, her laughter, her smile, her happiness, her family, everything. She gave up so much only to be left again. She was the stupid one. Months went by and it\u2019s almost been a year. She\u2019s doing better now. Lila has grown into a stronger, more independent woman. She smiles again... she\u2019s doing better. However, every now and then she gets a pain in her heart. Not because she misses him. But because she feels so stupid for letting him have that much control over her. She feels stupid for trusting someone so much. She feels hurt and doesn\u2019t know what to do. At night... when she\u2019s in bed crying. She has all her friends but still feels alone and lost. She knows that she\u2019s not in love with him, but she still hurts. She still feels alone. She cries at night and when she begs for god to help her she doesn\u2019t know what to do. She wants to ask for help... but from who? She has all these friends and still feels alone.. who should she ask help from? Why does she feel this way? Is this normal? Why is this happening to her? These are the questions that keep her up at night.\n\n\nHowever... this is just a story.. my humblest apologizes for any typos or anything wrong with this story. Another thing I\u2019d like to clarify is the religion part. I\u2019m not bashing on any religion. That part was just pertinent to the story. Thank you for listening.

My SO and I have been together for almost 3years and have been living together over 2. He\u2019s my world but sometimes I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m his. I do my best to try to do things even in quarantine. I try my best to make him meals and desserts and show him love and be there for him. But I\u2019ve been getting bad again. It\u2019s my fault. I stopped taking my meds for a while because I was feeling good. Then I crashed and I\u2019m back on the cycle my dumb ass. (Take ya pills). I have phone sessions with my therapist every few weeks and If I need her she said to call or text but I don\u2019t want to burden her and I don\u2019t have the extra money to talk to her. Even though when we talk it\u2019s never about me being sad it\u2019s about what I\u2019m doing and how I\u2019m taking care of myself. I lie. I\u2019m a compulsive liar, and a pretty good one. (Not proud of that). But lying is a defense mode. And it\u2019s kept me out of the damn hospital. I don\u2019t harm myself. Though I think about it. How it would feel. Would I feel in control of myself for once? But my SO would notice. I stopped wearing rubber bands on my hands because I would pull the band snap it until welts appeared just because I had to fidget, feel something. I tried to be sexy I showered shaved, put on his favorite lingerie and walked into our living room where he was gaming with friends. He just looked at me and said \u201cbabe I\u2019m gaming\u201d I\u2019m not that unattractive- at least I don\u2019t think. I have hips and and ass and boobs but also a tummy and stretch marks (you know how it be if you\u2019re a little bigger) I just sat there and stared at him. Waiting for a match to end and him to say \u201chey boys I gotta go take care of some things\u201d but instead he kept playing and I eventually just put my pajamas on. I asked him if he loved me and he said \u201cof course If this is about me going to bed and you staying up late it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t love you it\u2019s because I need a normal sleep schedule.\u201d Yeah. Sleeping at the same time must be what\u2019s bothering me of course. getting rejected multiple times because he\u2019s tired or gaming is starting to hurt me. I\u2019m already sad and depressed and the one person who Idolized and praised me no longer exists. He\u2019s entangled in video games with the boys. I wonder if it would hurt him if he knew how I felt. I do my best to always please and take care of him and I don\u2019t feel loved or taken care of in return and it hurts me. I know this is the anxiety and depression talking. I know he loves me and wants me but it\u2019s hard when insomnia and my thoughts kick in and I lie here awake at night. He lets me sleep all day because he knows I struggle to sleep at night. Plus when I\u2019m sleeping he gets to game as much as he wants with no requests to do something. Today I went out long boarding with my dog, he didn\u2019t come. He gamed. It felt good to get fresh air and to let my girl run while I sailed along. I didn\u2019t want to stop or go home but she was tired and I had dishes calling my name. He never asked me how it was, or how our dog did first time with a longboard. He just looked up from his game and said hey. I know he\u2019s bored. Quarantine is boring. But am I also that boring? Is taking the time to explore your girlfriends body boring ? I just feel fucked up. He can\u2019t know I feel this, because this would shatter him. He is a good man, but damn take a hint. I need him to show me love and need me. Idk I\u2019m sorry for ranting and errors. But I need somewhere to vent where people I know can\u2019t find it. So here I am.

Not only was she quite knowledgable, she had an amazing personality, always smiley, and kept me afloat. There were times that I sank deep into my depression pit and found times that I needed her to help me out. \n\nI still returned the favor though, I tried everything in my power to treat her right, to never get upset with her, and to just get to know more about her. I thought everything was going great, then just one day she stopped responding. Two days before our 1 year, she cut it off. I was quite confused, as I felt things were going well. I didn't push any boundaries asking why, as I felt it was a lost cause and obviously she didn't think we were meant to work out. She then moved to Germany a year later (she was on a trip to Germany when she broke up with me), and the first day she arrived she posted a picture kissing another guy... A guy that I asked her about -- roughly two weeks before she broke up with me.\n\nThis absolutely destroyed my heart, as the person I really wanted to keep as endgame ended up finding a 'more suitable' guy, but couldn't say anything to me about it. I tried to go for a 'rebound' (I put quotes because physically she was quite more attractive, and honestly had almost of good of a personality). Things went well with that for roughly a month.\n\nAll of a sudden-- no replies. I message her about once every other day, asking if everything was okay. Finally after about 8 days I ended up telling her things aren't going to work out with no communication, then she finally replies with she's fine, her battery went to shit, and agrees we shouldn't be together.\n\nAt this point I didn't want to ever try for a girl again, and I found out through Instagram she was fucking her ex DURING the month we dated.\n\nAndddd yeah, almost 2.5 years later, I am still single and not really making any moves, so fuck those two people.

Non of my outside relatives remembered except my grandpa. \u201cWell that\u2019s good enough for me\u201d , that\u2019s what I said to myself to continue with my day. I did some chores and played some online games and it made feel better. Then my doorbell rang. I walked up to answer it, and i saw that my aunt, my uncle, three of my cousins, and grandma. I was a bit excited because they brought a chocolate cake (which is my favorite), and candies. As I about to say \u201cthanks for remembering my\u201d. \n\nUncle: \u201cOh hi Kat( not my real name ), Sorry for dropping in. We just need a place to celebrate your cousin birthday\u201d.\n\nAunt: \u201cYeah kat, We where in Mexico during his birthday but couldn\u2019t celebrate. As we where passing by.

Except my cousin  is severely autistic and couldn\u2019t understand it and i don\u2019t want him to feel bad or make it worse for him, since his parents prefer to go to Mexico instead of celebrating his actual birthday. So I allowed them to celebrate at my day of my birth. Grandma told me to take the birthday cake to the dinner table and she also forgotten about my birthday. \n\nI pulled my older cousin a side and explained what today is. She said that she felt bad but I told her to ignore it since it\u2019s her brother. At least she said happy birthday to me. So we all came to the dining room and cheered happy birthday to him. I went outside just to be myself for a bit. When I came back inside. They all were in a hurry to leave. I said my fair well to them and they left. I asked my sister what happened.

This is my first post ever and I've been feeling a little down lately : (\n\nSo let's start w/ some background info. Im a 17 yrs old fob who came from Hong Kong. I immigrated to the U.S in 8th grade. I have a good amount of friends at high school. Some of them I only talk to in class and there are 6 ppl that im closest w/. I get along w/ these people at school pretty well and we eat lunch together. Other than seeing them at school, we also have a messenger group chat where we'll share memes and talk abt random things almost everyday. Before quarantine, I had gone out w/ these ppl many times like going to the mall, volunteering at Petsmart, eating dinner, and playing video games at a friend's house. But at the beginning of this year, I noticed something has changed. They started to hangout w/o me (I think last time they went bowling) and I found out that when they talked abt how much fun they had in front of me during lunch. I sometimes questioned myself what I did wrong but I just couldn't figure it out. I treat them very nicely and for sure I know none of them hates me or anything. In this friends group, Ardee and I are they only ones who can drive and I've given these ppl so many free rides b4 cuz I consider them as friends. Few days ago, Ardee baked some cookies and delivered them to everyone's house but me. I wasn't mad cuz I knew that i live kinda far from them (they live in the same city) and that it would be a waste of gas for him to drive to my house. Yesterday was the big day - graduation, a day that's supposed to be memorable and fun, however, it was completely ruined because they didn't invite me to take pictures with them. I asked in the group chat if they wanted to meet up and take grad photos and they just ignored my question as if they had not yet taken it and talked about smth else. Afterward I went on ig and saw one of them posted their grad photos w/ everyone tagged except me, and I was in my room left out and crying, almost to the point of committing suicide. I didn't really care that they didn't invite me to go bowling nor deliver cookies to my house. But this time it hurts like hell. I've been waiting for years for this day to come. It's not like I need someone to pick me up to take the photos. They all know I have a car I can go anywhere at anytime, yet no one ever invited me. Grad photo means a lot to me and my heart is completely broken with this surprise, in addition to graduation being cancelled.\n\nFew months ago I got rejected by a girl.

He supports me just because my mother said so. When the time my younger brother became part of the same club, it was different. He got supported without asking anything. I was jealous.

My parents have other plans, they want an accountant as their child. They want me to take accountancy on some other school that I don't like. They did not give me choices unlike my older brothers and my younger brother. But I failed the entrance exam for accountancy, they made me choose financial management so that I can shift to accountancy for the next semester which I never did because I did not want to. \n\nI was a freshman in college, 16 years old that time. When my brothers went away without saying anything. They left me all the responsibility. Only I and my younger brother was left with our parents. My parents took their anger out on me. They blamed me for everything. They felt sad and angry at the same time whenever they see me. \n\nYears passed, I continued trying to make them happy. But I guess I am still not enough. My older brother came home, my family was happy again. I am happy that they are safe and alive, but it breaks my heart seeing how happy they are.

Before I go into it, yes I understand I\u2019m a shallow asshole. Yes I understand that I lost the best thing for me and I deserve it. Yes I understand that she deserves better than me. But I can\u2019t tell anyone in my life this, so why not post as an anonymous stranger on reddit?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I met my ex girlfriend over a year ago. When I met her, I didn\u2019t really see myself being into her. She was overweight, had braces, and didn\u2019t really have a butt. I\u2019m being as honest as I can and not trying to sugarcoat things. I\u2019m a 20M. She\u2019s a 19F. We both go to the same college. Anyways, we hit it off and became really good friends. She became my best friend. A little while later, she told me she had feelings for me. When she said that, I thought I had feelings for her too, because I\u2019d been on reddit long enough to know I shouldn\u2019t be so shallow and judge mental and her personality is what mattered. I subconsciously lied to mysef that I felt the same way, and I told her I did. We started dating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, she\u2019s an amazing person, absolutely amazing person. I love everything about her. We make each other laugh. The only thing I didn\u2019t really love was physical appearance, but I tried to ignore that. After all, I\u2019ll grow to love all of her, or that\u2019s what I thought. However, I didn\u2019t. Time went on and I started getting more angry and frustrated at myself till I realized I truly was a shallow asshole and looks did matter to me. She told me she loved me every opportunity she got and I found it hard to say the same thing back. I could tell I was everything to her, and at that point, i felt more detached than ever. I ended it after six months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was completely honest with her in the most caring way possible. I wanted to be there for her and care for her but I just wasn\u2019t as physically attracted to her as I thought I was. I thought I owed her at least some semblance of truth rather than bs her and say, \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d. I didn't want to waste her time or keep her from finding someone who could truly love all of her. There was no one else, I just felt really guilty. She was heartbroken for a long while. Things got awkward. The quarantine sort of saved that because she had to go home to another state and so did I. I thought to myself the next time we saw, she would have moved on and things wouldn\u2019t be so awkward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, fast forward to now and she looks like a completely different person. She apparently was so hurt by me breaking up with her that she took the motivation to diet, go to the gym and improve her overall health. She also got her braces off and changed her entire wardrobe. We talk now as friends, but then I look at her snap stories and I just start to feel terrible. She looked like a completely different person. The one thing that stopped me from completely loving her was  gone now, but so was she. Everything else was literally perfect. Then she took the motivation to become even more perfect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, I know I deserve this and I\u2019m shallow. I know she\u2019ll find someone better that\u2019ll appreciate all of her, I just wanted to post my emotions somewhere. I feel really terrible now.

She showed me a \"documentary\" that the person speaking claimed to be a doctor, without showing his face or any type of evidence that he was actually a doctor, I saw five minutes of the video and it was pure lies, ridiculously easy to verify; One of the narrator's comments was that there were no cases of unvaccinated children that have created an epidemic .... I think I use the word pandemic, I'm not sure, since a pandemic is used for bigger cases i guess, but that is not what matters, many of us already know about the measles cases in the USA that resurfaced because of the anti vaxxers, but the \"doctor\" did not say this in the documentary, so long story short, we ended up fighting, because I told her how stupid she sounded.\n\nI tell you this story because I have four older sisters, one, as I said is anti vaxxer, another is a flat earther creationist (I also tell you this with great embarrassment) and the rest of my family is super religious, so how can I not feel lonely?

He\u2019s told me crazy stories about all the fun, adventurous things him and his mates got up to.\n\n(I\u2019ll make my point after this paragraph) I was watching a YouTuber review a movie and he told this story about how every week when he was younger, he\u2019d go to the video store with his friends and buy a bunch of movies.

And it\u2019s not about those specific things, I\u2019m not looking for an illegal rave to go to or a street race, I\u2019m just looking for anything.\n\nSo my question is, is it me or is there really just less adventure and less fun now? Does society really just do less now than we used to? Is this because of better police equipment, the internet, people being unhealthy, the media, social media? Why are things so dull now? Why don\u2019t people do things anymore?\n\nSorry for the rambling, the bad wording of things, my punctuation probably, this is my first reddit post be nice please", "title": "People don\u2019t do things anymore.

Early on I was struggling with college and greatly depressed. I had to move back to my parents.  Things were a little better with but I felt like I was regressing.\n\nA year later I moved to the city and while socially I felt like I was coming into my own I still couldn't rap my head around my school work and managed to take, drop, withdraw and retroactively withdraw from multiple years worth of failed classes.fortunatelt I had supportive parents trying to help me, but at the time I was too immature to really get it, and threw all that away. Had my first serious relationship while still floundering at school and when I had to move away and she did too she started seeing someone else and ended things in a way that stuck with me pretty bad.\n\nNow back at my parents again I try yet another attempt at college rebound into a really bad short lived online relationship with someone I eventually learned was  6 years younger than me and thank God  she was smart enough to block me completely, because even though nothing inappropriate had happened my retarded ass didn't realize how bad a situation I'd put myself in.\n\nAfter failing out of my classes yet again and failing to find work I was kicked out of my home and started living part time on friends couches, and part time out of my car staying in parking lots til security would come harass me. Made a friend a few cities over from where I'd been staying and would visit her a lot. She was someone I admired and wanted to live more like since my life was such a train wreck at the time. When she went to university I drove cross state to see her. The details of all of this are foggy in my head at best now but I feel like in retrospect it's hard to see myself as anything more that a really awkward stalker. We were legitimately friends once, I think I very well killed that forever.\n\nA little time longer passed I was applying for jobs in 4 different cities started taking more community college classes too.a couple classes I had to drop due to the constant panic attacks they caused me, a class on sexuality, and a different one on gender. Started to have a lot of concerns about who I even was. Buried those feelings deep and continued on. \n\nAt this point I had on a whim applied to another university I wanted to go to, got rejected, portioned to get accepted, got in, and then immediately decided against it and went back to job hunting. One city I wasn't planning to apply for work in I happened to be into visit a friend who I had met that summer and had some complicated feelings for her. Anyway I decided to drop off a couple apps while I was there and immediately got call backs.\n\nSo I moved to the new city. Lost the job I got. Spent some time job hunting. Lost the next job I hot., Before finally landing on a job that lasted a whole year.in that time I had made friends with my new friend's friends had a really great time with them and then one day a drunk me in a chat said I think [first friend's name] is the one. One day later the whole group called me to meet for drinks only to make it an intervention where they cut me out of all future plans.\n\nSpent most of the next year alone, finally got connected with a worked across the street who knew me from cons who introduced me to her friends and all of that was fucking great. Until it wasn't. financially I was struggling as I left my last job and needed a new one quick. I was perpetually anxious (which btw i suffer from gad and panic attacks I'd learned by now)started a new job that one of my friends got for me, had increasingly bad panic attacks surrounding it and quit which made things pretty uncomfortable. Then I started divivd my time between people and trying to spend more time with my female friends as at this point I was coming to realize I just really wanted to be one of the girls. Of course I had no idea how to explain that and got standoffish and completely buried the hatchet on quite a few more friendships I cared about.\n\nAt another all time low, the friend who I had claimed was the one (we were on okay terms again just a bit uncomfortable at that time) helped me line up a therapist while my session there didn't last long it lead me to discovering that I had severely impactive adhd issues so I pursued getting that fixed.thanks to the wonders of medical care in California, too me like 6 months to see anyonr who could prescribe for it. Between that and an on site counselor helping me to organize better. I was able to pull together and successfully complete two jam packed years at community college taking all the course I needed for an animation and film degree and a liberal arts degree. Granted they were Associates, and it took me 12 years to finish 2 years of college but it's something.\n\nDuring those two college years I found yet another new. Friend group  as well as multiple friends who I had terrible falling outs with in the past. Things were honestly the best they could be at that time.i was even excelling at art which is what I want to do for a living.\n\nSo I leave all of that behind, everything that has finally started to fall into place, and move 2 states away from anyone I know with two goals in mind: to get a game development job, and to become the real me.\n\nVery quickly I start working at Microsoft and it's good if not stressful, but I take the work seriously. Contract terminates earlier than expected leaving me jobless far away from home for the holidays. This is when I finally work up the courage to come out as trans and try to take those steps to change. The safety of going through this far away from loved ones who could possibly reject you wasnt worth the complete social isolation that came with it. Eventually I ended up working for Xbox again, for a while I lived with this crazy gas lighting lady who almost killed me due to actively setting off my allergies, finally got our of there and lived for a year in a fairly more stable place close to work. One really friendly roommate, one who seems to hate me ( but not like the crazy bitch in the last place)\n\nThing is though through all of this career growth and personal gender transition stuff. It was all just terribly lonely multiple times I had become suicidal and came pretty close to ending it twice. I honestly only stay alive because I dont want to hurt my parents. If they weren't in the picture id  kill myself right now no problem. Near the end of my job I was getting these electric jolts through my body, hurt like hell and my coworker forced me to go to the hospital but they found nothing. Those kept going for a while.\nProbably stress, probably largely tied to the new job position I was given getting ripped away from me because my skills as a manager mean nothing when they can just change their mind after the paperwork and months later because an engineer said \"we don't want her to leave our team\" killing my promotion and respect for the job I'd been giving my all everyday.\n\nBy January of this year I was obsessively following  the story of an old suicide victim and sort of just shut down for several weeks .my former boss,now at a much higher paid better position, offered me work but also found my Twitter and the dark suicidal shit I had there. I pretty much got his tragic life story for the past years and how it got him to where he was today . It was too much and overwhelmed my brain for about a week. I never could respond to him, I couldn't take the job despite how life-changing that pay would've been. I knew at this point I needed to be around friends and family and my support network.\n\nI did have some friend in Seattle near the end, and I really liked them, but my mind was so deep into crazy I couldn't bring myself to even say goodbye. I regret this terribly.\n\nSo I moved back to my parents place in March  applying for work down in the cities a few hours south, but the Corona happened and I've just been here this whole time instead. I'm not gonna kill myself living with my parents do I guess that's a positive, but going from those levels of despair to trying to take a stand and fix your life, to then immediately being denied the option as the state of the world is itself one huge problem. Mentally j don't know-how to process any of it anymore.  Trying to keep in touch with all my fractured friend groups from all over is one part overwhelming and one part just anxiety inducing. I thrive off ofdire t  human interaction. Social distancing is important but as someone who's comfortable sitting with a friend but feels like they might die typing a textmessage.   \n\nIm done. I don't remember my point in any of this. Apologies for writing so much.

She taught me love, she taught me how to be happy. She showed me all the good things in life. I cherished her so much, and was there for her all the time.

They weren't exactly the kind that would encourage you to do better, rather scold you for improving on a subject. They were the reason for her unhappiness. Anyways, when they found out, she had tried to save it, save us, save the relationship, but she couldn't... she couldn't keep the one who made her happy, the one who made her think she was special, the one who actually cared so much about her. at least, that's how I saw it. But no, even after how much she had changed for the better, even when her grades improved. They refused to believe that she could be in a relationship... And so, it ended. Just like that, and to think... that just a few weeks before, I gave her my last hug, my last \"I love you\". Just like that, the person who I cared for the most, disappeared. She had told me, that \"Even though we're not like that anymore, I still care for you a lot.\" I told her \"I understand :)\". She didn't want to disappoint her parents. Even though she had put up so much shit with her parents, she still loved them. And even know THEY TREAT HER LIKE SHIT, but she still loves them. That's how much of an angel she is, she's so sweet, and kind. How was I suppose to say \"No, you can't. Disobey your parents so we can be together.\" I couldn't... I love her, so I had to lie, and say \"It's okay :)\". Maybe after her finals we can get back together... Right? Right? That was the plan I had in mind, until she told me, that her parents wanted her to erase every part of me from her life... wtf? Imagine having someone who made you happy, who made you appreciate life, but you were forced to erase every part of that, just wtf? And you know, I thought maybe we can still be friends, still talk to each other normally and have fun. Nope, hahaha, nope. She's not even allowed to text me anymore. I don't see her stories on instagram anymore. It's all gone. She was gone, Even when I had texted her, it's not the same. I knew, I couldn't do anything. I was clueless on how she felt, does she still love me? Does she still care? Does she think of me? I don't know anymore, all i knew, was that I had lost someone I loved and cherished, again... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to move on, but I couldn't. I love her too much. She was the light in my life, she was the reason I woke up with a smile on my face, she was the reason I was looking forward to waking up in the morning. She was the reason, I loved life. Now, I don't even feel a thing, I wake up, dreading about the next thing to do, I don't think about anything, I can't even reply messages the same, She was pinned at the top of my phone, now she's somewhere below. I miss her, It's been a full month, since we split, and I still think of her, I still think if she's okay, I still think if she's eaten, if she's doing okay,... if she still loves me. I'm numb, and worse then I have ever been... i dont cry as often as I used to, but I still cry. I think every night, what if she never comes back, what if her feelings change, what if, she doesn't love me anymore. I try to convince myself that it won't happen, but my heart is aching, cause it's a possibility. It''s possible for me not to see her ever again. Someone, who made my life from a dull, colourless painting, to a world filled with beautiful colours. It's been a month since I've seen her, since our last hug, my last \"I love you\". and I still think of her. I can't move on, I love her so much... now ive changed, and I dont think I can be the same me again. But I lie, I lie to my friends that I'm okay, and that I'll be alright, so that they don't worry, I told her the same thing too, and just yesterday, she was hanging out with her friends, she was smiling. I do see her tweets every now and then, saying her life sucks, and that her problems are coming back up, But i don't message her about it, cause I made a promise, that I wouldn't be worried, that I would ask her, if we could get back together again after her finals, cause I love her so much, noone will be able to replace her, but right now, I'll just hide behind my mask, and let everyone know im okay.

I feel like an emotionless husk every time it happens, like a part of me has drifted even further into the grave. I feel like I'm not even me anymore, like I'm just spectating some poorly written NPC try to stumble through life without anything but \"Eat, drink, sleep\" programmed into its code. \n\nI try to tell myself that I'm fine, reassure myself that things will get better, that my life isn't as bad as I make it out to be, and it's true, I don't have any right to be as depressed as I feel, and knowing that just makes things worse and worse. I beat myself up for feeling bad because I know it could be worse, and I know I have it easy. I feel horrible for even thinking that I could be depressed, because my friends have all had it far worse and they are still able to keep themselves together. I stop myself from telling them anything, because I feel like I'd only be a burden to them, that I'd only make things worse. \n\nThe few people I trusted to actually open up to immediately responded by demonizing me and not understanding, by making me out to be some villain despite me doing everything I possibly can to help, to make things better for them. Then, when I messed up, they would make it clear to me how much of a burden, how useless, how terrible I am. And I believe them. \n\nAnd of course, the icing on the metaphorical cake, I'm afraid. I have pondered, while standing in the kitchen, staring at the knives, many times just ending it all, but I can't ever bring myself to it because I'm too scared. And that just makes me feel even worse, because I know that I won't be able to escape this bottomless pit no matter what, all my efforts fall short and I consciously avoid the only other solutions. I beat myself up again for being too weak, too scared to end it all, then berate myself for being selfish by even thinking about the possibility, and thus a cycle repeats itself.

I don\u2019t know why. It could be some trauma. Some self hatred. I\u2019m in a good relationship, but lately during quarantine it\u2019s been rough. Tbh getting furloughed was the best and worst thing to happen to me. I make more money from unemployment then I did working (not complaining about that) but I am miserable. Before corona hit I feel like I had finally gotten my mental health on track and I was doing so good. I had a set schedule for my day I was working a lot, saw my friends a few times a week it was great. Then the virus hit and I got stuck at home with my SO who hasn\u2019t been the easiest to deal with. He works for a family company and they let him have some time off during the beginning. Now it\u2019s simmered down a bit and he\u2019s able to work (I still am not) I went from working 3 jobs keeping busy to nothing. And I was excited to have \u201ctime off\u201d but it\u2019s been months and I\u2019m going insane with just my SO and myself. My SO was mad I was making so much off of unemployment while he made nothing and less when than I when he worked a 40hr week. Still not my choice I wish I could switch places. He then comes home and destroys the house and gets pissed when I don\u2019t clean and wait on him hand and foot because he works hard for his money and I don\u2019t have to do anything. It\u2019s been really hard. He\u2019s gone a lot for work and when he\u2019s gone I\u2019m alone but when he\u2019s here I\u2019m just belittled and yelled at. I cracked today and told him how I felt and how he was hurting me and he felt bad. And I genuinely think he cared and was a little scared for a while (me too tho). He knows I\u2019m not in a good mental state and he\u2019s not in the best either as you can probably gather. But I\u2019ve really been hurting. My medication isn\u2019t working, my primary dr is moving away and I can\u2019t even get in for an appointment right now anyway. It\u2019s been tough. My therapist has been keeping in contact but she doesn\u2019t know how bad I really am because I don\u2019t want her to put me in a hospital. I\u2019m not suicidal but if something where to happen to me, or someone where to swerve into my line and I was the only one in the car Id let them hit me. Thought about picking up cigarettes to kill my lungs off faster or maybe help speed cancer up, but my SO other said that and tongue piercings were a \u201cdeal breaker\u201d so I don\u2019t. But I do hit others when he isn\u2019t around. That was before the virus. Now I\u2019m trapped in my house cleaning and sleeping to pass the time. Can\u2019t sit down and do a puzzle or read a book because I can\u2019t focus long enough to do it. Things that brought me joy no longer give me the happiness I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019ve thought about harming myself to be in control of my pain but that\u2019s noticeable.  Can\u2019t hide the welts from the rubber bands or the cuts from the razor. Just the pain you feel. I just want to die and leave this world behind for good but I have siblings and a SO who needs me. And tbh if I died who would take care of my two kitties and dog? Things like that keep me going. The fact that my cats will wake me up when they need food or my dog will lay by my side all day if I don\u2019t move are the reasons I get out of bed. I know this is long and probably hard to read because I\u2019m drunk and I don\u2019t drink much anymore, but I need to get some shit off my chest and if you\u2019ve made it this far congratulations lmao I\u2019m sorry. I know I have much more to say but I\u2019ll save it for when I\u2019m sober and sad not drunk and sad.

I feel I never matured past my 14-year mark, and so I think of myself as a 14-year-old (even though the number of years I've lived is obviously more than that). In some ways I feel even younger, though. I think of myself as a little girl, and wish more than anything to be treated as such. But because people don't respect my identity, I live a life of hell. It is nonstop torture to look around and see all the chronological/biological teens who are treated as the kids they are, but not me, because I *know* in my heart I'm still one of them, even though I've been on earth a big longer.\n\nI absolutely hate when I hear comments such as \"how could these people hurt a child???\" or \"no kid should have to go through that,\" because I know that these comments are said with me in mind. I know this special treatment doesn't apply to me, and I wish I could explain how deeply that hurts. In the eyes of the world, I am no longer one of these vulnerable children deserving special care and protection, just because I've crossed some totally arbitrary threshold that determines who is a child/minor and who is an adult. Really, it's completely ARBITRARY, and if people just used their heads and thought for themselves, they would realize that. The only reason they see the defining line as 18 is because that's how the law and society have conditioned them to see things. Why is a 17-year-old considered a \"child,\" but a 22-year-old is considered an \"adult\"? There are only five years between them, which is nothing in the grand scheme of things. I mean, why couldn't the adult line have been set at 25? Or 43? Or 87? Or anything else in between?\n\nI've done a lot of studying on this subject, and I have yet to find any conclusive scientific evidence that there is some magical change that happens in a person's brain between the ages of 17 and 18 to magically transform them into an adult. All that number is is an arbitrary line the government had to draw for convenience purposes!!!! But everybody acts like that's the end all be all. Screw that mentality. I don't define my age by how long I've been alive, I define it by how I act, feel, and want to be treated. I may not be 14 in the sense that I've lived 14 years, but I am 14 inside. I am 14 mentally, emotionally, and in my behavior. I KNOW that I am still a kid, and if other people can't understand and respect that, then they simply don't belong in my life. I'm tired of having to live a lie, because honestly, at this point, I'd take death over the alternative. I'd rather kill myself than go on having to present as an adult, because that's NOT who I am. I want to be played with, cuddled, and nurtured like the child I am. I DESERVE those things, and I'm tired of the world around me telling me I'm not. I am NOT less deserving of love and protection just because I've crossed some bullshit barrier. I am not going to let other people tell me who I am anymore. I am who I am, and if you don't like it, too bad! You can just get out of my life.

He told me to kill myself, that Mother\u2019s Day was a fake holiday, that I wasn\u2019t his mother why should I be celebrated Once he reduced me to tears he kicked me out of the house. I\u2019ve never mentioned it since (or birthdays or Christmas, he doesn\u2019t celebrate those either). The last interaction I had with him last night before I went to bed was bad. I said something he didn\u2019t like, I didn\u2019t mean it in a bad way but it really upset him. I\u2019ve laid in bed all Mother\u2019s Day morning afraid of him waking up, when he did I could hear him in the other room, he\u2019s in a bad mood. Today will be set in that tone. I\u2019ll walk on eggshells all day, hopefully nothing I do makes him too mad, the last thing I need is an outburst.

Just looking to get some words of my chest is all. \n\n\n\nIts hard for me to express my feelings so i\u2019m not gonna go into detail. Recently since about Christmas time last year, my life, i feel, has just gone to absolute shit. I mean, i usually have my downs (before Christmas) but i\u2019m able to recover from them relatively easy. However since Christmas, it\u2019s just been one thing after another and just can\u2019t seem to get a grip on my life. I feel like i\u2019m fighting so many wars on so many fronts and my \u201ctroops\u201d are being depleted at an astonishing rate. I just feel like a complete failure and i don\u2019t feel like a real man. All the shit within the past 6 months have taken their tole on me and it is eating away at me. And since quarantine began in March, it has all magnified 2 fold. Doing my usual things to pick myself up just aren\u2019t cutting it anymore like they used to and i\u2019m being forced to figure out new ways to provide solutions to my problems and i don\u2019t even have a solution to that problem within itself. I have never said this before to anyone and even i feel mildly uncomfortable saying all of this. I have so much to unpack that i feel as if i\u2019m beyond the point of talking to someone that it is a burden on them and even if it wasn\u2019t a burden, i or someone else wouldn\u2019t have enough time for me to say everything i feel. I just am absolutely clueless as to what to do with myself now. For all my life, i\u2019ve always told myself i will never get depression but now, i feel like i\u2019m on that path to being depressed. I\u2019m just a lost soul trying to figure out how to take on the world while keeping my sanity and masculinity in touch because i feel like i\u2019m losing both. Anyways, i have so much more i\u2019d like to say but this is all i want to say without it being a complete essay. Thanks to those who read this.

I have seen in my very eyes how she had boyfriends, then ended up breaking without reaching a year long relationship. I thought I already deleted my feelings for good, but not until last May. There was this simple drawing I never planned to post to my FB story, but my mom posted it along with some of my artworks without my consent. Unknowingly, my mom and her are FB friends so she saw it. The drawing was a girl student wearing our uniform in my previous school who interestingly, is referenced to her except that I am not that good at drawing and I did not draw her eyeglasses so that it would be not too obvious for my batchmates. But the f*cking thing happened. She liked it. As I was posting my simple artworks, she messaged me to post the said 'special' drawing. I did not know what to reply. Not just that I never knew what artwork she meant but also, the freaking artwork was referenced to her. But anyway, I posted it to grant her request because why not, it was her who requested. Things started to go uphill from here.\nAs soon as she saw it, she immediately messaged me to appreciate what I have done. I was fluttered but I acted as humble as I can. Sometimes I wish I never replied to that f*cking message. It was at this moment she opened out to me out of nowhere. She began talking about weird things that I was not interested because as much as I want to talk to her, I was forbidden to do so. I tried to end the conversation and today I wished it ended so I could stop hurting myself. But the conversation continued until I asked her if she is okay because of the way she acted. Especially because, the last time we talked (fought) was about 3 years ago.  She started crying and explained to me what happened. She recently broke up with her boyfriend. That explained a lot of things to me. That's why she left our gamer's group chat and that's why she was talking weird things. But that left me an unanswered wuestion. Why was I the destiny chose to be her listener? My feelings revived and I don't know what had happened next. I know I don't deserve to feel what I feel but I apologize because unlike you guys, I am f*cking weak hearted.\nToday, July 9, I finished drawing a decent sketch of her. I was planning to give it to her in her birthday. But I am too shy to do so. What should I do? Should I send it to her or not?

I don\u2019t know how to say this,, but shes been cheating on my dad for years, and I\u2019m the only one that knows about this, she even has a secret boyfriend. I don\u2019t know how to feel about this...\n\nEven when I try to forget... I always caught her talking to him or sending him \u201cweird\u201d photos of her.. \n\nSecondly, she suddenly changed,, I don\u2019t know why, she\u2019s been treating me badly as if I did something horrible for her, I try to not to give it much thoughts about her treating me differently than my other siblings, but this one keeps haunting me everytime I try to: \n\nWhen I tell her about my insecurities she just gives me \u2018that\u2019 annoyed look and tell me that there\u2019s no reason to be insecure in a harsh tone. And when I told her about something I don\u2019t like about myself she started told me to \u201cstop being a b**ch\u201d. But when my brother came and told her about what\u2019s bothering him, she started comforting him and encouraging him. She always defended him even when he makes fun of me when I sometimes yell at him, and no he\u2019s not joking he even asks me why do I look like this, how much my (insert body/face part) scares him, and call me really bad names. She just laugh and say \u201coh look he\u2019s roasting her\u201d, it sometimes look like she doesn\u2019t care about my feelings. I\u2019m not exaggerating, even when she sees me crying she doesn\u2019t say anything. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that she was never been emotionally with me shortly after I discovered her \u2018secret\u2019, she doesn\u2019t even know that I know that.\n\nShe always compare me to my cousins, nephews, making me feel that I\u2019m not the daughter she \u2018expected\u2019 me to have.\n\nNot gonna make this part any longer, but I just have to say these three things that hurt me to this day\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only out of your siblings who always make me feel ashamed.\u201d\n\nShe curses me and start \u2018bad\u2019-talking about me when I just tell her to \u2018wait for a few seconds\u2019 because I\u2019m busy a little bit, I don\u2019t have four hands, do I? I was heading to her anyways, but when I came i found her talking to someone about how much of a b**ch, trash and bad daughter I am. Even after I did so much and still defended her there is no use, I guess.\nNo, I dont act sassy towards her, in fact, if I did that she\u2019s gonna hit my so hard and slap me.\n\nAlso those times when I was so sick that I couldn\u2019t move, she slapped me so hard and shouted \u201care you gonna go to school or not?!\u201d at me. And when I said \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d weakly because I was so sick she started saying how \u201clazy\u201d, \u201creckless\u201d and \u201ca bad student\u201d I am. And of course, after my siblings went, she started saying how they\u2019re going while I\u2019m here missing school. But when my brother stays at home with me, she doesn\u2019t complain or anything, but suddenly feel \u2018sympathetic\u2019 toward both of us. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overlooking things, but it kinda bothers me.\n\nI won\u2019t continue about my mom but let\u2019s move on to another thing that makes me sad;\n\nMy relatives, and family members.\n\nBecause of them I just feel like I\u2019m suffocating, I don\u2019t know if they even wanted me to be part of their family in the first place. I\u2019m just trying to be good, but there is no use, I am just not talented or anything of what they expected.\n\nLet\u2019s start with my grandma, she always tell me how my brother is the \u201conly one who do whatever I tell him right after I tell him\u201d, what\u2019s the problem? you might ask, the problem is that her sayings are false. I have to move 24/200 to get her everything without even telling her anything, I get her everything she wants. I even wash the plates, clean the carpets and other things often but i guess it\u2019s not enough. \n\nShe keeps calling me \u2018stupid\u2019 and that even animals are smarter than me, and if I did anything wrong or couldn\u2019t find the right thing she wants she start yelling at me until my soul leave my body. My grandma always keep praising my brothers, my cousins, and everyone but me. She keeps telling everyone how my cousin is smart, an amazing student, good cooker(?), and yeah. She just loves her so much, she treats her so well, and never have called her a quarter of what she call me. \n\nMy grandma keeps praising my siblings of course, but I barely remember her complimenting me. \n\nWhat bothers me even more is that I still trust her, so when I told her about my insecurities and how her sisters were body-shaming me she just said nonsense and didn\u2019t make me feel better but worse. \n\nAs for my relatives, in some way, they always make me feel left out. They always have fun with my sibling, laugh with them, play with them, make jokes with them, complimenting him, telling him how beautiful he is, just so much.\n\nWhile I\u2019m here standing, even when I say something it seems that they don\u2019t pay much attention, or don\u2019t care, nothing. The only times they respond in a way I\u2019d kinda wish they always do that is when none of my brothers are around. You got the point. I\u2019m trying my hardest. But no use. \n\nFor one of my cousins, one time I was alone with her, she suddenly closed the door and turned off the lights, she started kicking me and hitting me. And when my siblings knew about it, they did nothing, they didn\u2019t even bother to ask her why, and one of my brothers was with me, he just asked the driver to start driving us home. My body was full of \u2018marks\u2019. I still feel kinda sad, as I was only five. I always tried to befriend her, but it\u2019s just that I\u2019m unlikeable. Even in my school nobody wanted to be with me, I was just too kind that they kinda took that to their own advantage, because I always knew that if I didn\u2019t do what they like I\u2019ll be lonely. I got betrayed a lot by my old classmates, I was friends with fake people who I considered \u2018best friends\u2019, they didn\u2019t bother to text me, not even saying hi or anything.  But I\u2019m not gonna \u2018vent\u2019 about this one because this is kinda irrelevant.\n\nNow for my mom\u2019s mom ( my other grandma ), she loves to doubt me, even my uncle loves to do that too. Specially when I was young, When she asked me what\u2019s my weight and I answered her, she looked at me with a weird look and said \u2018wow, I thought you were 45 or something.\u2019 Now 45 is not bad, but imagine a short 10 years old that weights 45? Being fat was always something that almost feels \u2018forbidden\u2019 in my family, so I got really sad. No hate to anyone who\u2019s overweight or anything, I\u2019m talking about my family\u2019s \u2018standards\u2019. \n\nAnd when I watch videos of American/ People who talk in English, they always ask me if I know English or understand anything, when I say \u2018yes\u2019 they deny it and say that I don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying. It kinda annoys me.\n\nWhen she asks me if I memorised ( insert something she told me to ) and I answer her with a \u2018yes\u2019, she denies and tell me to tell her the whole thing along with other things that have nothing to do with it just to prove that I did memorise it. These two ( my grandma and uncle ) just really love to destroy me, There\u2019s a lot more they did but it\u2019s getting kinda hard to type. But.. do I really look that stupid to the point you think I can\u2019t do anything? \n\n\n\nNow to another thing that makes me feel sad: \n\nMy current and old classmates. for my old classmates, I was just someone they could use everytime they needed help or anything. I\u2019m not gonna say the whole thing, but I\u2019ll only say this one:\n\nI remember when I was young, they were giving us, 1st graders, gifts. I was one of the last people to get my gift. In our way to my class, the smartest girl in my old school told me, and I quote, \u201cyou know why you were the very-last person to get your gift? Because you\u2019re not smart like us.\u201d \n\nTo this day, every time I feel not smart, or don\u2019t get the full mark, I remember this. It hurts, specially that I know it. After two years I had a what-you-call a \u2018glow up\u2019 and became one of the top 10 students... but I can\u2019t help but remember it, specially that this year my marks were not as high as the \u2018usual\u2019. This year, I got a 92% or 93% or 95%, I don\u2019t really remember. I know I\u2019m stupid and childish but I felt like I\u2019m not smart like before, I felt the glow up only lasted for few years but it\u2019s \u2018fading\u2019 away now.\n\nThankfully my dad didn\u2019t get angry, but he acknowledged my feelings and started cheering me up, he still do that from time to time. But my negative self decided to make these encouragements to another reason to feel sad. How?

I have never felt like this about someone, but I have never actually met them in person. The only way I know this person is through pictures and what they tell me over the internet. From this point on I'll call her Jay.\n\nI have had my share of relationships throughout my years, but I never really felt like it meant anything. After dating so many people and never feeling anything you start to feel like you might be incapable of love. This is how I felt for about a year and a half until I found Jay.\n\nWhen I first \"met\" Jay I didn't think anything of it. Just another human that I dont particularly care for until one night she was extremely upset and began telling me all of her problems. She explained all of her personal struggles with depression and anorexia etc. Under normal circumstances I just pretend to care, go through the motions to make them feel like they matter, and leave it at that. However, this time was different. I actually felt something for her. As she told me all of her hardships I felt a lump formulate in my throat. \n\nBy the time she was done I was crying my ass off like a 2 year old. Keep in mind I haven't cried for many years. It was around 3 A.M and I was about to go to bed, then she sent me a picture of her face. This was the first time I ever saw what she looked like. Her eyes were glossy and her face was a little flushed, most likely from crying, and she was smiling. I looked at that picture for an hour. In her smile I could see all the sadness and anxiety that I see in myself. It was a completely and utterly fake smile. The smile I give everyone to make them think I give a fuck. From that moment on I haven't been able to take my mind off of her. The thing that makes this story even sadder is I will never be able to be with her. \n\nThere are a few reasons why we won't ever be together. One being we live on opposite sides of the country. The second is our difference in age. I am almost 7 years younger then she is. I do not have a problem with large age gaps, but the people around me do. Not that I give a shit.

And the rest are people I was close to at one point and then their lives got busy, my life got busy, they quit social media, or we just don't click anymore. As I got older I got more private and posted less.. and now I will post once every few months. I don't want to share anything with many of them, they don't understand me.\n\nThe three best friends I had left, one became a hermit only pops his head out of his room for work once a week and retreats. He quit social media and got paranoid about smart phones, so he went back to a flip phone I can't send him \"fire ass memes\" anymore. Another got married and has family, became super religious is totally nothing like when we were best friends in our youth, we talk once in a while but it's nothing like when we would hang out and be ourselves, talk about what happened to us. \n\nAnd lastly the one I with connected to most, we didn't meet til later in life. She and I went to so many concerts together, explored so many cities together, shared so much music - all her music has become part of my daily playlists. Well one day the platonic aspect of it went out the window and now it's a more FWB type of thing, and she doesn't want to catch feelings so she keeps conversations short, or she will be too busy. \n\nI am not the type to have FWB and that's why I wanted to stay platonic, but how can someone say no to someone as stunning as her? The male organ I have took over and kept saying do it while I was shaking nervously knowing it wasn't a good idea, but had I not then what would have came of the situation? She would have been embarrassed to be declined, and I..would have kept thinking \"what if?...\" For the rest of my life... Now all I think about is trying to make her love me the way I've came to love her, but she can't. She won't allow herself to fall for the trap of \"love.\" \n\nAnd well now I'm all out of best friends, 3k miles from home and no one I trust around me. I don't make friends easily, I am a nihlist. I see myself too smart for anyone around here, but not good enough to be their friends. Most of the people here like to drink, smoke, party; that's not my thing, it never was.

He lived well into his 80s and even then, he spent all his time renovating his house for my grandma. He's the reason I push myself to work so hard, because I've always wanted to be seen as someone with that kind of work ethic.\n\nOne of my childhood memories involved me going over to his house to do work for him. 14-year-old me didn't have the drive I have now, and I made every excuse I could to get out of working. I remember how disappointed he looked at me. And I kept that memory with me, one day hoping I would get the chance to change his view of me.\n\nDuring the final week of his life, I had the opportunity to visit him and take care of whatever he needed. He asked me to work for him. I think I knew it'd be the last chance I'd ever get. So I pushed myself. I worked hard and I refused to even let one second pass fruitlessly. I didn't get the chance to see or hear him again. He fell asleep, and in his final days I wanted to give him all the rest he could get.\n\nTwo days pass. I'm woken up at 7:00. My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep during the night, in his own bed. Unexpectedly so, he had seemed to be doing better.\n\nWe went up to my grandparents house. Each person took a turn visiting his final resting place. Except me. \n\nMaybe I was too squeamish. Maybe I didn't want to be around death. Or maybe, maybe I thought that as soon as I saw him lying there that it'd be real, and I'd have to accept it. And accepting it wasn't something I was ready to do just yet.\n\nMistake number one. I wish I could have seen him one last time, no matter how much it hurt.\n\nI didn't feel much for the next few days. Numb. I had a speech tournament to prepare for. I lived my life normally, as if nothing had changed.\n\nThen the news broke to me: My grandfather's funeral was on the same day as the tournament, which was out of state. I'd have to make a choice.\n\nMentally immature and still unwilling to accept his passing, I made the second wrong decision regarding his death. My choice haunts me to this day, which is why I'm staying up to 4:08 in the morning, trying to get this off my chest in the hopes that maybe it'll leave me be.\n\nI gave it my damned hardest, and during that tournament, I did the best I'd ever done up to that point.\n\nI remember nothing about the tournament. I remember nothing about the speeches I gave. The debates I had. All I remember was that when it was over, I texted my sister \"do you think he'd be proud of me?\" And cried for the first time since his passing.\n\nI went home, knowing I'd made a wrong choice. Knowing that this feeling of absolute regret wasn't going to leave me alone.\n\nThere was no one there to greet me. The door was unlocked. I threw my backpack in a corner.\n\nThen I noticed an envelope on the dresser drawer. It was addressed to me, from my grandfather. He'd written it to me before he passed, and it only just reached my hands. I don't want to write everything he wrote down because it's very personal to me.

I can't hold meal sized portions of food and throw up a lot because. Also my lvls get very low and if I dont get to an er im stuck in a state of blacking out which is scary. I've blacked out and hit my head a few times and twice I've woken up in a pile of blood. So in my eyes it seems next to impossible that someone could look past all that and want to grow and share life with. \nWell about a year ago I started reaching out to a girl who I had spent time with in college. We had a whole day of fucking the first time we hung outside of class and then didn't interact much cause she was technically in a relationship. Fast forward 9 yearsish and we're just Facebook friends but she is posting sad things and clearly struggling and I thought since we didn't end over a fight or argument I could ask if she was ok without it being awkward. (I'm learning my worst trait is wanting to help the wrong people.) Either way over the years she got married and divorced and spent a lot of time down south. She was back in Vermont (where we live now) and spoke about how she was just having a hard time adjusting. After talking a lot and reconnecting I suggested she come up(she was in southern vt and I was in North vt) and we could catch up and she agreed. Of course in the beginning it was great. We connected so well and starting talking 24/7. A few weeks go by and everyother week she was over. It was basically honey moon state with a lot of great sex an holding each other. I was in a state of bliss. It had been so long since I had been touched by another person. I was in shock that she seemed to actually enjoy my company and it gave me hope. It's also important to note she was living with another guy back at her home. She complained about him all the time and I always was there to help guide her thru that situation because he very much liked her. After a few weeks we pondered the idea of going out but knew that it would cause issues with her home lover boy. One night we kinda both decided that we would figure out the details later and we were official. Of course he freaks out after a few weeks. (important to know this dude bought her so much shit to the point where he cosigned on a new car) but in the weeks leading up she kept revealing new info. Apparently she shared a bed with him, he did her laundry, demanded to watch her get dressed, straight up weird shit . To which I responded \"normal people don't do that\" \nAfter awhile he just got super upset and had a bunch of friends hang out and laugh at her while recording from their phones. She calls me in a panic at like 11 at night crying saying to need to go get her. Of course I said yes and me and my roommate took his car and drove 3 hours down to get her. She loaded up all her shit. Everything except for a dresser and dog cage. Then when we get home we situate all her stuff and I incorporate her into my life. Then the next few months are ok but it sucked because the guy who gave her the car took it back so she had no vehicle and I was forced to use my roommates jaguar(not in the best of shape) and my life turned into driving her to work, driving my roommate to work, and picking them both up at different times. She was a job hopper in the sense that I was driving to a new work place once every 2 months, constantly going to interviews and the worst part was that she was getting jobs an hour's drive away and not in town so a lot of money went to gas which was always complained about. i can say I easily drove to over 30 interviews and that put a lot of miles on my roommates car.  Eventually the routine became waking up at 4, leaving at 5 to get to work for 6 in the morning, drive home and bring my roommate to work at 2 on and then picking up her. Then she would go to bed early while I had to stay up to pick up my roommate at 10 pm. So I was getting at most 5 hours a night. I already have bad sleeping problems and being sick this just made the situation worse. Over time I learned how 2 faced she can be. I got to know the real her who shit on all her friends and thought everything revolved around her. Also after a few months she took our relationship off Facebook and I asked why and she said it wasn't important. Unable to change her mind she went on looking like she was making it on her own(I payed for all the bills and food and she had no bills so all money she made was spent frivolously even tho she was \"saving\"). I told her going into all this that I was on a fixed income because of my disability and it would not be like other relationships. She said she'd never hurt me. That she was the type of person to stay and work it out. Well towards the end she stopped saying I love you. Stopped letting me touch her. Even sleeping in the same bed became an issue for her and I could never understand why. Then this Monday after work when we get home I ask if things are ok and she says she doesn't love me and that she doesn't want to fix or work at making it better. Of course I start crying cause I see she doesn't want anything to do with me. And as I'm crying and asking why she won't tell me and let me make it right, she laughs right in my face and plays on her phone the whole time.  She leaves and takes the dog so she can get sleep for work in some mystery vehicle. I spent the night freaking out unable to stop crying. The next day she shows up around 5 or 6 pm with a new guy(someone she always brought up after work. She works at planet fitness. I was always worried she'd find someone muscle head and leave me cause I'm so weak. I was right) and she calls and wants to be let inside to get all her stuff. I was still crying and explaining how I was too scared and uncomfortable to let her in and that I would give her a time once I had calmed down to get her things and her and the new guy just start mocking me and laughing at me over the phone. At that point I'm so exhausted from crying and so hurt and I just don't understand how someone can just throw away a year's worth of being together and act as if nothing has happened.That night she said all she wanted were her clothes, legal papers, and her dog stuff so I spent the night gathering everything together and it hurt so bad. But I finished and gave it to a mutual friend. \nI'm just so lost right now. A lot of people have reached out on Facebook and I appreciate that so much, but in my situation it's so hard to find self worth and everyone is saying focus on me but life is so much easier for me when I have someone next to me. Now I'm back to spending all day alone and it's never good. I freak out when I feel like I'm going to be alone forever. I was getting healthy and now I'm back to not being able to eat anything, my body is sore and aches  and I pushed myself so hard to be there for her in every aspect. Bills, car ride to all the job interviews and to and from work, taking care of the dog, sharing my limited income, making whatever she wanted food wise whenever she wanted, only listening to her music when we\u2019re both in the car, running to the store to get her drinks while she stayed in bed, fuck I could go on and on but she claims this relationship is all one sided and she's the only one trying. And now she's gone forever and I'm just stuck trying to figure out how someone could use and take advantage of a disabled person. I'm scared and I'm alone and I miss that damn dog. Everyone is saying time will help and it's like, no shit, but right now I wish I couldn't feel anything and be as cold as her so I could at least get some rest. All I ever wanted was to help her and in the end she didnt even care about all I had done to protect her. I've never posted on Reddit before so I guess I have no idea what happens from here but I'm not in the best state of mind and my eyes hurt so bad.", "title": "Girlfriend cheats and laughs and mocks me to my face as I cry and watch my world crumble."}, {"created_utc": 1580485276, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/ewq7ie/i_just_needed_to_went_i_had_to_put_down_my_cat_of/", "num_comments": 13, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I just needed to went.

I'm a 17 year old guy who lives in Australia, I am in my final year of school (Grade 12) and have grown up with and gone through school with a group of 5-6 guys. In earlier years such as grade 7-10 we were the best of friends we were actually brothers, I love them and still do. Sounds pretty cliche but people used to call us the \"brother hood\". In recent years we just gradually drifted apart, we still went to the same school, still had classes together, still hung out in school but something wasn't right, and it was like I was the only one that could feel it. We all just gradually stopped hanging out of school, but that's what I thought, I kept thinking this whilst they kept hanging out after school. They would play Australian rules football together on the same team, and I would train to be an umpire (the would tease me about being an umpire) I got really good at umpiring and climbed the ranks and I have already traveled the country to umpire. They knew umpiring was a huge passion of mine, and yet they would still tease me about it. It got to the stage when I would be winning all of these huge umpiring awards and trophies and even being given a contract to umpire a huge league, which pays really well to a 17 year old, what hurt the most is that I didn't have any of these achievements of mine to share with anyone. Not one of the boys has texted me, snap chatted me or rang me in the last year. I don't really know the point of why I am writing this, I just want some one to hear me. hear my sadness. hear my screams. I have a very loving girlfriend who I have not told my troubles to, she lives across the road from one of \"best friends\", the amount of times I have seen all of my best friends walk into that house is countless, all doing something, making plans, going out to have a drink, with out me.

gonna be long so if you read this thank you \n\nbut the story starts here first day freshman year i was put in the gym class and i was the only freshman in the class. there was this girl kenadee she was the prettiest girl i have ever seen she was a junior and i wanted her attention so bad i would so anything just for her attention. i acted fake depressed just so she would text me well she got tired of it and decided to block me on everything. i was heartbroken it took me a year to get over her. well during that year i made new friends a crowd i has never hung out with before. this crowd i felt like i could be my self i got introduced to drugs alcohol nicotine all that.  \n\n(SEPTEMBER SOPHOMORE YEAR)\n\nwell there\u2019s was this girl her name is keri. i thought she was cute but i never actually talked to her. i was at a football game and i was with my bestfriend kam and kam was part of my new crowd of friends and he always would let me hit his vapes. well keri was trying to get someone to get his sworn and i over heard and i said \u201c i can get it for you\u201d and she was like ok so i asked him for it and he said it was dead so i told her that. that was the first time we ever talked. after the weekend monday morning she comes up to me and we talked and i was really nervous. i forgot what we talked about but that was the last time we talked for a long time. \n\n\nJANUARY 2ND SEMESTER\n\n2nd semester comes around and we get new classes and i sit down in my 4th period of the day also the final. i\u2019m sitting watching who comes in and keri comes in and i say \u201ckeri\u201d she looks at me and smiles and comes sits next to me and we just started talking and joking. i get time and tell kam \u201cyo you know keri i think i like her\u201d and he\u2019s telling me to do all this stuff and i\u2019m like ok ok. i put her on my priv story on snap and she slides up on a video of me dancing as a joke and i fall off my bed and says \u201c i fw your vibe a lot and fw you as a person\u201d and that made me feel good and stuck with me. me and keri get close facetime everyday all that. well she had this bestfriend maddie and maddie meets up with me and keri everyday after 4th period and we all walk to the busses together. i don\u2019t remember how but we became friends but we never really talked.\n\nVALENTINE\u2019s DAY\n\nthe thursday before valentine\u2019s day maddie was in our lunch and as a joke she was like wanna be my valentine i was like ok so kam goes out that night to get me valentine candy because my mom wouldn\u2019t let me get any and he gives me it so i can give it to maddie well that night maddie had a kickback party at her house but i couldn\u2019t come because my mom doesn\u2019t let me do anything. kam was there keri was there and all of my other friends. keri was drunk and kam was drunk and keri was all over kam and i was on facetime with maddie the whole night and she flipped the camera and i just saw keri on top of kam and kam pulling her down maddie was really drunk and told me all her secrets and said she was in love with keri. after that night of me and maddie on the phone all night we got really close and kam tells me the next day that keri gave him head and i didn\u2019t act like it but i was pissed he knew i liked her and still did it but i gave up on keri because i know she would never like me but we are still friends so everyday me keri and maddie would facetime.\n\na few week later late february \n\nwe were all in a group facetime and i had to ask kam a question so i added him to a call and keri left instantly so jt was me maddie and kam and kam says something like \u201c oh the whore left\u201d and i was like haha yeah well we all leave because keri wouldn\u2019t anwser and keri was calling maddie. maddie answers and keri asked what did y\u2019all talk about and she tells her and keri gets mad at kam for calling her a whore me for laughing and maddie for not defending her. keri blocks me on snap for a few day\u2019s and i felt like it was all happening again. so for a week it was just me and maddie and this is where i caught feelings for her. keri texts me and apologies and it\u2019s the trio again.\n\nMARCH (corona virus shuts everything down) \n\nwe get out of school because of corona for 2 weeks and maddie wasn\u2019t answering my calls and i texted her and said \u201cwhy\u201d. she said she couldn\u2019t handle clingy people and it made her feel like she couldn\u2019t breathe. i didn\u2019t want to lose her so i said sorry i can\u2019t lose you so i\u2019ll leave you alone and she said it\u2019s not your fault you didn\u2019t know and i was like ok i\u2019ll leave you alone my bad i need you and i can\u2019t lose you too. i shouldn\u2019t have said that last part because i think i stressed her out she didn\u2019t talk to me for a month and i hated my self that whole month. i was going crazy then one morning she texts me apologizing saying she\u2019s been a bad friend and i text back and i\u2019m just glad she came back but she was taking a week to respond to everything. i don\u2019t remember much other than during this time is when i found out i caught feelings. \n\nmay \n\nmy birthday is here i turn 16 and my mom didn\u2019t let me do anything for my birthday so one night i was gonna sneak out and go to a bonfire kam keri and most important maddie was there i just wanted to see her well i never snuck out my mom was downstairs all night. \n\n\na few weeks later \n\nit\u2019s maddies birthday and i just wanted to see her again kam was driving everyone around and i snuck out so i could hang out with maddie i get in and we were gonna rent a hotel for the night we were in the mcdonald drive through 5 min from my house and i start getting calls from my mom and they dropped me off at her front of the neighborhood and i answer the phone and tell her i was just taking a walk and i got grounded ( still grounded ) and my dad came up the next from savannah i have a back up phone so i was with my dad for a week and he knew the whole situation my dad is cool and he knew i wasn\u2019t gonna be able to see anyone for a long time so he was gonna let me hang out with one of my friends house for a few hours. so i chose maddie i told no one it was just me and her and finally it felt like we going back to normal we started texting again all that. one day maddie was at keri house and i facetime keri with kam and this is when i was tired of being sober and started doing whip it\u2019s. i\u2019m not proud but i was doing them and i was high out of my mind and they were all trying to get me to stop when kam said if you don\u2019t stop i will get maddie to block you on everything and she did. this was only a week ago and it\u2019s awkward because i got her this send a friend thing a week before and it just came yesterday and i\u2019m still blocked but idk what to do i love her with my whole heart and yeah that\u2019s the whole

Our childhood was not exactly Beaver Cleaver idyllic, so we have a tight bond over the shit we went through.  When I moved out of state for college, he followed shortly after.  Throughout his life I\u2019ve bailed him out of sticky situations, kept his secrets, and helped him out when he needed it.  Some time ago he moved back to our home state, met a wonderful young woman, and got married.  \n\nAs time has gone on, our sibling relationship changed, which is to be expected, but as we are polar opposites in nature, it\u2019s lead to us butting heads.  He\u2019s younger than me, and has made some not-great life choices.  He\u2019s an adult and I have deliberately not said anything to him about them, because it\u2019s not my place and I\u2019m not there to police his money and decisions.  But his impulsivity is a constant theme, and when he is challenged on any decision, no matter how inconsequential, his response is to dig his heels in and react out of anger.  His handle on his temper is shitty, by his own admission, but he shrugs it off as having his \u201cDad\u2019s temper\u201d and that he can\u2019t help it.  It has led to friction between us for his reactions to things over the years.\n\nTwo and a half years ago, our Dad died very suddenly.  He was the parent that raised us through the childhood shittiness.  He was our rock, our hero, and his death was nothing short of devastating for both of us.  I don\u2019t know if my brother has ever really recovered from it.  I had sought therapy and it was helpful for me, so with his blessing I looked into therapy options for him as he does not have insurance.  He never pursued therapy or support services.  I tried to be there for him as much as I could, but he just stuffed it down and carried on with life.\n\nAfter our dad\u2019s death, his assets were divided between my older sister, my brother, and myself.  My sister didn\u2019t take any of his physical possessions aside from a few photos.  My dad had said he wanted his motorcycles to go to my brother in the event of his passing, so they were given to him without him having to compensate me or my sister for \u201cour share\u201d in them.  That was not a problem for me as I wanted to honor his wishes.  I let my brother take the home videos, patches from my dad\u2019s time running around with an \u201coutlaw motorcycle gang\u201d, a lot of his clothes, things from the house, and so on.  After about a year and a half, my brother asked for the family photos I had taken from the house, to scan them for digital copies.  I gave them to him.  Other than the photos that I eventually gave to him, I took a few small things (a coffee cup, a T-shirt, etc) and about 2/3rds of my dad\u2019s firearms, which were about six long guns and two handguns.  The other third went with my brother.  I do have a rifle that belongs to my brother, and a shotgun that was passed from my grandfather to my father, who intended in passing it to his son.  I am a-okay with returning those guns to him as they have sentimental value to him.\n\nHe contacted me about a month ago asking for the specifics of one of the handguns in my possession that was our Dad\u2019s.  He had purchased this gun only a couple years before his passing, so it wasn\u2019t a family heirloom or anything like that.  I told him the specifics (.44 Magnum) and he said he wanted me to give him \u201chis\u201d gun.  I wasn\u2019t keen on the idea on this for two reasons.  One: All I kept from my Dad was small trinkets and his guns.  My brother has asked for things from me previously and I\u2019d given them to him, but I did want to keep some things.  Two: My brother, as I mentioned, is a hothead.  He\u2019s quick to fight and escalates things quickly.  The idea of him having a gun like that scares me, because I actually can see him waving it at somebody when he\u2019s pissed off, and getting arrested for that, or worse.  He has no experience with handguns.  I really feel that giving him the gun has the real potential to go poorly.\n\nWhen I declined to give it to him, he immediately got belligerent.  Telling me not to \u201cdo this to [him].\u201d  That I was stabbing him in the back.  That he would be coming down to my city to retrieve the two long guns I mentioned I\u2019d be returning to him, and that since I was refusing to give him the revolver, that he would have to involve \u201cthe law\u201d or an attorney.  He threatened to involve our sister (the executrix of my dad\u2019s estate) and the estate attorney to \u201cget back what belongs to [him]\u201d despite the guns not being listed as assets in the estate and the estate being closed already.  I strongly encouraged him, in those words exactly, to reconsider involving an attorney over this because it was not an action that he could take back.  He reaffirmed his decision to consult legal services, and ended the conversation.  After he threatened to hire an attorney against me, I told him that if he wished to speak with me further on the subject, to send it to my email, and any further texts wouldn\u2019t be acknowledged.  I\u2019ve not heard another word.\n\nIt hurt.  It hurt a lot.  My own brother threatened to sue me over the possession of a revolver.  It\u2019s a huge slap in the face that I didn\u2019t ever anticipate.  He spoke to my sister, who said she had no paperwork regarding the guns and declined to get involved as she dislikes guns, stating that she requested I take the firearms from his house the night our dad died so they wouldn\u2019t be unguarded, and that was the furthest she wished to be involved with them.  He talked to our mom, saying Dad \u201cwould have wanted [him] to have it.\u201d  She asked him why he wanted it so badly two and a half years after Dad\u2019s death, and his reasoning was that he wanted to take it to the range and shoot it a few times.  \n\nMy mom wants me to talk to him and resolve this, but Im still reeling from the whole exchange.  With the way he spoke to me and treated me, I don\u2019t even want to see him or talk to him.  I\u2019m inclined to just give him the damn gun and reduce our relationship to \u201ccordial.\u201d  I\u2019m done giving him rides to family functions.  He\u2019s not welcome in my home.  The way he was so callous, I don\u2019t think I can ever really forget it, even though I can forgive.  I\u2019ve felt like utter shit since then, in disbelief that someone who I was so close with all of my life was now saying he was going to sue me.  It sounds trite, but never in a million years would I have guessed that it would ever come to this sort of situation.  I just feel betrayed.\n\nThanks for reading if you got this far.
