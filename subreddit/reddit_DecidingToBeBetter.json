I was continually in dark and lonely places since middle school, but the mid-2010s were the worst. I tried hard to look for the bright spots as I wrote my nonsense, and there actually were some amusing if cringeworthy memories. But the majority of my writing reflected so much insecurity, confusion, loneliness, and pain. I was more arrogant, judgmental, and even bigoted than I thought, even though I insisted to myself (in writing too) that I wasn't. I was also a bully. Even things and people I had thought were positive factors in my life were all turned on their heads at some point, and I didn't know how to handle that shift well. So I imploded. I had to put in a strange amount of effort to write good things about myself, and struggled heavily to reach conclusions with practicing forgiveness and compassion, in both directions.\n\nI wrote journals since I was 10. 5 years ago I stopped journaling completely, and even thought I would never read the contents of my last recent journal again, because I knew it was nothing but my deepest hole (that I had documented so far, anyway). That all changed today, finally. I flipped through them all only once. No going back and forth ruminating like I used to do. I laughed. I was dumbstruck and angry with my own ignorance and audacity. With the last journal, I cried again, but the sensation reading those words again wasn't as painful as I expected it to be. I only felt an outsider's pity, instead of self-pity. Then I ripped all these pages and stuffed them down the shredder.\n\nSymbolically, I don't see this destruction as a denial of what I did around others, and what happened to me. Because no matter what, those will stay in my memory. However, all those journals being physically existent were like an anchor, making those memories tangible and something that held puppet strings over me, instead of me being the puppetmaster, if you will.\n\nYes, a bunch of the better childhood memories I logged down are now physically gone. Yet again, so are all the horrible ones. And luckily, I do have photograph evidence of the sunnier days during those years, even when my journaling couldn't reflect them. That seems to be how I want to regard them now.\n\nI don't know what I thought I would gain by keeping the journals even after stopping my writing. It might've been some perspective, it might've been closure from the other people involved. I got neither. I empathized with all my past selves, and also wanted to smack them. In the end, I don't think I learned anything new from them, except knowing the regret of actually getting ugly thoughts onto paper, and never reaching resolutions to those problems in real life. It was my own echo chamber.\n\nI honestly don't know where to go from here. I'm not sure about jumping back into documenting my thoughts since I know I'm still not in the best place. Mildly better than how it used to be, but at the same time, these days are a much different can of adulthood worms. On top of today's worries, I'm still plagued by some leftover insecurity and regret. As a person, I definitely feel less tolerant/patient for bullshit than I was in my teens and early 20s, almost to a level of blunt anger. :P But I'm still chasing improvement, very hard. I don't want the past to plague my late 20s and 30s. For now, I'm celebrating the feeling of cutting this rope as a first step. I'm still trying to figure out what it is or how meaningful it is, but a tiny part of me no longer feels held back by those journals.", "title": "I finally shredded my old journals"}, {"created_utc": 1613701424, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln4773/decided_to_quit_relationships/", "num_comments": 14, "score": 1, "selftext": "Some see this as a terrible thing but I see it as not having to worry about anyone else besides what\u2019s important and having my well-being intact.

I want to be a  good person - and I'm deeply, deeply afraid that this will somehow have  prevented that from being a possibility. I feel like I need to confess  this; this simply isn't the person that I want to be.\n\nWhen  I was seventeen years old, I catfished someone. This was only for the  duration of one day, but that is hardly an excuse. This was done over  Twitter, and while I deleted the account after one day, I am still  haunted by what I have done. I've never done this again, either, but  this, too, is not an excuse.\n\nI'm  not even sure selfish is enough to cover how heinous this was; I feel  like I manipulated a person and toyed with them. Not only that, but my  wrongdoing has had two victims: the person I catfished directly, and the  person whose picture I used. That's one of the things that terrifies me  the most - that I could have very well hurt people in my doing this. It  was pathetic to have ever done this to start with. I regret it all, and  I'm sick that I ever even did it. I want to be better, and I don't want  to have the slightest thing to do with the person that did that.\n\nThere was a brief time when I attempted to brush this off. To try and ignore  the fact that I did this; the fact that it was in the past, I thought,  would have been enough. This lasted for a couple of months after the  fact, but once I started to realize the depths of this, and of how bad  it was, I've been depressed to varying lengths since then, with the  worst period being throughout the latter half of last year.\n\nI  am afraid of being an absolutely shitty person. An evil, toxic person.  And that's not the kind of person I want to be. I'm desperately afraid  of disappointing the people I love, and I don't want to let them down. I  deeply regret every moment of it, because in my doing this, I violated  trust and personal boundaries, I deceived and lied. I want to be a  better person than this, and while it scares and mortifies me that I  ever did this to start with, I feel like I'm split in two; like the part  of me that ever wants to do good and the part of me that's trying to  grow and change is a 'fake'. I'm scared of being a manipulator, or  deceitful, or predatory.\n\nOther  people have more or less told me to try and get over this, but I am  petrified. Petrified of being evil. I've talked with other people about  this, and whether or not I should reach out to the people that I've  mentioned earlier. They've said that it would probably be wiser to move  on, and to let them live their lives in peace, and this brings me to my  next point.\n\nI have been trying to  make changes in my life; to be more accepting of myself and more  confident in my identity, which was in great part what led me to twitter  to do this to start with. But I'm scared, too, that this is an  impossibility, and that I really won't be able to grow from this, and  instead that I'm always going to be the weirdo that did this. It scares  me - I don't want to be a predator, or a manipulator, or a creep. I'm  constantly afraid that I'm truly and genuinely evil, and that any  goodness that I could do or any growth I could make would simply be  false, or always undermined by the fact that I did this.\n\nCan  I ever move on or grow from this? Do I deserve to? I want to make  things right as best as I can, but I don't want to further make things  worse by bringing up something for people that may have very well have  moved on. While I truly and earnestly hope they have - to have hurt  anyone by doing this terrifies me - I feel guilty for trying to move on  all the same, and I feel like I need to face some kind of punishment. I  don't know what to do.\n\nDo I need  to tell my friends about this? Friends that I've had prior to this  happening. It makes me feel like a fraud when I talk to them, and I feel  like if they knew the 'real' me, the me that did this,  they'd cast me  off for good. And it would be entirely deserved.\n\nI've  been trying to grow, but I just don't know how to properly grow and  move on from this, and what steps I need to take to do this, or if I  even deserve to. I want to be a kind, and good person, and to help  people all I can. That I ever did this at all genuinely haunts me, and I  think about it at least once a day; many times I go on for several days  thinking about this and dwelling on it, and I feel like I deserve that.  That's what scares me.\n\nI just don't know what to do.

The question I often ask myself is how do you know when you have it?\n\nTrust me \u2013 I\u2019ve thought a lot of about this question and have taken action to seek answers. I\u2019ve done different things in my life in an attempt to answer it. I\u2019ve worked as an analyst, volunteered in NGOs as an English teacher, read an array of self-help (finally realising they say the same thing: just effing do it!), travelled extensively. I even booked a week\u2019s worth of annual leave to find the answer. I mean\u2026wtf\u2026really? Who does that?! Who uses annual leave to figure out their passion? Clearly someone hell-bent like me.\n\nEven when I was in Thailand, I thought I\u2019d get some guidance from talking to a Buddhist Monk in a monastery. That didn\u2019t go down so well when I realised that the monk was gay and was attracted to me \u2013 a straight male. He had his own issues since there\u2019s stigma of being a gay monk in a monastery. Long story short, I was the one who ended up giving advice to him. How ironic...\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know if other folks feel this way, but I get jealous of those who already know what their passion is (grrr! I envy you and at the same time happy for you that you are not dealt with the curse).\n\nI mean how is it possible that we go through education all the way up to university and we still end up confused? It makes me reflect on why I even became \u201ceducated?\u201d Was it only a means to conform to a system?\n\nI still feel there is a gap in our education system that\u2019s not correctly addressing the issues on the topic of finding passion and inevitably leading us to have this inner conflict (btw\u2026I haven\u2019t attended any educational establishments since 2008 so perhaps there may have been changes since then.)\n\nAnd so, In our quiet moments of contemplation (or even desperation), we get curious in seeking answers and hence we resort to the internet, blogs, online forums (cheers Reddit!). We gather, assimilate a whole range of perspectives coming from all over the world.\n\nNaturally, it\u2019s cost me time, money, anxiety, and sleepless nights. I guess it\u2019s all part of the journey. It\u2019s come to a point now where I\u2019d share what I\u2019ve learnt along the way. Below are some things that I\u2019ve learnt from direct experience on this topic.\n\nThe pressure of finding your passion is absurd. Who is to say that we should know the answers right away? For some reason, I think we\u2019ve been duped into believing that we\u2019re meant to know what our passion is overnight or in a few months. I\u2019ve come to realise that passion is more of an unfolding. The acorn doesn\u2019t become an oak tree overnight.\n\nA willingness to explore new things in the direction of your excitement or curiosity, or some feel good emotion. If something excites you, then act on that excitement. Words that have stuck with me are: \u201cfollow your highest excitement to the best of your ability with no expectation of the outcome\u201d. I\u2019ve always been curious about travelling, consciousness, and spirituality. The more I focused my energies in these areas, the more excited and intrigued I became.\n\nListen to your intuition. It\u2019s your unconscious communicating to your conscious mind. If you have a strong hunch about something, explore it with an open mind.\n\nShow some TLC to the 9-5. We all need to be practical and sustain our daily lives. We all know the regular 9-5 job has got some stigma around it. Yet, I take a different view. There are valuable skills we can learn like teamwork, communication, management, etc. Also, there were times where the 9-5 was exciting since the people I worked with were fun to be around (cracking lame jokes, socialising after work etc, creating good times). The people you work with can make a difference even if the work is mundane.\n\nSometimes in the 9-5, we can find stuff at work that captures our interest and puts us in a flow state, and passions blooms from there. From my experience, messing around with data and spreadsheets got me into that flow state (holla if you need excel help). When you do find your passion and decide to pursue it full time, then such skills from the 9-5 are useful.\n\nGet out of your head. I spent too much time thinking about stuff in my head, reading as much information I could. I even came full circle and noticed I was reading the same stuff all over again. Taking action and getting the first-hand experience of something gives better discernment if something vibes with you or not. So, if you\u2019re curious or excited about something, give it a go. In my experience, through taking action, I noticed my own inner conflicts and egotistical nature in my psyche. Taking action brings these conflicts from the unconscious mind into conscious awareness like a bubble rising up from the depths of the ocean. It makes us aware of all the emo stuff we need to deal with.\n\nEmbrace the mystery of finding your passion. The mystery of the unknown keeps us curious, keeps us seeking. I mean what would life be like if all the mysteries were solved? Sherlock Holmes wouldn\u2019t be needed, and on a sadder note, we wouldn\u2019t even get to say our favourite phrase *no shit sherlock!*\n\nWhat activities did you enjoy when you were a child during the imprint period (0-7 years)? This can shed some light. Playing with Lego was my thing. I would build houses, spaceships, cars, and megastructure\u2019s (then I would smash it all to pieces just for the fun of it). Putting things together and building things. I do the same thing as an analyst \u2013 it\u2019s just putting different data sets together and getting insights from the data. In a professional working environment, if I were to \u201csmash\u201d datasets to pieces, I would probably get fired (touch wood\u2026hasn\u2019t happened).\n\nBe mindful of social media and its affects. Not something new. We all know this intellectually. Yet, there can be repercussions on the mind at the unconscious level. For some people, it makes no difference, but for others it does. How you react is all that matters. I got content overwhelm\u2026sometimes I still do. I feel like the content out there of selling success in news feeds, insta posts, and blog posts; created more anxiety and a sense of urgency in finding the answer, stressing me out even more, as if it was a like some race to reach the end. But then I asked: why rush? I like instrumental music, especially when it\u2019s performed live in an orchestra.  There\u2019s form, elegance, and a beauty in it. The musicians are fully immersed, in the present moment, and enjoying the process. They are in no way rushing to the end (I mean\u2026can you imagine if they did? How effed up the music will sound!)\n\nI travelled for less than a year as this was something I really wanted to do. I longed for adventure, exploring, trying new foods, and learning about new cultures \u2013 all the things that got me excited and curious. I kept a travel journal to capture my memories, experiences, emotions, the highs, the lows, the people I met, and my thoughts. At the end of the trip, I wrote down my reflections on the whole journey, recounting all my learnings and experiences, and in my concluding paragraph, I ended it with the following phrase:\n\n*\u201cThe more you cling, the more you push it away, the more you let go, the more it comes back to you.\u201d*\n\nIt\u2019s like a paradox. A paradox will remain a paradox until you get a new perspective which breaks the illusion of the paradox (I feel this comes with experience in the playground of life. *Make sure you go on the monkey bars! mega lolz*).\n\nWhat the concluding sentence meant for me was this: let go of the clinging to the idea of finding your passion (I used to have this image in my mind where I imagine myself saying This is it with a feeling of elation!), or using the conscious, rationale mind to conform to your will.\n\nOnce you stop striving, the mental energy \u2013 that was one used to chase the image of you finding your passion and created by your ego or even defending your ego \u2013 has now been freed up. There is a kind of mental release, or a pressure off your shoulders. When that happens, consciousness works in mysterious ways and strangely enough when you let go of the need, you then start to see magic happen. Trust the process and have awareness as the events unfold in your life.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean to say not do nothing and expecting something will happen. Some form of action needs to be taken to kickstart the process. Otherwise, how will you know what you vibe with?\n\nI like to think that passion is not something sought overnight. Rather, it\u2019s something that it is grown just like the gradual blossoming of the lotus flower. Nature has a superior intelligence that we humans still can\u2019t fathom. Nature doesn\u2019t rush itself. The human organism is part of nature. Therefore: why rush - knowing that we are blossoming too.\n\nI hope these words find you well\n\nReflections from a seeker.\n\nIG: alwaysbeseeking", "title": "I'm done with finding my passion.

I used to be in a really bad spot, but now, I'm not. I wanted to share what helped me get through it, and hopefully, it will help you too. If it gets a good response I can share more.\n\nI used to, and still seldomly do, get incredibly hard on myself, hopeless, and really sad when I fail. If you're like me, it's partly because you want to be perfect. If you aren't perfect, then you're at risk of ridicule or being found out. Therefore, if you fail, even just a little bit, then **YOU** are a failure, and are at risk of being excluded. \n\nIf every time you fail, you are a failure, how do you think your behaviour will change?\n\nYou'll stop putting yourself in situations where you can fail because then there is no risk. You can never fail. However, now you can't succeed either. You're no longer willing to take risks because you might fail.\n\nI started to realize when my behaviour would change because I didn't want to fail. For example, I would stay in bed in the morning because I thought I enjoyed being in bed for a little longer. In actuality, I was delaying the start of my day because I was **scared**. I still do this, unfortunately, because it's so habitual.\n\nWhat I did, and what I am still doing, is first, recognizing where my fear is controlling my behavior and then slowly but surely, familiarize yourself with it. It will be scary, and hard. But once you start to think that, 'Hmm, maybe that wasn't so bad', you'll slowly become less afraid as you expose yourself more and more.\n\nEventually, since now you are risky again, you **WILL** fuck up. And honestly, it will probably suck. You might plunge back into a downward spiral again. You might fall back into bad habits. You might get a bad grade. But, maybe this time it won't be as bad? This time it's not as long, and not as intense. You can handle failure ever so slightly better than you did before. So you keep working, and you fail again. Maybe this time it only takes you three or four days to recover, and you realize where you went wrong. And eventually, after enough time, you can deal with most situations in your day-to-day life. This is what you want. It takes a *lot* of time to fix this behaviour. It's habitual. It will take longer than you think, and you won't even realize how much progress you've actually made until you think, 'Yenno, maybe things are doable? I'm going to be okay'.\n\n**EVERYONE** fails. Successful people (mostly, there are outliers) are the people who have failed the **most**. They've learned how to fail efficiently, and how to quickly turn it around. It's important that you view your failure as a time to learn. Figure out what went wrong, and how to go about it in the future. Don't be too hard on yourself when you fuck up. Remember, this behaviour takes a long time to change. You might be viewing yourself on a two week timescale, when you actually need to view yourself on a one or two **year** timescale. You'll then realize how much progress you're actually making.\n\nYou're never going to fully get rid of the feeling, deep, deep down, that you're a farce, a failure. But you can choose to not listen to it. You can choose to not let it dictate your behaviour. \n\nStay safe everybody, much love.", "title": "How to be OK with Failing"}, {"created_utc": 1613674977, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lmucjx/no_motivation_or_energy_for_anything_anymore/", "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm not really sure what to say. \n\nThrough COVID, It seems that every day of my life is the same, and the only way to actually feel happiness is to get high at the end of every night.

I see people post some truly hard to read stories and talk about the steps they have taken. I\u2019ve seen posts about things as menial as remembering to brush teeth everyday. I often shake my head and count my blessings .\n\nThe last year of my life has been a personal journey. I got divorced. Lost, what some would call, an extreme amount of weight in the time frame. And most importantly I\u2019ve been working on my mindset. Confidence. Discipline. Self love. \n\nI trimmed out things in my life that hurt me more than helped me. Gaming every free second of the day. Social media consumption, way way down. People who are negative, see ya.\n\nI\u2019ve become a mental rock and often don\u2019t even recognize the mental voice in my head.\n\nBut yesterday my training failed me.\n\nI\u2019ve always struggled with anxiety and stress when things don\u2019t go according to plan. Even more so when I am looking forward to an event and something comes up that delays me from the thing I am excited about.\n\nCut to yesterday. It\u2019s been snowing a lot and my gym has been closed. I haven\u2019t seen most of my friends in a few days and I also hadn\u2019t got my post workout hit in days. I was pretty excited about it. 10 minutes before I leave work my boss comes over and has one of those deep discussions that take forever. Next thing I know I\u2019m 30mins past when I wanted to leave. No big deal. Little annoyed, but putting in quality face time with the boss is never a bad thing.\n\nSo I leave work. Have to pickup my dog from daycare. I get hung up in the melting snow. A kind stranger drives by, has a shovel, 10mins later I\u2019m out. I thank him and the karma gods for the assist.\n\nOk, gonna be a little late. No big deal. Text the group and tell them what happened. Within seconds I get 5 messages saying they will save me a spot and get me setup. \n\nGet home. Get the dog situated and gym clothes on. Get hung up again less than a mile from my front door. This is where I absolutely lost it. \n\nPanic. Fomo. Sadness. Crushing weight on my chest. Can\u2019t think straight. I spent 5 mins digging snow with my hands. Didn\u2019t help. Took a deep deep breath. Got in my car, literally backed up a foot and got out of the snow.\n\nMade it to the gym. Had an awesome time. I got home after and really reflected on the build up and subsequent freak out.\n\nWhy? What was so bad that I felt the need to get so out of control? Nothing. Some old  ways of thinking resurfaced and my improvements in the last year cracked a bit. Here is the positive takeaway. \n\nTwo years ago a day like that would have crippled me for a month. I would have indulged in some terrible food and sit on my butt feeling sorry for myself. And to make myself feel better I would have doubled down on the food. I would have made excuses for myself and accepted defeat.\n\nToday though I can write down what happened, take a look at it, shake my head, wad it up, and toss it in the trash. \n\nMental health is not a object we can buy. It\u2019s not something you can just decide to be at any given moment.\n\nIt\u2019s a muscle that requires exercise every single day. \n\nSometimes we get injured and need medication to get better. I\u2019ve been on pills. Don\u2019t need them anymore. I see a therapist every other month. It used to be every other week. \n\nTo work that muscle I read books about success and self improvement. I write in a journal when something stumps me. I browse Reddit and other sites for a break. For inspiration. For motivation.\n\nI never stop adding to the things that make me better. \n\nAnd that is deciding to be better.", "title": "Yesterday I cracked"}, {"created_utc": 1613668135, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lmrmce/how_do_i_find_my_passion/", "num_comments": 16, "score": 1, "selftext": "Pretty straight forward question with a probably very difficult answer.

Sleeping on time instead of 3AM is so much better. I woke up feeling refreshed. Did my morning chores and told myself I would just check my phone for just 10 minutes. It ended up being 60 minutes. I could feel the guilt and regret surfacing on my mind. A feeling telling me I won't be able to change and this is who I am- a person who can't show discipline and determination. I took several deep breaths,acknowledged these feelings, opened the window that lit the room and started studying. I studied for an hour and took a 5 min break that changed into a 20 min break. Honestly how that happens every single time? I am shook. Took  deep breaths again, listened to a song,  told myself why I have to study and got back to studying for an hour. I was feeling lazy to exercise but I thought just exercise for 20 minutes if not more, Don't break the streak of daily exercise. So I did my work out.It was not as intense like yesterday but I am glad I did it. I had this realisation while I was exercising-\" I was always so repulsive of discomfort, pain and uneasiness while I workout or study that I always run away . I guess it's the price we all have to pay to accomplish things and to be in control of ourselves. When I feel the urge to watch a video instead of studying and I say I will not watch the video then I feel this discomfort and kind of pain that I give up and watch the video but now I will endure it. I want to be my own master and not a slave to my urges\". I had my lunch while watching a show. I watched one episode and I wanted to stop but end up watching one more. Then I wanted to watch another one so badly but I stopped. I was like no no no no no. I told myself- \"I am not going to let these urges control me. I am not watching another episode untill I studied for 4 hours. I want a lifestyle where I am allowed to take a break and then get back to work. I don't want to binge watch with guilt or work with stress at the last minute. I want a happy balanced way of working and enjoying things. I will do that \". But as I rejected the urge to watch another episode I felt some pain, some uneasiness. I reminded myself it's a wave and it will pass. I didn't have to ride it. Let it pass. As I was sitting down to study for 4 hours I knew it's going to be challenging and painful and boring but I was ready to endure all that.  I though  \" I am not a snowflake that can't endure a little discomfort, I am a tough bitch and I am going to handle this shit\".\nAs I was studying after 2 hours my productivity was not so good. I was not understanding things clearly and that was making me annoyed. Also my family members were distracting me, so during my 3rd hour I was feeling this session is going wasted but I reminded myself that to get better at studying first I have to overcome the bad phase. It's not like one day I will wake up and understand everything. I reminded myself the point is to continue doing it despite of all these urges and temptations. And so I continued.  In the evening my parents taunted me for having no backup option and putting my career in such situation and said I should have gone for a safer route instead. Well I have got extremely better at dealing with my parents from past 2-3 months and their views about my life  is not a problem anymore to me.But my brother is struggling a lot to study and he is totally out of motivation for his upcoming exams. That is stressful for me as he is not ready to endure the initial pain and always run away when made to study.  I am trying to figure out some way for him. \nNevertheless I continued  to study and completed my 4 hours and then I had a urgent  live lecture to attend so I end up studying from 3-9pm. Honestly after this I felt so good that I didn't even want to watch another episode. Instead I studied for 1hour more. \n\nIt is due to two reasons. First, I have done a lot damage to myself and right now it's imperative for me to perform my best.\nSecond, after saying no to that another episode, after doing my exercise today and after studying for those 4 hours when I didn't want to, I felt resistance every time and it was uncomfortable to me but  I did it despite that. It has made me realise that our urges and temptations won't kill us, like in those moments we feel so uncomfortable and want to abandon the work but if we don't pay attention to these urges and continue then all the discomfort and pain will eventually stop. All these urges can do is make us feel that little pain when we reject them but that's that. They can't do anything else. If we don't listen to them they will eventually stop. The power lies in us and not in them. \nAfter 6 months of trying and failing and trying and failing today I am feeling that lost spark in me. The spark that I am in control of myself . I am feeling powerful.  The only power these urges have was the uneasiness they make us feel and now I am no longer afraid of that uneasiness so basically my urges can't control me now.

During our six years, we had many good times, life experiences and memories built, though we were unhappy for the most part. We had many differences in terms of comparison and compatibility. The relationship was going to end anyways. So, the way I left my boyfriend was absolutely horrible and I didn\u2019t realize it until now.\nSo, we broke up. I can\u2019t remember details, but I remember time and time again I expressed \u201cI\u2019m not happy\u201d and I was the issue in that relationship. I would always be looking elsewhere for attention. This was not his fault, but my own. I became very toxic and selfish. I loved him, but the relationship wasn\u2019t going anywhere and it never would have. So, we broke up and this poor guy begged for me back, I never validated his feelings I would give him one worded answers. He was confused as to why I didn\u2019t want to fix anything. I just kept saying \u201cwe had six years\u201d and what not. So, as all of this was happening I had a friend in the process (met him for about a year) this guy is and was awesome. We spent a lot of time together talking (I worked at a restaurant and he would always come see me) so, over time we began talking and enjoying each other\u2019s company. \nLet\u2019s go back a minute. At first, with my ex partner I explained I just needed a break and time away, and that time turned into longer. During this time, I was spending time with my friend. Nothing, absolutely nothing was going on at the time. I knew it hurt my ex though, he had no idea what was going on. I literally broke his heart so badly. Eventually, I had to get my things from my exes house and we both cried, we cried many times together it was sad. \nSo, he tried to kiss me and I pulled away. I didn\u2019t want to be with him, not in the moment. I don\u2019t know if I was just wanting to move on, I don\u2019t know I didn\u2019t feel the connection we once had. I just felt nothing.\nI do wish I could go back into that moment sometimes.\nSo, I left. We cried.\nTime goes on, not a lot but some and I started of course, sleeping with my friend. The sex was awesome we had a lot of fun. Some days I felt we were lacking a connection. Not intimacy wise, but sometimes I didn\u2019t feel appreciated and what not. I\u2019d ask him a lot of times \u201cwhy do you like me?\u201d Like I was just craving his attention and needing his reassurance. Not good, I know. \nI had moments of weakness, it would come in waves and I\u2019d cry feeling sad thinking \u201cdid I make a mistake?\u201d Or \u201cI should of treated my ex better\u201d and this and that all these anxieties and sadness. Yet, I just pushed it all away to the side. Continued my relationship with my new person. It was so fast though, like way too rushed. We started to slow it down a bit, he was telling me he loved me so early on and I was too, though this wasn\u2019t true. I loved the idea of him, I wasn\u2019t in love with him at the time, it was too much. As time went on, I did grow a life for him though. But, in the back of my mind was my ex. My new partner and I did a lot of awesome things together and really enjoyed each other\u2019s company. In the midst of all of this though my ex and I were on and off in contact. Sometimes sad, angry or happy, we were just always in contact. \nTime goes on, I need to go to his place to drop off more things and at this time I found out he was sleeping with our mutual friend (we all have a common friends group) and I felt so angry and hurt, etc. \nThis was a poor reaction. I left the relationship and I moved on quickly and I treated my ex like garbage. \nSo much pain started stemming within me. So, after I got my things then I was the one who tried to hug and kiss him, which was wrong. It like, as soon he didn\u2019t want me for good then I wanted him. That\u2019s not love, that\u2019s emotional abusive behaviour. I know. \nDuring this time, me and my new partner were still spending time together and I did explain to him what happened.\nSo how was I able to tell someone I love them, but also try to kiss my ex? I\u2019m a serial monogamy monster, in my books.\nMy ex would message me things that he was angry about and vice versa. \nSo, after I learned more about my ex and his new fling. I continued to have episodes of saddens and jealously. I was comparing myself and my relationship to theirs. I was constantly seeing their online active fb status, I work by his house so I would even drive by there at times. Trying to convince myself they are just fuck buddies, blah blah and me and my new partner have something new and better. \nTime goes on. I\u2019m with my new guy, and he\u2019s with her. I continued to analyze and question everything. I started to feel myself pull away from my new partner and be more drawn to my ex. I\u2019d send him messages apologizing because I felt so fucking guilty for my past behaviour. I told him I did love him and always will. In a sense of, we had six years together. I felt guilty. At times, I\u2019d mention things about my new person and he\u2019d mention things about his. \nI realized during a lot of my new relationship I would talk about my ex a lot and this guy was getting so fed up. I kept convincing myself of our story (me and new guy)\n\u201cWell, we were friends, I was bound to leave my ex at some point or he\u2019d leave me, I have something with my new person\u201d and so forth.\nThe more their relationship progressed, the more I also wanted mine to (you see rushing into it) and I just wanted everyone to like my new person, our friends, my family, etc. I felt so much anxiety like, I wanted our friends group to stay the same and it was okay we were with other people. \nThe only time I really sent my ex those messages was when I knew he was moving on. He told me \u201cyou have no idea what I went through. I never talked to anyone about it, nobody knew how I felt.\u201d He also explained to me that \u201cyou need to stop fishing for information, people are getting tired of hearing about us and it\u2019s rude to talk about each other. I don\u2019t talk about you.\u201d And he also mentioned that he also \u201csecond guessed\u201d himself with his new person and had a \u201cmelt down\u201d \nAnyways.\nWe sent messages back and forth for months. We both knew it was wrong and disrespectful and we wouldn\u2019t move on properly this way.\nThe friends we have knew about my relationship and knew about theirs (the new person for him was already in the friends group so it was more normal for them to be around together) \nI felt a sense of jealously because I just wanted to feel welcome too, though nobody literally NOBODY cared about us breaking up/dating other people but I made it something because I was always asking questions about them, which people got tired of. So I stopped.\nSo, eventually I had a full blown melt down. I had not slept for three days, eaten or anything and I was at work (I drive a lot for my job) and I ended up randomly going to my exes house who I have not seen for four months. It was so stupid, I instantly regretted it. I just wanted to run as soon as I was there.\nHe let me in, we talked and I just cried and apologized and said \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry I regret this all\u201d and he said \u201cI feel angry towards you. It all just takes time, I will always have a love for you. But, embrace what you have with him and I will do the same with her.\u201d\nI began asking questions about his relationship, which was wrong and telling him things about mine, which was also wrong (he did ask a few questions too) and I just felt so pathetic and anxious and when I was in there, I just wanted to run home to my new person.\nSo we talked for a bit and I apologized for everything. I just needed to forgive myself and have him forgive me. I clearly wasn\u2019t over the relationship, the normal relationship I chose to leave.\nHe told me though we would have broken up anyways, over and over again. \nAt this time, me and my new person moved in together it felt right at the time.\nAfter I left the house...\nI just felt like a release like okay, it\u2019s done finally done. But, our mutual friends knew about what happened. My ex told his new girlfriend (he told me he wasn\u2019t telling her we were talking consistently and he needed to be honest, and I agreed I told him I\u2019d tell my new person but I told him I was scared what our friends will think) \nSo, one of our mutual friends (also the owner of the restaurant) and I had plans, then she post poned them and asked me to come in to see her.\nSo I did. \nI went there, full of anxiety and she told me over and over again.\n\u201cYour job will always be secure here, we all love you and you need help. Nobody wants to hear about this anymore. It\u2019s draining, you need to drop it and move on. Let your new person love you. I like him and you\u2019re always welcome. I want the old you back. I want the person where we can sit and have drinks, or play cards not this. I don\u2019t want our friendship to be based on this. You\u2019re acting crazy, going to his house asking for forgiveness, etc\u201d \nThen another friend of ours said the same thing basically \u201cof course we like your new person, but you need to be committed to him. We aren\u2019t sitting here talking shit about you, but you need to forgive yourself, you need to get better, let it go and come back.\u201d Though, I believed them. I felt also, they were pushing me away, and when I talked to one of them she said \u201cyou\u2019re not wrong, you\u2019re going to push your friends away if you keep acting like this. You two were not good together, this doesn\u2019t go back to you two it goes back on you. You need to get better.\u201d Everyone just kept saying that....which I understand. What I\u2019ve done to my new person is so wrong, I am contributing toxic and unhealthy traits in this relationship. Since all of this, I have pushed him away too, he says it\u2019s getting too hard and won\u2019t even have sex with me anymore. We always had more than sex, but everything is lacking now. Our connection, happiness, everything. I had a mental break down and he had to take me in for help. I felt so so pathetic, worthless and lonely. \nWhen I asked what was being said about me with our friends group, I was told \u201cnobody cares as much as you do, we all just want the old you back and it wasn\u2019t cool what you did\u201d but I still think they are sitting there calling me a loser and that they don\u2019t want me around etc. \nWhat bothers me the most is that my ex and his new SO are hanging out there all the time, and all is good. That\u2019s how it was for me and my new person, but since my episode nobody wants me to be around for awhile. \nThey don\u2019t reply to my messages, or they short answer me and say \u201cI\u2019m busy, talk later\u201d I know I\u2019m acting incredibly insane and inappropriate especially since I LEFT HIM. I sometimes think, I made a huge mistake and I lost all my friends in the process. I could have handled this so much differently. I don\u2019t know how to forgive myself, and how to have my friends forgive me either. I know life will never be the same, this is a new reality for me. \nPeople said they are done hearing me apologize and they said you are always welcome but need to be better. \nSo, at this point I feel worthless and sad, because everyone chooses to be around the two of them, and not me but I understand that, because I am the only being annoying and frustrating. Plus they were both already in the friends group. My new person knew them yes, but wasn\u2019t really close with any of them. \nI don\u2019t know how to get better.\nMy life is upside down, a fucking nightmare. I did this to myself, and for what? To be with someone who was fun, new and exciting when really I could have just stayed in that stagnant relationship (most people I\u2019ve spoken to tell me how unhappy we were for years) and I do agree with them, but I keep seeing it through rose pedal glasses. \nSo. I decided to take a LOA from work, go home (up North) for five weeks, be alone and be single since I\u2019ve already ruined my relationship with my new partner. All my fault, because he is awesome and deserves love and he did really love me and fully accepted me; although, he shuts down and has a hard time expressing his emotions....and I am very emotional \nIf I was happy with my ex, why was I always looking elsewhere? If I was happy with my new partner, why was I reliving the past? \nI don\u2019t know how to fix any of this, I need to get better, I need to change. I know I am reading into everything far too much. I know what people are saying or have said. But, in my reality, in my side I had a mental break down and went there to talk and apologize. I\u2019m not sure exactly what was said, but that\u2019s the only reason now my friends are pushing me away because they are tired of my behaviour, etc. \nSo, if I leave them alone for a few weeks and come back will it be better? If I prove myself, own to my mistakes and be more kind and be a better friend opposed to just using them as a sounding board.\nWhat do I do about my new person? We\u2019ve talked about it and think it\u2019s best to stay away for awhile, try to rebuild what we have, let me move from my past and fall in love like really fall in love again.\nI miss my fucking life, I want to be normal. I am ashamed and depressed. If I was happy with my new person, why did I suffer so bad from anxiety and depression from my past?\nMy therapist knows all of this and is actively trying to work with me. \nI know, I\u2019ll be able to go back to work, and be around people although, I don\u2019t know how to prove myself. To be forgiven. \nI know people will remember my actions but I want them to know it\u2019s not who I am. \nI need help.\nI just feel so empty inside.\nI rushed all of this too quickly, I jumped before I could swim, I\u2019ve hurt my ex, my new person and I currently damaging the friendships I had. \nI know that, if they wanted to really write me off, they would and they could. I\u2019ve seen it happen before. But, they are being as gentle as possible with me.\nPlease.\nListen and help me.\nI know I\u2019m a piece of shit human. I get that, that\u2019s what I\u2019m working on. I need to be better. I need to get better. \nI just can\u2019t stop reliving the last few months in my head over and over.\nThank you If you got this far.\n\nTL;DR\n\nHow do I become better?

And that I should always remember Santiago.\n\nWhen I started university, I was severly depressed and anxious, and I was desperately looking for a way\u00a0out. One of those days, I came across your book \"Aleph\" in the library. I remember getting very excited because the man behind The Alchemist had written a book where the protagonist was a Turkish girl like me. And her name was \"Hilal\", which happens to be the synonym of my name.\n\u00a0\nA few years went by. When I was 21, I decided to go on a journey to California. I only asked for healing from that trip. I decided to go there to meet my spiritual teacher who had been an amazing guide, friend and almost a father to me for about 4 years.\u00a0I was certain if I'd found a way to get to him, my issues would have magically dissolved.\n\nI arrived. After a couple of days, I discovered a book lying apart on a shelf. The colorful cover and the familiar name Paulo Coelho immediately grabbed my attention: The Valkyries. I remembered Santiago- with his relentless desire to see the world and find his treasure.  Now I was in Los Angeles looking for MY treasure.\n\nThe Valkyries was a book about connecting to your angels. And in those days, I was frantically looking for them. The book revolves very much around you and your master 'J', which also happens to be the initial of my spiritual guru in Los Angeles-Joseph. What's more, I had discovered the book just a few days before my road trip to Las Vegas, going through the Mojave Desert- the desert where the Valkyries lived. \n\nThere was so much synchronicity.

The reason I didn't want to post this on my main account is because people already worry about me enough because I'm physically disabled and I don't like to worry people. So, if you're an irl friend, I love you, and I appreciate you, but don't let this become bigger than it is \\*JUST\\* because of that.\n\nSo I suppose the TRUE reason is because I worry about others before myself to the point of making them feel like I'm secure in happiness. I'm not. Not right now. But I will be. I just need some direction beyond therapy as I'm starting that soon.\n\nThe disability I have is called Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It weakens my muscles over time and amazing enough, I'm beyond lucky to receive a really expensive treatment for it. So my physical health has never been better. My mental health, not so much.\n\nI make a TON of jokes about my disposition, and when my anxiety doesn't get the best of me, I even get paid to do it! I've always been in really good spirits about it. Even as I type this. I'm not necessarily saddened by the things that I'm about to say, but FUCK ME NOT RUNNING because these things make my situation very restricted in terms of options to cope. In essence, \"The Book\" isn't written for folks like myself.\n\nI can take it. I've been through some real crazy shit, and the posts on this account only scratch the surface. So. For the first time in my life, I'm depressed. Let me rapid fire some bullet points as to why I feel like I can't participate in the \"normal\" ways of coping.\n\nFirst one is actually evident by this post. It's really hard to admit this to anyone but a very select few. When you're depressed, you need a friend who can drag your ass into productivity. Here's the part that people simultaneously do and don't realize about disability. Hell. I make a ton of great jokes about this. But this is really, really bad for the same reason that it's pretty fucking sweet. Nobody expects anything from you. If you're watching YouTube for 14 hours a day, sleeping until 6pm,etc. Nobody really says anything about it. I'm 25 years old. It's not my parent's job to tell me what to do anymore, and as I'm getting older, it feels like they've felt like that since I was a kid because \"quality of life\". I don't have ANY ill will towards that at all. My folks are great. But it has presented a really big problem. My discipline is shot to shit because I've fed the instant gratification monkey for so long. Here's a few things I'm starting to struggle with.\n\nI used to love writing so much that I habitually apologized for lengthy replies and I always messaged back immediately. I've been flat out ignoring messages and making this post is cathartic...but also a chore. It wouldn't have been a chore a few months ago. I was part of a local comedy showcase (2 hours. My spot was a ten minute set) and I sold 10 out of roughly 40 total tickets in 3 days with little advertising. My anxiety and/or depression won. It made all of the inconveniences (travel, weather, etc) bigger and bigger, more and more reasons not to go by the minute. So I didn't. Nobody but me lost money for that otherwise I absolutely would have followed through, but more out of commitment honestly. The YouTube and sleeping until 6pm wasn't hyperbole. I have no real schedule to lean into\n\nBullet points starting now, but as a trigger warning, one is sexual which I'll put first. I'm not shy about questions either, but if you wonder why I can't do whatever I'm listing, it's probably due to not being physically strong enough. \n\nEverything functions fine, but I'm not physically strong enough to do the five knuckle shuffle. A little bit of 5 on 1. Some activation of the baby batter blaster. A good ol fashioned tussle with the love muscle. \n\nI can't yell. Scream. Punch a wall. Go for a jog. Leave the room to absolutely lose my shit in private. Lose my shit in the shower. The list goes on.\n\nSo! Maybe you guys would be able to help me think of some alternatives. I am on Lexapro 10mg. Curbs my anxiety, but as I experience depression for the first time in my life, I really can't tell if it's caused by the Lexapro, COVID blues, and/or recent family tragedies.\n\nAt the end of the day, I really NEED to do better. Be better. Because sure. Friends can drag you out, but that only works for so long. I could ask one of you to \"force\" me to do stuff (same issue there, plus I COULD choose to ignore it) or I can have this conversation with my folks. My mom recently lost her father, so it'd have to be a very lite version. Other than those, I really can't think of anything else, but hopefully you guys can help me come up with some ideas like SOMEHOW using positive reinforcement/delayed gratification that I can't bypass. Therapy is absolutely the priority, because I know I probably overshared a bit, but in being thorough, I'm hoping you guys can help me out with a stopgap until I can start therapy. I'd be down for an accountability buddy\n\nAgain, this is 100 percent not a pity post. I hate that. Suffering is not and should not ever be a dick measuring contest. We all have our issues, and none of us can ever claim someone else has it worse or better. We all have our shitty cards in the deck. Some of mine are just a bit more visible is all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My disability throws out a lot of the playbook on coping methods.

And then it struck me.\n\nWhy am I engaging with this man? I had to literally see a therapist because he hurt me so bad! Same for the ex that I have been struggling to get over for the past two years.\n\nFrom here on in, I refuse to engage with men who hurt me. Men who hurt me enough that my self-esteem was so low that I had to go to therapy to pick back up the pieces. What good person would do that to someone else? Not anyone I want to be with, that's for sure.\n\nAnyway, it's small, but I am super happy and I think a lot of people might benefit from this mentality so I wanted to share.\n\nTo note, there is nothing wrong with therapy. I love therapy. I just don't think people that make you seek therapy are people who should be in your life.\n\nTL;DR - The takeaway: I refuse to engage with any man who hurt me bad enough to need to seek therapy for it.

Do not comment or post negativity for negativy\u2019s sake, ever.\nThere\u2019s really no reason to elaborate because I cannot phantom a reason what good can come from that. You already know this to be true. \n\n###2. Do not correct people.\nYou can justify to yourself that correcting people under the guise of stopping misinformation from spreading\u2014also coined \u2018calling someone out\u2019 by certain activists\u2014is the moral thing to do, but it\u2019s a futile cause: there is simply too much to correct. If it truly were a moral cause it would be your vocation. You would go at it systematically and you would be keeping statistics. You don\u2019t. You were just caught up in the moment and you wanted to best your opponent. And besides, who are you to appoint yourself arbiter of Truth? Nobody voted for you to be the Savior of naive people anyway. Let them believe what they want to believe, they have their own path to follow. You will either most likely won\u2019t convince the other party, or you help create a culture where people will now be less inclined to speak their mind. Part of being wise is having the ability to simply let people be wrong. This rule is based on something a certain someone said: he mentioned he only started having really good conversations and learning from the other party when he stopped trying to ***convince*** people. It\u2019s a mindset rather than a method and it will help prevent you from falling into the trap of arguing, which brings me to my next rule.\n\n###3. Do not argue.\nBecause people who argue want to win. This way of conversing changes the way you interpret what the other says and what you want to hear. You are now on the offence and want to outsmart the other. It changes what you say and how you say it. You\u2019ll find yourself setting traps disguised as questions and be snarky about it too. And besides, when exactly was the last time you\u2019ve won an internet argument? Exactly, never. Converse rather than debate. Talk instead of argue. \n\n###4. Do not let yourself be baited.\nSay what you have to say and leave it at that. Don\u2019t reply to replies, don\u2019t go having multiple threads. I\u2019ve seen this many times in threads. A person gets a negative comment and immidiately replies \u2018to set the record straight\u2019. Obviously it didn\u2019t work because the other person replied and moved the goal post. Of course this needs to be corrected too in the next reply. Soon others will post similar comments, and the OP\u2014with palpable annoyance\u2014will soon find himself in an ongoing battle replying to everyone while adding that he already addressed this and that issue in this and that thread. He\u2019s now having twelve conversations and is visibly getting exhausted. He\u2019s not convincing anyone. If you have some experience with the comment culture on Reddit (or any other social media platform for that matter) then you will notice something. Some people\u2014musicians, politicians, artists, performers, actors, professionals\u2014seem to have mastered the art of One Post or One Comment. They somehow say what they want to say and that\u2019s it. They don\u2019t reply when people comment on their post, and when they leave a comment or reply somewhere they don\u2019t reply to that one either. Well, there is a lesson in there.\n\n###5. Do not defend yourself or others.\nAnother thing I\u2019ve seen many, many times, is someone defending themselves or others. You might say \u201cWell hey, what\u2019s wrong standing up for yourself?\u201d Nothing, but as I discussed in rule 4, just say what you have to say and leave it at that. Doing this takes some time because you need to learn how to properly formulate your thoughts. That doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore the replies. Read them and let the spirit of the comments inform the next time you formulate a similar thought. You\u2019ll get better at it each time you do this. Eventually you will stop feeling the need to \u2018defend\u2019 yourself. But what about someone else you say? Well, \u2018standing up for someone\u2019 in a Reddit thread usually means \u2018calling someone out\u2019. It\u2019s a wrong that needs to be righted. You may feel it\u2019s the right thing to do\u2014and in the right circumstances it certainly is\u2014but it reminds me of what a psychologist said when he mentioned something he learned from Jung. He said that the wrong thing to do as a paychologist was to hand someone the solution to their problem. What you want to do is hand someone the tools to generate their own solutions. Because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll end up being some sort of Deus Ex Machina and you\u2019ll rob your patient of their own agency. You may have solved their problem, but you didn\u2019t help them solve it themselves.\n\n###6. Do not downvote comments or posts.\nSimilar to rule 1\u2013do not comment or post negativity for negativy\u2019s sake, ever\u2014but less strict, so to speak. Yeah sure, sometimes a post shouldn\u2019t belong in a certain sub, but mostly you just pressed that downvote because you wanted to stick it to them. It\u2019s petty **and you know it**. You saw something you didn\u2019t like, so you pressed that downvote arrow. You felt a slight pang of righteousness when you did it too. You might check back sometime later to see if it gained even more downvotes so you can revel in your righteousness some more. You\u2019re still annoyed the posts or comment exists though. Thus, you gained nothing. You\u2019re probably going to be even more annoyed when you see another similar post. This time you\u2019re not letting the guy off with just a downvote, so you proceed to also post a negative comment. The guy responds, but he has the gall to move the goal post. What a dick. He needs to be called out. Can\u2019t let this shit stand, right? It\u2019s a textbook example of a negative feedback spiral. You\u2019re poking an angry finger at the World but the World pokes it right back at you. Fool.\n\n###7. Do not subscribe to content that makes you angry.\nKind of obvious, but being angry is counter-intuitively highly intoxicating and addictive. Ask yourself the next time you\u2019re  angry \u201cDo I want a solution or I want to stay mad?\u201d Exactly, you want to stay mad. A moment of moral invincibility. It feels good. Geniously concocted insults fly out of your mouth. Bring it. You can do this all day. But you ***know*** you shouldn\u2019t make a lot of decisions when you\u2019re angry, certainly not important ones. They\u2019re usually pretty short term anyway, but most importantly, decisions made when angry seldomly account for repercussions. Looking back, almost anything you ever did. anytime you were angry, you wished you didn\u2019t do. Or at least differently. If that doesn\u2019t convince you I don\u2019t know what will. So then, why should you willingly consume content that you know makes you angry? What good can that possibly do? Do the math, man.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI\u2019ve been guilty of all seven rules. Just saying. I learned them the hard way. Took a while too, I\u2019m stubborn. Had a few more rules but it\u2019s already a wall. But please do try \u2018em out. Just for a month.

I then began creating a story around the song and a music video in my head. My favorite thing to do was laying in bed, closing my eyes and letting the video play as if I was watching it. One song turned into a playlist (different artists but I imagined they were all by the same artist - me). I imagined myself as a better version of myself - more confident, handsome, outgoing, masculine, strong and courageous. The playlist had 35 songs and they were all part of one storyline.\nI just realized I have no idea how to actually explain this but it's like another world. There are people, all kinds of different characters. The main character (me but waaay better) goes through ups and downs and expresses all of them in his music. Sometimes I even cry or laugh alone while imagining this. If I could beam this whole \"movie\" into people's heads I'm sure they'd see just how cool it is but I have no way of explaining it - just experiencing it.\nI became addicted to this fantasy. I didn't want to do anything else. It came to a point where everything else in my life was just a distraction I had to get over and done with so I could go back to my fantasy. I failed 3 of my modules at University (I'm studying com sci). I just realized I have no friends here and only one friend back home whom I've never even called.

I always wanted to meet her.. I loved her.. I was broken into pieces.. I took me almost a months to recover to normal.\n\nCurrent story -\n\nJust right after my this above heartbreak I started talking to a girl on insta of my own country but living in a different city .. We became friends and then after 3 months she proposed me.. I told her that I had a horrible experience and these LDR doens't work and I'll be broken if it happens again that someone betrays me and separation comes without even meeting once in perosn... I was vocal about it but she made me trust her saying that this won't happen R trust me and all.. I told her that I'm vulnerable on that part and she was like it won't happen don't worry.. And i kept reminding her that time to time.. Then relationship started (on commitment that we will stay together until one of us get married) first year went good CALLS, TEXT, SKYPE.. we came so close.. Then after around one year her insecurities increased but fights started but as we were committed so stood there and we resolved the thing.. During this whole time I kept asking her meeting and she was always like I'm not comfortable.. We will meet don't worry.. I  kept asking and she kept avoiding.. So second year also passed and finally we decided in December 2020 that we will meet in June 2021 after 2.5 years but just after  15 days into 2021 she started ignoring.. I noticed.. But i thought that she's busy coz she recently joined some office for internship so I gave her space and i had exams too in Jan 21.. But i was feeling a change in her behaviour so on 6th i told her that things aren't same you are behaving differently.. Is there something and she's always like no there notning and it's just I'm so busy and all and Feb went like this only less communication..\nI again tried talking to her the same problem and she's again like no there's nothing.. Then March came and things kept going bad.. And again we talked about it and had a big fight and she told me \"I DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME FOR YOU ANYMORE\" and i said that we knew that this time will come and we discussed and we knew but we have a commitment..she told me that I need to change few things to keep this relationship working.\nI said I'll and I started working on them but there was no change in her behaviour even it was becoming worse and i was getting broken each second\n\nThen tomorrow we were on skype and she cut the call midway saying she'll call back in 2 minutes but she didn't I called back she was busy on another call I tried after half and hour she was still busy then I tried now her phone was switched off and I tried her second number and now she was busy again midnight.. I kept calling she picked and said its URGENT wait.. I did wait but she didn't told me what was urgency and later she was online all the time.. In the morning she said i'll call and tell you I kept waiting but she didn't call.. In the eve afyer her office hours I called she was busy on another call and told me to wait.. Then she called me back and we were talking but still she wasn't telling me the urgency she had and again she's like wait I'll call you in 2 minutes and I kept waiting she didn't.\n\nFinally I called her and asked her to tell me if there is something I won't get hurt and then she said \"OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOMEONE\" then I politely said who she said \"I am telling it want it a secret\" then I said that you did enough damage knowing everything about my emotions and it's the dead end.

To be more clear, I experience a great deal of insecurity around accomplished, skilled, or talented people, because I feel as though I am none of those things. I'm not talking about the skills and accomplishments that come with academic or professional success. I'm talking about the unique things that people have invested time in to develop as skills or hobbies.\n\nWhen I was a kid and adolescent, I had social anxiety disorder that was bad enough to make me afraid of participating in socializing with other kids. I also avoided doing things with my dad, as he had quite a temper that made me afraid of doing things incorrectly. I spent much of my early life playing video games and feeling safe. My social anxiety wouldn't get better until I was a teenager, but my fear of failure remained for long after that. As a result, I don't have a lot of thing that I can do for myself or for others.\n\nI don't play music at all, I don't know anything about sports, and I don't even know how to play card games, checkers, or chess. I don't speak any other languages, I don't know how to fix or build things, and I don't know how to work on mechanical things like cars or motorcycles. I'm 28-years-old, and I feel incredibly disappointed with the kind of person that I am. It feels worse around people who are adept at multiple different things. In these situations I start to feel inadequate, mediocre, useless, yearning for a thing I wish I could demonstrate skill in or feel proud as an action I could take right now.\n\nI've decided I need to take the route of developing myself as a person. I don't want to just cope with my inability and decide I shouldn't compare myself, because previous attempts at steering my thoughts this way fail to grapple with the reality of my social settings as a reference point and my genuine dissatisfaction with my skill level. \n\nHowever, I don't know what to pursue and develop. I don't think it's sustainable or wise to become involved in something strictly for the purpose of becoming good at it, but I also don't know how to tell the difference between me being genuinely interested in something or just interested in the idea of it. Some things I also don't think satisfy this need inside me. For example, cooking is something so basic and fundamental that I think most people should just know how to do it. Things related to my work just make me better at my job, which all comes down to being work at the end of the day. What I really crave is something objectively useful or beneficial to myself or people around me that makes me stand out from others and feel confident in who I am.\n\nWith this in mind, I'd like help discovering genuine interests and passions to pursue I'm curious if there is any real distinction with truly enjoying a thing as opposed to enjoying the idea of it, and wonder if anyone who's dealt with that can speak to telling the difference.

They wanted to operate quickly but we deferred it till after secondary school (probably a stupid decision in hindsight but I didn\u2019t want to fall behind). \n\nThis operation was around 13 hours long, and recovery almost a year. It was a dark time, and the best thing that ever happened to me. I reached my lowest point, both mentally and physically \u2013 but with pain comes change.\n\nI had plenty of nights where I'd cry from feeling low. I'd spend weeks wishing life was different. I'd hide in my room when my brother had parties because I was so unconfident. \n\nComing up to my operation I developed a Stoic attitude organically. I was so sick of worrying I persuaded myself there was no point. I think I wanted to reassure my mum. This idea that **nothing is worth responding negatively to** started as I was wheeled into the operating room. And it has defined my life since. \n\nThankfully surgery #1 went well. And after 5 months of 14 hours/day of WoW, I decided it was time to take control of life properly. \n\n# Finding fitness\n\nI think fitness is the seed of all excellence. \n\nBoy I got fat during the gaming times. The first diet was 50 pounds to lose. It wasn't easy. In fact, I put half of it back on after. But if you want to improve anything about yourself, start at the gym. The benefits aren't just physical. Everything is improved. Attitude, mindset, confidence. \n\nWhen you see what you can do for yourself physically with some consistent effort, you can apply the same philosophy to the mental crap you want to deal with. \n\nI had another operation a year later. 6 hours. My spine is made out of metal now (I'm like Wolverine but I can't grow a beard). But I've worked out ever since. \n\n# The Mental Game\n\nI got pretty heavy into philosophy and psychology after the operations. There was so much I disliked about my thought processes and confidence that I decided to tackle it one step at a time.\n\nI made a commitment to read every day. Workout regularly. And force myself to change. It started with mindset.\n\n**I had a massive fixed mindset**. \n\nAll the classic tell tale symptoms. I went to town on that sh\\*t. It wasn't easy, I still get it from time to time. But forcing yourself to enjoy challenges instead of hide from them, and to stop trying to look good and instead focus on *being good* is has been vital for my mental well being. \n\n**Confidence is fixable**. \n\nIt isn't easy, but that's not the same thing.\n\nFake it till you make it works. But not because you\u2019ve tricked everyone. Because you give yourself a chance to be someone you want to be.\n\nI used to look externally for my confidence. Status, money, popularity. But when I changed my attitude to embrace who I was, the rest was just time, and some awkward situations. \n\n**Humour helps massively.**\n\nOne perk of being a loser was I learnt the power of self-depreciation. It's the easiest type of humour, and completely disarming to people around you. You don\u2019t have to self-abuse (which I did when younger) \u2013 but the person who can laugh at himself no matter what is always well received. \n\nI still do to this day. It works well for my career, my attitude towards life, and helps through any anxious feelings. \n\n**The worst thing for anxiety is to listen to it**. \n\nIt took me a long time to internalise this. Anxiety triggers compulsive behaviour, which masks anxiety. It doesn't cure it.\n\nI would avoid so much due to it, even though the things I hid from are the things I wanted most. \n\nTo overcome anxiety I live by rules. Mainly one. If I found myself avoiding or lying through anxiety, I had to do exactly what made me scared.\n\nThese days my friends think I'm a very confident guy. Often, I just don't give myself the time to worry before I act. \n\n**Women aren't scary.**\n\nMy first year of Uni I kissed like 2 girls. And trust me, that wasn't for lack of trying. But I would self-sabotage better than a Russian spy.\n\nBy year 3, I had alright 'game', but terrible commitment issues. I had around 30 flings over 5 years, and was sober for 3 of them. I broke up with all of them. Compulsive behaviour again. \n\nThankfully I changed my outlook a couple of years ago. Again, I set a rule. No more drinking to meet women. No more pretending to be someone I wasn't. \n\nI opened up more, and let me tell you \u2013 it was the best decision ever. To find someone who loves you for you is an amazing feeling. I used to laugh at the idea of long term relationships. Now I realise it\u2019s a huge part of an amazing life experience.\n\n**Being depressed is tough, but it's your job to do something about it.**\n\nI've felt incredibly low at points. I understand how crippling it can be.\n\nFeeling sorry for yourself is poison. I know its a tough thing to say, but  there's something about it that keeps drawing you back in. Almost a guilty pleasure. \n\nThere was a year I used to go to bed each night and wish for bad things to happen. Like, I took joy from mentally picturing sympathy from others etc. I thought it was harmless behavior, but the way you think determines the life you live. \n\nYou have to choose to be happy. And that means taking action. Meditating, writing in a journal, exercise, nature etc. They all work if you commit to it. \n\n# Now each day moves me closer\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m conscious of your time. A quick summary of what\u2019s happening now. I recently went back to my old school, no one recognized me. Feelsgoodman. \n\nI\u2019m obsessed with long term progress. I love James Clear, and base pretty much my whole life on incremental efforts. \n\nFitness wise, I managed to get a 6 pack (now gone, enjoyed my lockdown way too much), and primarily weight train 5 days a week. I\u2019m 4 pull ups away from 20, which is funny because 10 years ago I almost cried when I done my first 1.\n\nRelationship wise \u2013 grateful to have a lovely girlfriend who is my lifelong partner. She's a proper sweetheart.\n\nAnxiety wise \u2013 pretty much gone. I\u2019d never say fully. Anxiety is like an annoying spot that keeps rearing its ugly head.  But it\u2019s about how you respond to it that makes the difference, and I never let it win. \n\nSuccess wise, I\u2019ve been a qualified Dentist for 5 years, and now work as a Cosmetic Dentist. It's a highly demanding job. I wouldn't have managed a day of it 10 years ago. Now I welcome it. \n\nBut I recently handed in my notice. My boss thought I was crazy, but I decided to take a risk and pursue writing. I want to challenge myself creatively.\n\nI've been writing for 6 months. I write an article a week no matter what, and it's been the biggest challenge yet. I wake up 3 hours early to write before work every day. September I'll have more time to focus on it. \n\nI won't post any links, but I write about motivation and building a strong mindset for long term progression. Genuinely love psychology and philosophy and I focus on combining it. I've only got 10 subscribers, but my friends tell me it's good. It's a start. \n\nI love the idea of committing to something for 10+ years. Writing is that thing for me. But if I didn't take the first steps and begin changing the fundamentals, I'd still be hiding in my hole of despair. \n\n# Final Thoughts \n\nI wanted to share this because I\u2019ve been very fortunate in my own transformation, and sincerely hope you guys will be too. There are a few things I live my life by now, and hopefully one of these thoughts resonates with some of you.\n\n1. You can always choose how to respond to any situation.\n\n2. Don\u2019t focus on the end goal. It can be depressing. Fall in love with the process of progress. Life is about the direction, not destination.\n\n3. Being able to laugh when times are tough is the ultimate reaction for a happy life.\n\n4. Being jealous of others isn\u2019t healthy. You should only complete with yourself.\n\n5. It doesn\u2019t matter about your start point, only that you\u2019ve started and that you're moving.\n\n6. Everything you dislike can be changed. Even if it can\u2019t, your perception of it can. Sometimes, you have to approach things one at a time. But life is a lot longer than we consider it to be, and what you can do with it is amazing.\n\n7. Don\u2019t be tough on yourself. You\u2019re the only person you spend all your own time with, might as well enjoy it.\n\n8. Be the person who deserves the life you want and it will come. This is true for careers and relationships. Work hard and treat people well. It's reciprocated. \n\n9. Don't hide your true character. The world is a large place, especially with the internet. Lean into what makes you unique. People resonate with it, and you build a friendship group/ support network based on sincerity and genuineness. \n\n10. The struggle is, and always will be, worth it. \n\n\\----\n\nAnyway, good luck to everyone on their own path. The decision to be better is nothing short of amazing, even if it's the hardest one you'll make. \n\nI'm hoping to keep up with like-minded people. I've been lurking for so long it's almost criminal.\n\nPeace out,\n\nKieran", "title": "10 years of progress - Complete transformation."}, {"created_utc": 1615829588, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m5q26j/how_do_i_become_more_trustworthy/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "Sorry for the block of text, I\u2019m on mobile and will break it up when I get home from work. I grew up isolated and indoctrinated to believe that no one outside of my home was trustworthy. i was \u2018homeschooled\u2019 and my ability to connect with others- adult or my own age- was severely limited to a circle my mother could control. However, I was unable to trust the people around me at home either. My mother created an environment that bred micromanaging and tattling and eventually resentment. I can\u2019t tell you when I stopped trusting my mother and older sister because there\u2019s been so many moments that proved I couldn\u2019t and forced me further into hiding myself, my interests, and my activities.

Living in the middle of \u2018trust no one who\u2019s not family\u2019 coming from my entire family and \u2018can\u2019t trust my family because I\u2019ll either get in trouble immediately or they\u2019ll hold my secrets over me\u2019 lead me to the logical but stupid way of thinking \u2018no one is going to trust me anyway, so why be trustworthy?\u2019. Bad idea. I\u2019ve done a lot I\u2019m not proud of that I won\u2019t get into here but essentially; I don\u2019t know how act trustworthy. A lot of my behavioral issues come as a trauma response (lying about lots of little things just to get thru the day easier, hiding broken things, not being honest about where self harm marks came from) and others are from lack of impulse control (I believe I have ADHD, I\u2019m currently being evaluated but it means sometimes I really don\u2019t know why I did that weird, kinda stupid thing) but I don\u2019t live in that house anymore so it just makes me look shifty to my partner. It also effects my ability to make friendships as I still don\u2019t trust people myself so I never know how much to tell people when we first meet and then I feel like I\u2019m kinda stuck in the \u2018polite, kinda formal, wouldn\u2019t leave them alone with my purse\u2019 zone. But like all humans, I want connections and trust and community. Since I can\u2019t get that from my bio family, I want to make friends and build relationships. As an adult in therapy, I\u2019ve been unpacking myself and I know that the way I was behaving was regretful and terrible. What I don\u2019t know is how to behave differently. This is how I\u2019ve been living my life since I was at least 11. I\u2019m 24 now.

Any advice is welcome and I\u2019m open to talking in detail about the things I\u2019ve done in PM (I\u2019ve not hurt anyone or done anything that will follow me anywhere but in my own mind so I don\u2019t think it would trigger anyone) if that would help you form an opinion", "title": "How do I become more trustworthy?"}, {"created_utc": 1615829009, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m5pu5c/i_finally_deleted_my_gw_account_where_i_posted_my/", "num_comments": 149, "score": 1, "selftext": "TW: sex, body image, porn\n\nHello everyone! I [22F] started posting last December 2020 on Reddit, so it has been 4 months. I was active on two Gone Wild pages. Before I started posting, I was very depressed. I was verbally abused by my dad who had a history of emotional abuse; I had to rethink so many things from my childhood as I'm really close with him. Also, I felt so terrible about my body. I had been in and out of disordered eating but I've never been \"skinny\". I'm pretty average on clothing size.\n\nI posted nudes and sexually explicit videos of myself. I loved the attention that men gave me. I received thousands of upvotes and thousands of messages in total which included a lot of praises and inappropriate advances. I even got threatened by some men who didn't get what they wanted but I didn't mind as I perceived it as a compliment. I felt like I had some sense of control and power. I was a virgin and had been too focused on school that I felt like I needed a way to engage in something fun where I could sexually express myself. And I felt the high when my body got validated by men around the world.\n\nBut along with this, came way, way, more consequences. I thought about sex too many times in a day - during class, meals with family, doing the groceries, praying, etc. I felt mind fog almost all day. I couldn't focus on college, my family, or myself, which are supposed to be the most important things for me right now. I automatically looked at people as sexual objects. Whenever I saw a man or a woman, I imagined them naked or in sexual positions.I got sucked into the porn world that's aimed to satisfy the male gaze. There were things that used to be clearly wrong to me and I even fought against (rape, racist remarks, infidelity, etc.), which eventually sounded right the last few months which I even unconsciously enabled, and I am so ashamed of that.\n\nI compared myself to other girls who posted nudes. I was one of the only posters who didn't have OnlyFans or other means of selling, so I didn't have as much engagements as them, which increased my self-loathing and insecurity. It frustratingly took many takes before I could decide on one photo/video I like which took angles and posing, etc. and I felt bad about the ones I didn't like. I airbrushed around 3 posts, and wanted so badly to look like the airbrushed version.\n\nWhat prompted me to delete my account and eventually stop happened two nights ago, where I posted a sexually explicit video that blew up. Since this video became popular and got me so much attention, I shared several other posts within an hour and all of them got the highest number of engagements I ever had and were on the \"hot\" page. Because of this, I wasn't able to study for my quiz, and lightbulb moment: I still felt terrible about my body and myself. So it didn't matter how many men validated me. \n\nToday is my first day after I deleted the account and I feel so lost - like a big part of me which I have been depending on for my worth and pleasure for months is now gone, and I need to find healthy coping mechanisms now. I know I'm doing the right thing for my mental health and to leave the void I was in. I can finally work on personal development and want sustainable joy instead. If you have any advice on how I can move on from this and get back on my feet, I would appreciate it very much.\n\nNote: I respect the decisions of sex workers and sexual content creators. I am sharing my own personal experience and I'm aware there may be women in the world who are in a similar position as me.\n\nTL:DR: I finally deleted my Reddit account where I posted my nudes and other sexual content for 4 months because it has ruined me and my life in many ways.

They think, \"I am this, that, and the other,\" and create a list of labels that they identify with. This is normal and how the psyche operates.\n\nThe list is constructed of 'things' that they experience in the real world that have a **lasting effect on them.** They may be a soccer player. They may be a doctor. They may like classical music. All these 'things' become attachments and help construct their character. The sum total of all these attachments should be determined by how well that person can interact with the world and be successful. Of course, everyone's version of success is different and is influence by their awareness and education of what success means in a particular environment. Add in some innate temperaments, and you have a personality.\n\nThis form of self-creation is mostly done unconsciously and evolves over a lifetime. Eventually, the person reaches a point where they are successful enough for their requirements and decide to stop chasing new experiences through hard work. Having new experiences takes work and can be stressful and anxiety-producing. So, to avoid the uncertain, people get comfortable and nest into their character.\n\nThis can prove to be a problem, though.\n\nNot all parts of our character are good, and some may inhibit our quality of life.\n\nWe may have had a negative experience that left scars. We may have attached ourselves to vices, desires, and addictions. We may have become rude, arrogant, and unpleasant in our temperament. We may have developed habits that ruin our life, such as spending more money than we make. We may be fearful and lazy.\n\nAll these factors can be part of our character, whether we like to admit it or not.\n\n**From this point, we have two options.**\n\n**Make a conscious change.**\n\n**Not make a conscious change and face a breakdown later on.**\n\n**Either way, you will have to change whether you like it or not.**\n\nEventually, the vices will consume or kill you. Eventually, your spending habits will leave you broke. Eventually, you will have no friendships because of your abrasiveness. By not changing a dysfunctional quality, you invite chaos into your life.\n\nFor the sake of it, let's just say that you consciously decide to change.\n\n**You must kill a part of yourself.**\n\nThe dysfunctional part that you attached to, and was a part of your character for so long, has to go.\n\nYou need to remove it from your list of 'things' that make you 'you.'\n\nIn doing this, an imbalance happens, and your ordered list becomes chaotic during the change period.\n\nYou no longer do what you used to, and that is new uncertain territory.\n\nYou don't know how you will respond and how you will act.\n\nYou don't know how others will perceive you and whether you will receive backlash.\n\nBut, this is part of the process and a necessary step.\n\nFrom the depths of your chaos, a new improved you will arise. You will be stronger after facing your chaotic storm and making a tough decision. You will look at who you once were and not recognize yourself. You will be closer to your authentic self and have developed the skills to recreate yourself again and again until you are proud of who you have become.\n\nYou have just gotten rid of something that was weighing you down, hurting your life.\n\nNow, you have the space to adopt something positive to take its place as you rebalance yourself.

I can barely bring myself to take off my \"house shorts\" and throw on a pair of sweats before heading out, and even then, I feel like it is a pointless task, as I never bump into anyone and the random people that do see me don't care about me or what I look like.

My newest medication has actually helped a bit but nothing major. And after seeing multiple therapists there has only been slight improvement to anything. It feels like there's no way to make things better or move forward - even though I know there is my mental state cloaks my entire future in a fog.\n\nCurrently I just moved back home to live with family until I can get a job and place of my own, although I'm not sure that's what I really want because it changes every day. There is no dream or overarching goal that I have. Everything slips through my fingers. Looking forward doesn't seem all that interesting to me. I'm only qualified for minimum wage jobs because I haven't been able to handle getting a degree. I'm so sick of working in restaurants and retail, but I don't have skills or a degree so I'm stuck. And with my mental health always causing trouble, taking any chances on things becomes that much harder for me. So I feel trapped, frustrated, and overwhelmed by my current state of affairs (and that's not including the current events going on in the world).\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't know who I want to be. I've read self help books. I've watched TedTalks. I've meditated, journaled, ranted online, tried getting out of my comfort zone. All of it leads back to a general sense of helplessness and confusion. And nobody seems to understand any of this. They offer some cliche or advice that worked for them but doesn't really apply to my situation. I know I'm not entirely unique, we're all struggling with something. We all have our own story, each filled with our own experiences with joy and sorrow, contentedness and frustration. Life isn't easy for any of us. But for me, I wish it was just a little bit easier. It's like there was an important meeting I missed at some point that most people went to - some ingrained acceptance of reality that escapes me. How am I supposed to know what I want? Or what's right or wrong or best for me or anyone else?\n\nI mean it\u2019s remarkable really, the sheer amount of different lives that can be lived. There\u2019s teachers, poets, police officers, lobbyists, truck drivers, clowns, writers, readers, singers, and listeners. There\u2019s Christians, Muslims, Jews, Mormons, Buddhists, Taoists,  and atheists. There\u2019s lovers and fighters, jokers and smokers, uptight assholes and carefree dudes, risk-takers and risk-averserers. You can live on the beach and work at the surf shop or you can live in a studio downtown and work your ass off. You can be a church-goer who coaches his kids little league team or you can abandon religion altogether and try to be the cool uncle. You can please everyone else or even not think of others in the slightest. These are all choices we can make. And like Sylvia Plath mentioned in The Bell Jar, of the figs on the tree, if we don\u2019t decide for ourselves what direction to go, the figs will start to rot away and we never get to have any of them. So here I am standing in front of the fig tree, wishing to have them all because as far as I know this is the only opportunity at life I get. This is my one chance to make something of the brief flash of consciousness between two eternities of darkness. Yet, I\u2019m struck by fear of the unknown, by doubts, by insecurity, by a complete lack of self-reliance, because this understanding is liberating, but terrifyingly so.\n\nI hope this doesn't come across melodramatic. I'm just tired of it all and my future prospects don't seem all that bright. I'm mid-20s though, young by most standards, so there is of course hope.

When its time to do important stuff our mind gives negitive emotion of that work emotions like bordom, fear Etc and then gives us instant positive emotion to fillfill it like , porn, netflix etc . ex: if its time for study your brain will give negitive emotions like omg its boring then reward you with positive one like okey i will just watch porn for 15 min so understand this and use chunking method to do imp work cuz if you will follow your brain means follow the positive emotion you will will end up procrastinating the more you listen to it if will be more hard for you to do your work . \n\n2.

I'd really appreciate some insight if yall are able :). \n\nTL;DR: Newly single and looking for a way to prepare myself for my upcoming life changes (moving out, graduate school, self care etc.)\n\nBack in March, I broke up my serious relationship. It was 2-3 years so not too long but considering it was the first relationship that was really serious I was surprised I didn't feel worse about it. I felt guilty but yeah I also felt that it was better to break it up since I felt that I was settling. My partner is not inherently bad but I felt something.. was off really. Maybe it was a mistake but since the thought of breaking up was on my mind for awhile, it was better than just being a relationship for the sake of being in one.\n\nSo now I am single! I don't really plan to date or well I thought about it but I don't really feel like seeking out someone. I told someone, who is literally a workaholic (similar to me but everything is winding down) that I had feelings for them but I don't want to push it anywhere. I'm not eager to control the situation and personally, I feel pretty secure with where I am confidence wise so whatever happens I expect being upset LOL but I know I have a lot going for me. Overall, it's all uncertain but I wanted to ask what to make of this whole situation.\n\nI'll be moving to a pretty diverse city and starting graduate school. I wanna practice a lot more self-care. I'm planning to join the university climbing team (since I used to climb but stopped since my mother is very controlling and would question me about it so I had to stop). Furthermore, I want to really get into reading more, journaling, and even filmmaking/photography. However, I do have a bit of anxiety just putting myself out there and I really want to overcome it. \n\nOverall, I just want to be the person I've really always wanted to be. My family has stifled me for a LONG time and anything really to just get out of this static mindset of staying at home all the time.

So, I'm on disability which combined with mom's income helps give my niece a good life(mom has custody). I've had an internet addiction for probably 15 years, and a drinking habit for 8 years, and I'm 6 months off nicotine.\n\nOn to the story. 2020 hit me hard and I've been struggling with a lot of stuff but all that wound up in me not losing weight last summer like I did in the summer before it. Instead, I not only gained, I shot past my original start weight of 235lbs and up to 245lbs, which makes me class 2 obese according to the BMI scale. That terrified me, and got me thinking about changes I need to make. Real ones. Major ones. Lifestyle ones.\n\nTo start, it's only for 35 days. That lines up to over a month and a little bit after I get a medication refill. A good trial period. I will also take a look back at it all and see if I want to continue these hardcore changes.\n\nI've already been off reddit for the better part of the last month and a half, but I am vastly restricting my time on discord. Weekends only, and no notifications, so I have to intentionally check it. I had responsibilities on one of my discord communities, but I'll explain to them that I have to take some time off. Those two social medias were all I had left, but I spent all my time chatting on one or the other.\n\nI'm reserving my computer to work on my hobbies, write on my blog, to play games on.

I think the medicine did wonders and I just haven't tried a forced sobriety streak. \n\nI'm not sure anyone here has any experience with avolition, but I have it bad for a lot of stuff, even basic hygiene stuff. So,I set up a daily routine in my Daylio app, and my getting ready routine is to weight myself, take my meds, brush my teeth and put on deoderant. Then an evening routine for meds, brush teeth, floss, and journal. Since I set that up, I've completed it both times today and yesterday. I only normally manage to just take my meds each morning and night.\n\nI swapped my uber eats pass for a pass to the loseit app, and I'm back on logging all my calories. I'm also not eating till noon and stopping eating at 8pm. The calorie tracking is to make sure I eat enough in my window to last me till the next day.\n\nFinally, walking has done wonders for my weight loss journey before, so I found this new game called Fitness RPG, and it converts steps taken into a currency in the game. That game also has a daily list of things to do that are just good for you and you get more fit currency from it. I also use my fitbit app for more detailed tracking of heart minutes, step goals, and sleep tracking. Then I found a third dopamine hit for getting my walking in, which is the rings on the google fit app.\n\nI know the weight I hit was cause of a large meal on thursday, and it's already been passed through my system cause I clocked in just under obese class 2 this morning with 3lbs lost.

My friends started using it in 2016 and had links to their profiles on their instagram bios so I thought, hey, why not give it a try.\n\nThe first time I used it was when I was in middle school when I wanted so hard to be like everyone else without evne giving a shit about my own problems. I would just scroll through the app looking at all these perfectly curated photos of people's lives and everyone's parties while I was lonely and barely had any actual friends. Not to mention I only posted shitty memes just for attention whilst having nothing actually interesting to contribute. This only made me feel worse.\n\nFast forward to 2019/2020 when the \"vsco girls sksksk and I oop\" became a thing and I re-downloaded the app. \n\nThen I had a crush on a girl who just happened to have an account. I clicked the link in her instagram bio and followed her on the app. Don't even get me started on the crush on her. It was ..... bad. Completely atrocious. I was wasting all my mental energy on her, becoming upset and angry constantly because she didn't like me back, and then mistook basic human decency for romantic interest. All this while I was looking at her perfectly curated photos on the app (and her friends' perfectly curated photos) and thus started feeling like a failure. The final straw was when she blocked me on Snapchat after I sent a selfie to her on Snapchat. Two days later when she posted a pic of herself on Vsco of herself in a swimsuit by the pool I was done. Just done. She just on my feelings and didn't give a shit about me, I thought. I just said \"Fuck this shit, I'm out\" and rage-deleted the app.\n\nBut I didn't delete the account yet...\n\nI never saw her and her friends in-person ever again due to covid. At that point I was in college and already starting to make new friends. Meanwhile the whole crush I had on her was starting to bother me. So I knew I had to cut her off. And her friends too because they were now irrelevant in my life at that point. I blocked and unfriended them on all my social media profiles to ensure that none of them would ever reach out to me again.\n\nExcept the vsco account! Shit, the vsco account, I thought! I forgot!\n\nSo I was wondering what to do with it. At that point it was just sitting in a pile of dust. It was completely useless and it didn't contribute much positive things to my life. Meanwhile I was being bombarded with perfectly curated photos of people and parties that have made me feel worse. I had no reason to continue using it any longer and I could go without it.\n\nSo, I did it. During my break at work today, I logged into my account, saved whatever pictures I had posted, then deleted it without saying a word. Then I immediately returned to work from break.\n\nNot many people may care but at least it's a start for me.

I'm no stranger to the classic cycle of one day trying to \"fix\" my life for a few months, and then slowly falling into old patterns until I feel awful enough I start that cycle again. Like many others, this last year and some of this year has resulted in a rapid decline of my mental health and has been digging up a lot of issues that I haven't had the capacity to handle, and now I feel like I'm at this drowning point that I desperately want to get out of.\n\nTrying to keep my story short, the majority of my mental health issues are heavily rooted in my horrible family relationships. I grew up with (what im now learning the terminology of with research) a codependent and emotionally abusive mother who runs the family, and an otherwise great and positive but overbearing father who doesn't really understand boundaries or gives me space, as well as their own horrible relationship with each other, that I have always been the therapist for. Things are somewhat better with my family, but I'm still out here suffering with anxiety and depression, as well as some intimacy issues and low self worth. It sucks. Anyway, during 2020 I had moved back home and felt myself going backwards and feeling like a teenager again, which was mental health hit #1. It was difficult for all of us and so eventually my family agreed to let me live in our old house (my childhood home)that they were remodeling to sell until the pandemic let up and I could get on my feet. I've honestly been downspiraling ever since because I feel like a failure, and I think that living here is sort of a trigger to all the things I dealt with growing up, and brings up this feeling of never having escaped and ending up where I started. I haven't been able to cope with these feelings very well.\n\nIn the last 6 months or so have fallen into this insane depression that I've never felt before. I don't do any of the things I love anymore, or anything at all for that matter. I am unemployed, unmotivated, gaining weight (am currently the highest i've ever been), and in a confusing and failing relationship. I feel numb, like I have no personality, and have no reason to get up in the morning. I feel like my bad mental health is part of why my relationship has fallen into a weird place too.\n\nEven with everything I have been recently trying to do things that I know will improve my situation and bad feelings. I am applying to jobs in a city a few hours away, I am (sort of) getting up to do workouts more often, trying to put my energy into hobbies I used to like, or new ones, and have been keeping my space relatively clean. It honestly feels like it hasn't helped at all though. Maybe it's because I haven't done enough to see results? Maybe because I feel like I'm clowning myself after so many times I've tried to improve and failed? I'm not sure. I honestly still feel like nothing is right, and I just feel like a scared little kid. I think I definitely would benefit from therapy but I don't know anything about that process, nor do I have insurance or a job yet, so I can't afford simple checkups without my family getting involved.\n\nI want to improve, feel independent and more secure of myself, but since I've definitely been staying in these depression dips in the meantime while I reach those milestones. My main goals right now are getting that new job that helps me move out of the house, rekindling hobbies, and losing some weight as a form of self care and generally feeling healthier/better about myself. Does anyone have any advice to offer, or generally some motivational words that can help keep me going? I feel a bit helpless and tend to struggle with self motivation and discipline in general.

I'm 29 years old, to be 30 in 3 months. For the past 8 years since I graduated college, I have pretty much wasted that time. I first got into self-help/self-improvement when I was 22 or 23 and I started reading books to help me optimize my life. At this point, I've probably read about 300+ or so books on various topics all helping me optimize my productivity and progress. Unfortunately, that hasn't really helped me.\n\nMy 20s have been marked by extreme financial difficulty, I stayed in a job where I was getting underpaid for about 2 years, making around 40k/year. At that time, I was intending to save up money to move out of my mom's house and I thought I would be able to do it when I was 25, in 2017. Unfortunately, I ended up getting laid off and tried to go full-tilt with a company I started part time. That venture unfortunately failed and left me in severe debt. I was in dire financial straits all of 2018. I then got hired at a place beginning of 2019, making 55k/year. \n\nI planned on moving out that year but again, I had so much debt so I intended to pay it down and move out in 2020. 2020 came and so did COVID. My mom got furloughed and I stepped up to help with the mortgage on the house. In June of that year, I got laid off (again). I spent a few months learning some skills to make me dangerous at my next job. I then just got hired in April, making 65k/year. I'm optimistic that this place will help me get on a firm financial foundation - but my 20s are over. \n\nThroughout all this time, I virtually didn't do much of what the 20s are about. I never dated/fell in love (partially because I lived at home), I never lived in a different city, I never really traveled, I spent most of it in deep financial scarcity, which lead to lifestyle scarcity. I also had crippling social anxiety and self-doubt which made everything worse. In contrast, I see most of my friends are married or engaged, they have homes, and they had 20something experiences. Sure, I might be debt free in like 5 years or so if I really buckle down but I feel so far behind my friends. \n\nSo I have all this stuff I need to do (date, move out, travel, learn skills, etc.) and limited time to do it in. \n\nI want to be better than this but I don't know where I start.

What triggered it was a comment from a \"friend\" who said that I always seemed to make a fool of myself at parties -- I drank too much, I laughed too loud, I made cringey jokes. I made other people uncomfortable. I spiraled -- I started thinking of ALL the times I acted cringey. Shame became overwhelming. I literally didn't know what to do with it. I broke out in severe eczema, everywhere. My lymph suddenly grew a cyst. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't find the courage to talk about my feelings with anyone -- I felt utterly inappropriate, worthless, cringey. Every time I hung out with friends, I felt like I was trying to atone for myself by being extra nice, extra sweet, extra demure.\n\nDuring quarantine, I read up on self-forgiveness, moving on from toxic shame, all that stuff. I told myself, \"I'm no longer that person.\" I started meditating in earnest, and it really did wonders -- I felt like I had better control over my emotions. But I felt I couldn't completely uproot all the cringe attacks. There was still a part of me that felt ashamed for my past behavior. And there was also a part of me that felt shame for feeling shame -- why did I self-flagellate myself? There must be something wrong with me to think there's something wrong with me. \n\nThen, I realized something, suddenly. There *wasn't* anything WRONG with ME. There was nothing to forgive, nothing to ask forgiveness for.\n\nWhat is shame? From the way I understand it, it's a negative feeling you get when you go against some group's set of rules -- unspoken or otherwise. These rules are subjective -- they differ from group to group, and change with the times and the fashion. (I'd be banished from Ms. Jones's respectable dinner table if I were to walk around my neighborhood without my shirt on, but in other cultures it's perfectly fine for women to bare their breasts.) So, I thought to myself, going against such rules isn't INHERENTLY bad, just \"bad\" within a certain group. I then realized, whenever I feel shame, it was me saying, \u201cI have gone against Group X\u2019s code of accepted behavior.\u201d NOT \u201cI have behaved incorrectly,\u201d or \u201cI am incorrect/inappropriate.\u201d Because it's not anything factual.\n\nI never hurt anyone in these cringey memories I punished myself for, physically or emotionally. Maybe I did laugh too loud, maybe I had some chocolate smeared on my cheek while I was pigging out at the chocolate fondue. But these behaviors aren't inherently bad, or wrong, or embarrassing. Maybe there's a group out there that would think I'm super cool, who knows. \n\nShame is really more about some code of conduct I should follow rather than about my inherent worth. It's a kind of group mentality. And if someone else disapproves of me, it's because they're adhering to the group and its rules whether by choice or (more often) by unconsciously growing up into it -- not because they're better than me, or they know better.  \n\nNow that I know this, I feel that the feeling of shame can be very empowering and enlightening. When I feel shame, that\u2019s a great feedback tool \u2013 it\u2019s letting me know that I am giving too much value to other people, and that I am relying on them for feeling good.  \n\nI feel much more free and conscious of my behavior. I choose certain behaviors because they align with who I am, rather than because they're \"appropriate\" or \"good\" or \"right\" as ordained by some other group of people. So, there's no need to feel shame about past behaviors that I no longer identify with. \n\nI'm sharing my story just in case it can help even just one person who's struggling with what shame. I'd also absolutely love to hear your stories on how you overcame shame.  It is such a difficult emotion when it feels like you can't do anything about it, and you're stuck in your own badness and worthlessness. If you're going through it and suffering, I hope you know that you are so strong, and so good.  There is no one quite like you in this world, so of course you won't be a perfect replica of some group's or society's ideal.

I graduated with an engineering degree, worked as an engineer and absolutely hated my jobs, then I decided I wanted to go to medical school, but after years of trying to get a good score on the MCAT (med school entrance exam) I couldn\u2019t, then COVID happened, couldn\u2019t find a job for months on end, became a math teacher and I am absolutely enjoying every single minute of it tbh.\n\nHere is the thing though, I will most likely never have a \u201chigh\u201d salary as a teacher compared with engineers do, but I am truly happy with being a teacher. I enjoy going to work every single day and this is the first time I felt this way about any jobs. Teaching doesn\u2019t even feel like working for me. Is this happiness worth the salary cut in the long run?\n\nI guess I always have been the jealous type even growing up. I got jealous when my friends got the new Xbox 360 and I didn\u2019t, I got jealous when my friends have better Yu-Gi-Oh cards than me, etc etc. The weird thing is that now I\u2019m not a big spender nor do I want luxury items, but I still can\u2019t help but jealous of friends who make more money than me. If I got a 30k salary bump right now, that extra 30k would go into an investment account anyways, I wouldn\u2019t buy a new car, I wouldn\u2019t buy a fancy TV, I wouldn\u2019t go out an buy a boat. I live pretty frugal and I like it.\n\nI guess my feelings of jealousy stems from my own insecurities.

Anyways there was this one explosive &amp; reckless mf who was always the loudest and he was itching to fight even with his homies about a joint they were smoking there, and there are many more details about the negativity surrounding this dumbass, but that's irrelevant now. So a week or 2 pass by, and we were drinking alcohol around their hood, and I was about to pick up weed from a local dealer around the corner, out of sight to my homies. I got in the car, got weed, got out the car, when this punk approached me and started questioning me aggressively as to why I was in his hood and who I was with, eventually demanding that I give him weed I just bought. 2 of his homies pulled up from the dark, one with a big-ass knife &amp; one with gardening scissors almost the size of a whole arm, and what was even worse I had an injury of one of my vertebraes (it's all good now), and there was no space for me risking an altercation at this moment. So I said \"okay man, here's the weed and I'm going to tell my homies that were going out of here, just don't bother us now\", for some odd reason he wanted to see my homies and said \"nah, we're smoking this together\", I was confused a bit at this point. We got to my homies, and he said something like \"YALL CAN'T BE IN OUR HOOD, WHO ARE YOU MFS, GTFO OF HERE!\" bla bla bla, even his homies were like, \"...okay??\" (Ofc we didn't smoke together), and so we got our stuff and left. Soon a bunch of my friends heard the story and had thought about doing something about it, but eventually nothing happenned. Fast forward a month or 2, it was 12:30 AM and I was walking back home from the city on a street close to their hood, but that was one of the major streets of the whole city, I wasn't expecting him &amp; one of his homies at the end of the street, on a bench (mind you, it's nighttime, past 12 AM, nobody in sight, few cars heading home). I walked close to them, not recognizing him, almost crossing the zebra, when I hear \"Ayo, you got some paper?? I know you mf, you do drugs! You got something on you?\" his friend laughing by his side, I was like \"no, i got nothing\" (I only had 5\u20ac). He was starting to be hostile / aggressive in a second, when his firend said \"Ay, search him\". As soon as he started getting off the bench, I touched my pockets (making sure they were closed) and started bolting away. They immediately jumped, run to catch me and screamed \"AYY, WE'RE ABOUT TO FUCK YOU UP, YOU BETTER STOP!\". After about 10sec, I heard nothing, they were slower than me. Tmrrw, me and my boys, got to their hood, looking for them. We eventually found them, approached, and one of my friends said \"Why do you have a pick on this guy?!\". The mf was sooo scared when he recognized me, almost stared to wimp, and he started to lie how he was only trying to separate me and his friend from a fight... Bruh like whatt? My friend said let's fight now, until one of his guys pulled out them big-ass scissors from under the tree and started screaming how he was finna fuck us up. We had no fckin scissors tf? We wanted to fight, not get ourselves stabbed and make serious injuries. So we backed up, and apparently one of our friends said how he saw 7 more guys approach from distance, possibly affiliated with them, and probably having knives or more. Now my situation is, I don't drink anymore (I drank too much, so I had to stop) &amp; I don't smoke weed anymore (got boring to me), but the problem is my school is near their hood and I have to go there (but I'm near the end of finishing it) and try and avoid any of them if they are possibly there, but personally what bothers me more is the fact that mfs like that exist, I mean they have nothing to lose, pulling out knives and sh!t, soon they'll probably start getting guns. And what I wanted out of this post was an advice on how to stop overthinking about these malignant mfs that exist 3/4 mins away from me.

It's got me questioning about my self-worth, my purpose, the direction of my future, whether marketing is the right path for me, beliefs in relationships and whether I could ever be in one again. \n\nThe hardest part day to day is that constant feeling of anxiety and uncertainty. \n\nAny advice on how I could deal with these feelings?", "title": "Feeling anxious about my future."}, {"created_utc": 1629453362, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8242z/you_should_be_very_aware_of_what_smartphonesvideo/", "num_comments": 52, "score": 97, "selftext": "This post is all about self realization as well as some advice for others out there that it might benefit in the long run so bring a pack of popcorn, some cola and enjoy the ride.\n\n**Prior** **trigger warrning fo sensitive people:** I struggle with grammar a lot so it might get hard for some of you out there. I hope you don't mind as I have put a lot of effort into writing this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that in the recent years Video Gaming industry is going fully into \"Fuck you, we want more money or the highway\" mode and I don't like it. I'm actually thinking of fully dumping gaming which can prove difficult and switch to something more casual that is more creative and doesn't require much of sinking hours upon hours into it.\n\nI think Anime/Movies combined with Cosplaying that includes socializing would be a good option here as it provides a great mixture of craftship, imagination and requires contact with other people to have fun. I have always wanted to try Cosplaying but never did due to the reasons you will find in this post.\n\nI have been playing video games since I was kid (NES/PS1/Early PC's/Windows Millenium/XP era etc). I'm the type of a gamer who just wants to follow a straight forward story with good cinematics and graphics.\n\nNo time wasters like too much grinding where you need to gather resources with thousands of the same side quests to push forward storyline, microtransactions, \"not owning\" for what you pay for, filling games with boring and mundane content that is multiplied thousands times with empty world rather than small world with decent content and interesting story, many overpriced games that are garbage and many more things that more and more are pushing me away from gaming. Also, fuck those subscription based models like in WOW where it's barely worth to pay for it.\n\nIt's actually one of the many reasons why I love PlayStation exclusives, straight storyline, good graphics and cinematics. Such examples could be Uncharted 4, The Last of US or Detroit: Become Human.\n\nHowever, very recently I have found that it's very hard to get excited to play any \"new\" games from the last few years because they are not as exciting as well as they tend to be more and more boring the newer the video game is, there are very few exceptions but nearly all the current age video games lack so called \"innovation\" or straight tries to milk their fan base to their very bones till they become a pure air.\n\nThe latest video game I have fully enjoyed was Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus. Since then I have tried 3 games I thought that I would enjoy in the past few days and the results were:\n\n* **Prey** \\- somehow OK game but a bit too hard even after lowering to the lowest difficulty. However, the more and longer I played this game, the more and more it got me frustrated due to the very high difficulty and overpowered enemies so I just dropped the game.\n* **The Evil Within** \\- The graphics don't bother me that much as the black lines at the top and bottom of the screen. Also, being stuck at the very beginning of the game for hours didn't do it any favours, literally the first level where you control the character can't be easily progressed so I just dropped the game.\n* **Assassin's Creed Valhalla** \\- I think this is the best video game I have enjoyed at least at the beginning of all the 3 that I have tried. This game seemed to be a solid one throughout the beginning where we get the revenge, kill the first boss and pillage their village. When it got to the point of grinding for resources in order to build out our own village, I have completely lost interest in the game and just couldn't play it anymore. I tried to come back to it but after few minutes I got bored. There needs to be some purpose in the main story for me but since I got the revenge which seemed to be the most interesting concept and the main thing for me, it seems that there is nothing left to do, plus the grinding part is really killing it, just like the other Ubisoft games. After the day of gaming, I have once again dropped the game.\n\nI don't think I was burnt out because before trying all of the listed games I have completed Wolfenstein 2 and couldn't stop playing it, it was that good. I think another factor might have been the lack of new releases that I could look forward to. I had some indie games on my radar for a few years that I have never ended up playing but how I see things now, I will definitely drop gaming.\n\nTrying to play all of the 3 games listed above feels like chore and unpleasant experience to me and I feel like more and more modern video games gets caught in such designs that makes them undesirable for me to play them. I just don't know what makes the said video games so hard to play that I just drop them and move on to the next one that would stick like the shit on the wall, never mind wasting my money and time on the way.\n\nWhat I have recently realized when I have compared myself to my peers via LinkedIn is that I'm still stuck at my the job that I'm not happy with and haven't progressed much as more or less when things get difficult, instead of solving them, I instead dive into Video Games or my Smartphone that provides a solid instant gratification hits that makes you happy for a while but with zero rewards in real life. It also acts like a safety net for real life.\n\nI'm nearly 30 years old and have nearly nothing to show for it, still single and socially awkward, no mortgage or house on my name, not married and to add insult to the injury, I have gained some stomach fat during the recent world events but slowly try to get rid of it. So, here I am in a place where I never thought I would be, being nearly 30 years old and wasted my years due to my high smartphone and video games usage.\n\nDuring those times I could easily have gained more and more certificates, experience and be even miles ahead of my younger/the same age peers that I looked up on LinkedIn. I just didn't took any initiative because why should I ? I was better off with just scrolling dumb shit on my smartphone or playing pointless video games that supplied me with so called fake happiness and didn't reward me in real life. It all also made me procrastinate beyong believe.\n\nI'm a very motivated person with great potential to further my career to greater lengths but because I indulged myself in the self pleasure such as smartphone/video games, I have screwed myself up and now have not much to show for it in real life.\n\nI'm glad that looking up my peers on LinkedIn which happened by accident, stressed me out because the more I have been thinking about my life and where I am, I have came to conclusion that I have to put more effort in real life as I'm capable of very great things and just because I'm behind my peers and nearly 30 years old, I still can achieve great things in my life if I lay off things that provide fake happiness and illusion of success in my life.\n\nTherefore, here I am, realizing it all was just a waste of time leaving me behind in my life. Smartphones and Video Games are the new attention and innovation drying technology that more people should be more aware of what type of self harming those evil devices provide in our lives. It's all designed to make someone else's more rich and keep you poor so you would be stuck at the same place because pleasure is within the swipe of the fingertip and hard to reject.\n\nFrom my personal experience, you are only able to see how much such things are time wasters and don't provide any benefit in life when:\n\n* You realize that it's negative for your lifestyle and health\n* Slightly comparing with other people\\\\your peers more or less where you life should be heading to but it doesn't\n* It's too late and you start beating yourself up over it all\n\nI hope this provides some type of valuable information for some of you out there.\n\nHave a nice Friday !", "title": "You should be very aware of what smartphones/video games does to you [Very long read]"}, {"created_utc": 1629452609, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p81wu9/sleepy_and_fatigued_all_the_time/", "num_comments": 8, "score": 2, "selftext": "I feel sleepy and fatigued all the time, how to get rid of it?

I don't do anything but stress about it for two weeks. I try to start counting calories, it won't stick. I've done this before, what's wrong this time? I feel depressed, swim around in my failure for a while, and hate the shit out of my body. I weigh myself. Nothing's changed.\n\nI start looking at other people in the same process and it helps me get a grip. I start logging things in myfitnesspal before I'm allowed to eat them. I buy a craigslist treadmill for cheap and start couchto5k program, zombies run, listening to audiobooks while I'm on it. I don't eat back the exercise calories. Sometimes I screw up but that's what the treadmill deficit is for. If I eat out and can't log something I get as close as I can. I've definitely had two days where I just said \"screw it\" and ate what I wanted. And then I was back on it the next day.\n\nIt turned around for me. I'm down to 161 and it's easier than ever to hit my calorie goals, and I'm setting a new personal best every time I'm running. I put my runs in Smashrun and it feels really nice to see all of it there. \n\nMotivation did not come to me. I think that's maybe a myth, every time I waited for motivation I just had to do it even though I was completely miserable, and my motivation came from doing these things properly and not wanting to undo all the progress and work I put into it. I started weighing my food on a scale, which takes an extra 5 minutes per meal if I'm not eating something packaged, but it went a long way towards helping me not want to binge eat later because I already put in all the time and effort planning carefully.\n\nI think the thing that helped me the most was making these rituals pleasant. I didn't enjoy indoor running, so I gameified it, put on an audiobook, started logging miles and started a program. I did not enjoy logging food so I started playing music while I was doing it to make it less dull. I bought a box of cheez-its and said I'd only eat them if I was under at the end of the day to fill calories and I ATE THE ENTIRE BOX IN ONE SITTING so maybe that one was a mistake but the rest of it helped a bunch.\n\nI've got lots of other stuff to work on, my body's just one aspect.

We've been pretty flirty the whole time, but we never really progressed things. She's been through a lot of trauma and I'm inexperienced when it comes to relationships so we were both scared to some extent about progressing things. We discussed meeting up last year, but covid happened and that put plans on hold.\n\nShe ended up ghosting me basically last summer because she was going through a lot of internal struggles. Questioning her identity, her sexuality. (She came out to be as bi and chopped her hair off) I should point out I stuck around for one reason or another despite everything because I cared about her.  She resurfaced around this time last year and told me she got into a long distance relationship with another girl. That ended up being on again off again till around February of this year. Her partner was emotionally abusive to her and would tell her things like \"you don't care about me\" and the day my friend's dog died her partner told her to get over it and deal with it. They were planning on moving in together, but things fell apart a week before it was going to happen. Her partner was visiting the week before the planned move, but one day things completely fell. I ended up calling my friend like two hours after her partner left and their relationship ended (none the wiser)\n\nDuring the call my friend told me the break up was going to be really difficult for her despite everything that happened. She gave her partner a lot of her heart. Her partner was her first same sex relationship. Also during the call, she told me losing her partner was going to hurt and she'd be able to move on eventually, but if she lost me she wouldn't know how to function anymore.\n\nWe ended up talking a lot more to the point that we were heads over heels for each other in March and April. I was making plans to visit her in August. Then something happened in May, we started drifting. I got jealous because it seemed like she was avoiding me and hanging out with other friends. There was one particular friend that I asked about because it seemed like they hung out a lot. She told me \"he's just a friend don't worry I flirt with a lot of people it means nothing.\" I believed her, but something seemed off so I just filed it away.\n\nOne day I found out at random she planned a trip to Seattle around the same time I was going to visit. So I asked her if  I should extend my vacation and tag along with her, she seemed cool with it then. This was June. From June on I kept trying to finalize plans to visit her and it seemed like she kept avoiding the topic, things seemed to keep coming up (she needed to move places around the same timeframe) She also seemed to be getting closer to the other guy.\n\nJumping ahead to the beginning of this month I asked her if I should just cancel my plans to visit and she said \"idk, im struggling with stuff\" she also told me she had to cancel her Seattle trip and that she hadn't found a place yet. I'd like to think I gave her an out when I asked her that, but she didn't directly say no and it almost seemed like she was avoiding the topic again. I pointed out a few days later that it seemed like she was avoiding the topic of visiting and she told me it was just a bad time to visit, so I kinda just left it at that.\n\nWell a few days later she posted about moving the next day. Then the day after moving she posted about heading off to Seattle. I thought wtf a week or two ago you were telling me you didn't find a place and that you were cancelling your Seattle trip. When I asked about the Seattle trip she told me she was going by herself and not with her friends like originally planned.\n\nEarlier this week while she was there I found out through social media that she didn't go by herself and that she went with the guy I was jealous of (she doesn't know I know she went with him).  Earlier today I asked her about trip because I was hurt that it seemed she lied to me about cancelling the trip, I was willing to make last minute plans to tag along. She told me the trip was last minute and she emphasized how she went alone and that having time to herself was nice.\n\nI know she's lying to me when she says to went alone.

Flash forward to the present and it\u2019s been 2 years since my aunt passed and about a year and a half since my mom passed and I\u2019m at one of the lowest points in my life thus far. I have nightmares of the night my mother passed consisting of graphic memories of the doctors attempting to resuscitate her. They come less often than they used to, but they still disturb me and often times I cannot sleep a healthy amount of time. I\u2019ve tried therapy, but the pandemic made it hard to find good therapists and the sessions I\u2019ve been to have not helped me much. My relationship with my dad has been off ever since I found out that he already started talking to someone 6 months after mom passed. I barely made it through my last semester of school and took summer off to give me a break because I\u2019m having trouble staying motivated and focusing. I\u2019ve lost excitement for most things and I barely recognize myself in the mirror. What was once a clean cut and muscular adult is now some disheveled obese creature. I\u2019m lucky that my girlfriend stayed with me through these times, but I have guilt for her staying because I know she deserves better. My friends keep in touch, but it\u2019s not the same as in person. I\u2019m trying to stop this low point from snowballing by trying to work out again and going outside more, but sometimes I just feel hopeless. I know it\u2019s probably a combination of grief and depression, but I don\u2019t want to keep letting those things control my life.

Am I self-aware?**\n\n&gt;*I was always mediocre in studies. Knowing this, I joined a tough professional course (equivalent to CPA) and couldn't pass the examinations in last 4 years.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Do I avoid responsibilities? Am I hard-working?**\n\n&gt;*I am an idler. I tend to shy away whenever I feel like I am out of my comfort box. Hence, never learned anything in my life. Never volunteered for anything. Never went out on a short trip with friends. In short, never experienced life when I had opportunities coming my way.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I passionate about?

Why don't I seek help from a professional?**\n\n&gt;I am currently undergoing a phase II of depression. The first phased occurred way back in 2017, when I saw a professional. He put me on meds, which didn't allow me to sleep. So without consulting him, I went cold turkey the same year. So, my experience with depression is pretty long-term I guess. The reason why I don't seek help is  \n&gt;  \n&gt;a) I am trapped in my comfort zone, which is not going outside. Staying in, videogaming and binge watching movies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;b) It reminds of the medications, and therefore, the sleepless nights I had in 2017.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to get out of get out of my comfort zone badly, but depression has crippled me so much that my mental state has shifted from \"I will start tomorrow\" to \"tomorrow will never come\".\n\nPlease advice what can I do to turn my life around with all these negative qualities riding on my shoulders.", "title": "I want to be better.

By successful, I refer to a young adult whom is profoundly motivated and became notable in whatever field he was passionate in, doing many amazing projects in the area. He would also be involved in his community and have a strong network of people whom would provide him with connections and friendships. My ideal self would also be resilient, persistent, direct in speaking (like a Dutch person), and satisfied with life. Most importantly, I would be strong in character, that is, a humble, caring, genuine down-to-earth role model that everyone likes (think Keanu Reeves).\n\nFast forward to when I am 18 today, and this dream is further from reality. Nearly a decade of \"self-corruption\" and wrong choices has strayed me far from the version of me I wanted to become. While I still have the ability to turn my life around and change for the better (I have done this before), I no longer see the point in even trying because there is now something holding back that is simply too much:\n\nMy past.\n\nWhen I was 15 and 17, I did some terrible things that I regret. While I forgive myself for what I did, I fear that they may resurface in the future and completely destroy the success I would work hard to build. Now you may be wondering what it was that I did. Unfortunately, I will not go into exact details in order to protect my privacy. However, I will provide hints and analogies to give you an idea of just how bad it was.\n\nI wish I would have been a typical, acting out \"troubled teen\" instead of doing what I did. I wish I would have:\n\n- Joined the wrong crowd and have done/dealt drugs.\n- Done graffiti and severe property damage.\n- Shoplifted and stolen from friends/neighbors.\n- Hijacked cars and broke into vehicles.\n- Beat someone up.\n- Hacked into a secret computer system and caused havoc.\n\nIf I did any of the above, I would he able to move on and reform without looking back. I know this because everyone would see this as a \"troubled past I overcame\" and would not destroy my career if it were to come out. In fact, I would be the one \"outing\" myself for such deeds and use them as anecdotes to inspire others.\n\nWhile what I did hasn't broken any laws at all, it is still very bad. If I were to reform myself and become a truly wholesome human being (like Keanu), and my past were to come out, people would see me more as a \"depraved individual manipulated everyone into believing he's good\" as opposed to a \"former troubled kid\". I would not be able to inspire others by opening up about my misdeeds, because it will be seen as more of an \"admission of guilt\" instead of an anecdote.\n\nWhether my deeds are forgivable or not is something that even I am unsure of. Overall, I wish I was a normal \"troubled teen\", or even one of those \"pariah weird kids\" in highschool instead of the \"nice-on-the-outside-bad-on-the-inside\" person I was as a teen. The former examples don't have the need to hide their past, while I do.

Although this looks passable, I always thought my physique could be improved: there always has been blubber of fats around my belly that I wish I could rid off. For the past 5 years of so, this desire has always stayed with me as I always dropped out of this goal in my previous attempts.\n\nI recently sat down and to reflect in order to see why my previous attempts failed and the explanation boils down to two main aspects:\n\n* How I approach problems\n* How I perceive my progression\n\nFor all of the attempts that I previously made in the past years, they were all about getting to 72 kg in terms of weight (as this would be the best BMI according to my height - I know that BMI can be wrong at times, but this is helpful as a guide to know what should my weight loss goal be).\n\n**Mindset**\n\nSo, I set a goal for myself, great. Now, it is time for me to dwell deep into my mindset and how I approach problems. I'm the type of guy that likes to deal with things promptly in order to avoid postponing them as I fear that I'll forget important details regarding this task. It wasn't surprising that I wanted to see quick results and to complete a task as quickly as possible.\n\n**Problem**\n\nMy mindset of \"quickly dealing\" with tasks might work with tasks related to jobs and university, but it doesn't work so well when I'm trying to lose 16 kg of weight as weight loss is a slow and long-term process.\n\nThis mindset also impacted how I perceived my progression: I would lose 0.3 kg a week and I would think, \"that's so little, why can't I lose more?\"\n\nThen, I'll cut more calories, exercise a lot more, and basically drive myself to get burned out with the prospect of losing weight.\n\nEventually, the mere idea of counting calories and exercising would discourage me as my mindset indicated that despite all of the extra efforts, what I obtained as a reward (losing 0.3 kg weekly) didn't match what I put into this goal (as I thought that I should lose 0.5 kg weekly).\n\nAnd thus, I would abandon my goal of losing weight as I would begin to perceive that my struggle was futile.\n\n**Solution**\n\nFor this attempt, I decided that instead of setting the starting goal to reach 72 kg, I would set the bar extremely low, so low that it would be laughably easy to reach.\n\nI would first begin with the goal to go from 88 kg (my current weight) to 87 kg. Then, once I reached this new weight, to stabilize it for a few days, and then move set a new goal of 86 kg, then 85 kg, and so on, until I reach 72 kg.\n\nI believe that since the goal of losing 1 kg is much more feasible than losing 16 kg. In addition, since it would be easier to reach this goal, I believe the extra motivation of seeing quick results and reaching my objectives should allow me to retain faith in the process and to avoid the spiral that led to the demise of my previous runs.\n\nSo, let's give it a try again :)", "title": "After dropping out of my goal to lose weight multiple times before, I'm back at it now but with a new strategy this time"}, {"created_utc": 1629333565, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p744pg/how_do_i_become_content/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m in my last year of school and I find life so meaningless sometimes.

And while drugs are involved, I\u2019m not talking about smoking weed; I\u2019m just referring to achieving any sort of \u201chigh\u201d in general. I must have an incredibly addictive personality because pretty much all of the ways I prefer to get myself high are destructive to not only myself but the people around me as well. I would rather not share the things I have done, but let\u2019s just say there are territories that even your average person who enjoys getting high one way or another would never venture into. (Some of the things I do aren\u2019t all that bad on their own, but it\u2019s the extent at which I am doing them that is harmful.) In spite of this though, for some reason, venturing down very dark paths of destruction and self-harm, all while not moderating myself nor trying to better myself and grow as a person, is more appealing to me, and when I get any sort of urge or craving, I make no attempt to stop myself or even say, \u201cmaybe I shouldn\u2019t do this\u201d. I am constantly running away from my problems, refusing to face them head-on, and brush off the idea that doing all of it is not only not helping me but in fact weakening me and even bringing down my peers to some degree.\n\nI seem to need instant gratification. I just can\u2019t seem to say \u201cno\u201d to a high despite any regrets I feel or consequences I may suffer afterward. It\u2019s not that I enjoy hurting myself (however I may do so), I just am scared to death of facing my problems, refusing to do things that I would be proud of myself for and that others may find appealing. I\u2019ve lost friends and people who were once close to me because of this. I\u2019m not even trying to push them away; I am just turning myself into this potentially toxic being. I, who once used to be full of positivity, now repel it, and in turn am not someone who anyone in the right mind would want to be around.\n\nIn other words, I have received wake-up calls to get my shit together before, yet I continue giving in to my cravings and not even trying to stop myself. I don\u2019t seem to want to get better. I just seem to want to continue doing these ruinous things, despite the consequences they may have. I\u2019ve gotten help, and I try to interpret and absorb it, but the only person who can better myself is me, and I simply cannot understand why getting high is as more appealing to me as it is than actually growing as a person and doing things that result in nothing but positive outcomes. We all need a break once in a while, but this is overkill. For every negative consequence of which I suffer from getting high, I run away from it by getting high again. Rinse and repeat. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. A destructive loop. I\u2019ve weaved myself into this web and I am having a really hard time getting out of it.\n\nI think the reason it\u2019s so hard to escape might just be that, aside from my addictive personality (which I don\u2019t mean to use as an excuse for my actions), I don\u2019t feel like I have any reason to get better. I could put in the effort, and while I know I will earn much better things, things that are worth much more than what a bunch of highs are giving me, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t actually earn anything from it.\n\nI feel like I have no purpose or reason to get better, but to my knowledge, it does not work that way; something you should earn doesn\u2019t just show up first so you can say: \u201cah yes, NOW I will try to improve myself\u201d, no. You have to take the initiative for things that you can earn to even show up at all. But why must I keep wanting? I already do have things in my life not just worth earning, but that I have already earned in the past and are worth keeping; it is not worth losing the things and people I love just to get some instant gratification, nor it is it worth losing who I am as a person. I have to remember who I really am, and find it within myself to take the initiative to get better.

In my 20s I was just released into the world having to fend for myself with no track record that I could do it. The optimistic assumptions I made at 16 are not as simple as you once thought. An end to a relationship or a job or an argument with someone appeared to be the end of the world... I did not trust myself and did not trust the world. This time came with many anxieties, pains and concerns... Sometimes paralizing.\n\nBeing many years older and having lived it, let me assure you, it was not the end of the world. Part of the lessons to learn during this time is that when you have a roof over your head and you have some healthy food for the day, you have all you need to thrive.\n\nThe most important relationship to work on during your youth is your relationship with yourself. Learn to do things to be proud of yourself. Create little routines that help you thrive. Start by making your bed in the morning. I do it every day when I wake up even now. When I look at that thing and am proud, that is win number 1!!!  \n\nNext routine: Forgive myself! I forgive myself for all the mistakes I made in my entire life and the day before, for being a bit lazy, for not knowing any better, not exercising as hard as I should have or could have, etc. Once I forgive myself, I forgive myself again. There is so much wrong making in ALL of us automatically: ourselves, our parents, friends, significant other, God, the universe, politicians, etc...  All of that chokes out life. All of that is avoiding dealing with what there is to deal with and our minds make it so much more complicated than it is. Forgiveness is the access to live in a much less smelly quarters.\n\nNext, exercise and healthy food. You need some exercise so your body tells your stomach to turn food into energy rather than store it as fat.  Then eat healthy food.  Food is fuel, nothing else. If you dream of being a lean, mean racehorse, food is only fuel.  It is not a means to cope, a little reward, a way to get over a relationship. The sooner you learn that the easier it is to cultivate healthy habits. The way to a healthy body and mind is 80% food / 20% exercise so pay 4 times more attention to what you eat rather than your exercise routine. It does not just impact your body but also your brain!!!\n\nNext: Get connected with your values, your commitments and you passions.  Write them down. Change them until you are proud of them and one with them. That is who you are... Don't write down things, write down ways of being such as: I am proud, respectful, tenacious, loving...  Whatever you connect with. That is what you are sculpting yourself into. And when you notice where you are not aligned with your body and automatic mind, try to act from your values and commitments rather than the impulse. This is a day to day battle: you against you and you will not always win. In the beginning you will loose out a lot. When you loose, go back to step number 2.\n\nFeelings and emotions: You have them and they are a hot mess. They are all over the place and I am not even including hormones. Learn to get over them when needed. OBSERVE them rather than BE them. Get connected to your values, your commitments, your passions and observe whether or not they are aligned.  A lot of times they are not. Learn that you are not your feelings. You have them and they do not have to run the show.\n\nA friend once gave me this beautiful saying: \"A caterpillar, when it turns into a cocoon, before it re-emerges into the world as a butterfly, must think that it is dying.\" This is what you are going through a lot in this phase of your life. You are working yourself out, you are learning lessons, you are getting connected to yourself, you are discovering your own power, etc, etc, etc...  And you are about to be reborn as a butterfly each time when you learn the lessons.  Your mission is to learn and you will learn. Life will poke you in the ribs until you do...\n\nI may have confused and even offended a few people off here. If so, I apologize. Only take what empowers you and serves you. I Love you all. And I so get what really a tough time of your life this can be during this cocoon phase.\n\n(And by the way, I still get those even in my 60s, but I learned to welcome them)", "title": "My 20s were challenging also.

Because I have low self confidence, I was always quick to give up on everything I've ever tried - I worked just as hard if not harder than others and they would succeed and I wouldn't. One time I was super close with the recruiter from my dream internship- she told me everything I needed to know to ace the interview, (and I prepared with career services, independent research, etc.) and when I got to the interview it was nothing like anyone told me, and I bombed it. Yes I got a bad interviewer, but when that ticket to the rest of my life (it was a summer internship + full time offer) was gone, I crumbled, and between feeling my life was over and having an autoimmune flareup, I withdrew or failed from 5 semesters of college in a row. I got back into school and have dedicated 110% of my time to getting A's - it paid off, through 47 credits I have earned all straight A's (besides a B+ in a mini course and one professor made a mistake and gave me a B but because I got sick and was hospitalized I couldn't pursue the grade change). This summer I'm taking 4 courses (2 400 level courses completed with A's, and I just started the other 2) while working a full time internship. I'm living at home to save money but I also have a bit of an abusive situation at home where my father threatens to cut me off from health insurance, car, money, food, etc. if I don't do everything he wants (i.e. working for him, despite me already being so busy) and my mother screams at me if I dare to leave the house - she's not happy unless I'm home and we go through so much fighting if I try to go out that either I don't go or if I do manage to go I have a bad time as I'm so emotionally drained. I also had a negative reaction to the Covid vaccine - tinnitus and partial vision loss in one eye - so that has been driving me insane and I'm devastated. Could my life get worse? Of course, it could always be worse. But I'd say its pretty bad considering I have horrible heath, no social life, crippling anxiety, and work 15 hours a day.*\n\n*Given I've worked hard in the past of course I've pondered if I hadn't given up if I would have eventually succeeded, so that's why despite things being SO bad right now I'm not giving up and just working through it. But it feels as if fate has it that I'll never succeed no matter what I do, and I just feel so down. So I'm seeking success stories of people who have had the world against them, persevered and eventually achieved the success that made it all worth it. Or just general advice on how to get strong enough where 1. I don't consider giving up and 2. that I actually succeed. I'm a result driven person, so holding onto baseless hope isn't enough. So any tips on how to get results (and not get discouraged meanwhile) is greatly appreciated.

She(22F) asked me out(24M) and went out  on a few dates. I could tell she fancied me. I was feeling a bit lonely  at the time and just wanted to experience something new so I stuck with  it. She was being fairly affectionate although a bit too attached in her  behavior. My concerns started about six months in when she said she was  almost 'harrassed' while drunk at a party but did not have sex. She  dropped the L bomb at that point too. I did not know how to feel about  that but I believed her and decided to work through it. Over the next  few months she moved for work and I was trying to figure out my life. We  argued a lot. She had big family issues, hated both her parents and had  a string of bad and abusive relationships. I started noticing at that  point how much she enjoyed drinking and substances(way too much for my  taste) and got bored way too easily and that was kind of putting me off.   She also wanted loads of attention, gratification and displays of love  on social media. We would disagree a lot on our tastes and I felt like I  couldnt get her 'talking' if that makes sense. Not unless there were  drugs or sketchy people involved in the narrative. I also could not make  out much of her relationship or sexual past.\n\nAs  I was figuring out my shit I started to feel behind in life with work  and my relationship with her was deteriorating. We somehow made it  through that bit. We would support each other every now and then. We  gave each other decent birthdays. She booked us a flight to another  country for mine, though when we went she would complain quite a bit  sometimes and was just not feeling a connection. I started noticing  patterns where there was always something wrong in a given situation. I  also noticed a dislike towards men. Shortly before Covid, I was feeling  behind again and truly opening my eyes to how I need to improve myself  in all areas of life. However, that for me was coming out in a somewhat  depressive state. I could not socialise or do much. All I wanted to do  is educate myself for that I missed in the past few years where I did  not put an effort to improve. I felt unable to give her anything in that  relationship anymore. She broke up with me right as I started seeing a  therapist, after giving me passive aggressive behavior for a while. I  was surprised and I partially agreed. She kept saying how she is unsure  and she wants me to go off and improve and we could reconcile or  whatever. I could smell sth sketchy going on but I really needed that me  time so we broke it off. We met a party that weekend and I did not  handle the social aspect of it well and she was being cold. Cut to 5  days later she phones me to hang out. I thought it'd be alright. Nothing  happened. After that hangout she would text me loads and even try to  seduce me. I gave in and we ended up making up and having sex. The next  day she springs on me she had sex with someone right after breaking up  with me and told me she's not feeling well and doesn't know what she's  doing in life and all that jazz. I was so surprised and disappointed I  did not know how to respond.I was shouting at her but she begged me to  give her another chance. At that point I did not put my foot down(should  have done that a few times before) So I went with it again. I thought  she was an alright person. Then Covid happened, things halted and I was  actually feeling a bit more relaxed and caught up with a lot things and  activities I wanted to catch up. For her, however, not long after  lockdown began the headaches began as well. Trouble with family,  flatmate and all that. Day in, day out, crying in my ear. We opened a  bit emotionally which was nice but that did not last long.  I tried some  boundaries which worked sometimes but still. We even went out with her  dad and she would end up drinking too much and using substances to keep  herself afloat. She would constantly complain to me about him. She would  talk to me about marriage and things of that nature and I would say I  do not want to put the cart before the horse and to take it easy. She  would immediately want to break up if we did not get married in the  future.\n\nShe would still tell me  she loved me and that I was important to her, however, one week after  that she texted me saying she got drunk and had sex with someone else  for a 'thrill'. At that point I immediately called the whole thing off,  got my things off her and stopped talking to her. She got in touch a  month later (after having removed her braces) and wanted to talk. I  thought it might be okay to talk. She said she had anxious attachment  style and that I was avoidant. I felt like I was being avoidant cause  the way she loved was too 'suffocating'. I felt like I had to always  entertain her or try too hard. We ended up having sex and she was crying  to me in the end saying she loved me and did not want me to say it  back. Then three days later she told me I was not giving her enough(not  cooking enough variety of foods to her or giving her social media  attention) which is why she felt like I was not making her happy and why  she did not respect me. I did not want anymore arguing so I told her  'whatever works for you'. I was still way too nice to her(even offered  her food I was wanting to make for her birthday which was around that  time). She followed me on instagram with her new profile at that point  and I unfollowed her almost immediately. She started posting pictures of  her with her dad being all friendly all of a sudden. Shortly after that  point, I asked her out on a walk to catch up and she said its too early  for her. I then phoned her on my birthday cause I missed her and she  said she is still not ready. Shouldnt have done that but I felt like  that was my genuine emotions. After that I kept on reading and looking  back on our past and how much of a doofus I had been and how much I did  not actually need her. We might have actually been holding each other  back. Ironically though many friends tell me that relationship changed  me for the better. I now got a job in an industry I want to be in after  striving for months, making money and meeting nice folks, as well as  working on myself. I did unfortunately stumble on her profile recently  though and saw  a picture of her with another guy. Nothing too  suggestive but made me feel like going back several steps in my  improvement . I also saw she posted a bunch of pictures I took of her  over the time we were together and would just post them and even being  saucy with some of them. That felt disrespectful to me and  and decided  to unfriend her and cut her off completely.For the last couple weeks  though, she has been on my mind loads. It has been a year but I kind of  go between missing her and hating her for how much she disrespected me.  On another note of irony, after I broke up with her, a couple common  friends we have told me she was being abnoxious and a bit narcissistic.  It hurts seeing her changing(even if it could be for show?) and it also  hurts feeling that she just doesnt care at all about me anymore( She did  not even bother sending me Happy New Year, I did just to be civil).\n\nI  was experiencing this for the first time in a relationship (I've had a  few of them but not this volatile) but its weird and somehow fascinating  the amount of emotions I went through. It also saddens me how I'm  sometimes thinking I liked or miss someone because they were a bit  'broken in some places'.

Before taking the exam you will be given a form to fill your choice of universities in order of appeal. Then you will be assigned to a university based on your score.\n\nAlso when you get into a university you will learn common courses then take a final exam and if you scored good you will be allowed to learn what ever was your choice else you will be assigned a field that the government think is lacking man-power.\n\nAlso if they assigned you a field that you don't want then you have to start learning at private colleges by yourself or finish learning that course\n\nPrivate colleges are not really expensive in my country. And they are treated as second class citizens in the learning environment.\n\nSo the place i was placed was a good place but the regional gov there was(still is) in conflict with the federal gov so i couldn't go. I registered and started learning at private college around where i was living. After about two months the government decided to reassign the ppl who where assigned to that region to others. So i had to options go to that university then learn a freshman course then hope i will be assigned the field i want or continue learning here at private college.\n\nSo my family offered to pay for private colleges and pressured me to stay here.I will be learning the field that i want and i think it's one year less than the public one.

Having stretches of time where you\u2019re less sharp than what you\u2019d like to be are a normal part of life - learning to navigate these situations where your life doesn\u2019t look like what you want is an integral part of living. Understanding how to efficiently manage these situations can be the difference between having a short productivity hiccup versus falling down a downward spiral that ends up in alcoholism and homelessness.\n\nIn this essay I\u2019m going to explain what is that makes snapping out of a losing streak so difficult, as well as give you an actionable, step-by-step plan to reliably break the cycle. The following is advice that will help you for the rest of your life.\n\n**The main challenge of a losing streak**\n\nWhy is getting back on your feet so difficult after you\u2019ve been taking a few L\u2019s? Some may say that the negative momentum created by the situation makes it harder to get back on track. That\u2019s absolutely true - if for the past 2 months you\u2019ve been going to bed at 4am because you\u2019ve been binging Netflix series it\u2019s going to be very difficult to suddenly go to sleep at 10pm.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d like to propose an alternative response. Maybe the reason for not being able to act like a winner is because you\u2019re no longer thinking the way a winner would.\n\nThe human mind is a wonderful tool; it is also one of the most deceptive tools there is. Convincing yourself that something is real is one of the most shockingly easy tasks there is. It is so easy in fact, that most frameworks you could use to structure your thoughts will eventually become real if given enough time of residence inside your mind. This is not manifestation, this is not new age rah-rah. It is a simple function of the brain - your mind will constantly look at its subconscious beliefs and select external events that match them. In the process, your subconscious beliefs will become stronger, and you\u2019ll identify them more as reality. In this way, your mind is akin to a sponge.\n\nNow, the pernicious problem with being stuck in a cycle of losses is that your thought patterns begin to resemble those of a loser\u2019s. Whenever you try to snap yourself out of the cycle of L\u2019s, you find yourself sliding back. Why is that?\n\nSimply put, you\u2019re trying to treat symptoms. One of the ways people try to get out of the downward spiral is by acting like what they remember they were acting when they were winning. They try to put on a show of confidence; they crack jokes and work hard. Yet it all goes back to the baseline of losing within two weeks. It\u2019s like running up a mud hill.\n\n**The fact is that you can\u2019t fake being a baller when you\u2019re on a losing streak because you don\u2019t think the way a baller does.**\n\nYou can recognise a loser\u2019s mindset pretty easily if you know what to look for. If you\u2019ve been on a losing streak, you\u2019ll be able to tell based on how dense your energy is and what you are preoccupying yourself with. Here\u2019s a few of the patterns you\u2019ll find your mind drift towards while in this mode:\n\n* being mad at people for them not rising up to your expectations\n* being envious of others, despising people for moving up in the world and instinctively belittling them; feeling threatened by their success\n* feeling like success is not attainable, that successful people must be cut from a different cloth\n* being overly suspicious of the intentions of others; feeling like everybody wants to take advantage of you and trick you, or that people are purely egoistical\n* enforcing boundaries in an overly aggressive, uncalibrated manner\n* jealous, codependent behaviour in relationships; failure to draw boundaries when necessary and walk away\n* in a conversation, your mind tends to drift towards how you can impress the person in front of you or get their validation. Feeling like you must \u201cdo something\u201d in order for people to like you. General social anxiety and low self esteem\n* when being presented with an opportunity, your mind tends to drift towards the associated risks and difficulties\n* if left in an empty, plain room, without any way to entertain or distract yourself, you feel very uncomfortable\n\n**What\u2019s the difference between a loser and a winner?**\n\nThe main difference between a winner\u2019s and a loser\u2019s pattern of thinking ultimately lays in how they go about managing resources, effort and time.\n\nCarefully read the list of loser-specific thought patterns above one more time and see if you can find anything that links them. It\u2019s pretty subtle, but the common thread is this:\n\n*A loser thinks primarily of protecting what he already has.*\n\nThe scenarios above all deal with some sort of perceived loss - be it loss of social status, self image or resources. The scenarios all present threats to the status quo - a friend no longer being involved in the friendship, the threat of not being perceived as \u201ccool\u201d in your social circle, the threat of a significant other leaving you for someone else, or simply the threat of no longer being stimulated or feeling good.\n\nAnother interesting matter to pay attention to is how losers go about gaining resources, be them material or social. Their strategy primarily relies on taking from others - they\u2019ll ultimately think that transactions are zero-sum games; in order for me to win, you must lose. Therefore they\u2019ll focus on being the winners in all transactions. When you hang out with a loser you\u2019ll notice how he always manages to divert the conversation to something going on in his life (even if the topic is mundane). Why is that? Because he thinks that in order to gain social approval, he must TAKE it from you. So, in order to do that, he bombards you with bits from his life that he thinks you\u2019ll find impressive. People who try to subtly flex are usually massive losers.\n\n*A loser\u2019s main approach to gaining value is by taking it from other people.*\n\nIn summary, the difference between winners and losers is how they manage loss and how they go about gaining value.\n\n**How does a winner think?**\n\nWhile studying the profile of a loser, we\u2019ve looked at two dimensions of his behaviour: How he manages his existing resources and how he goes around getting more. When looking at how a winner structures his thoughts, we\u2019ll study the same two dimensions.\n\nRemember - the loser was mainly preoccupied with protecting the resources that he already has. In stark contrast, the winner does not concern themselves with protection nearly to the same degree. Instead, winners look at creating more of what they want instead of holding onto what they already have.\n\nTake the example given earlier - if a friend of a winner started acting distant and aloof towards him, the winner will of course feel hurt and disappointed . The difference lays in what happens next - The loser will, as mentioned earlier, get mad at the friend and ruminate over how much of an asshole and traitor he is. The winner, on the other hand, will think of ways to meet new people that will make better friends.\n\nIf a girl acts disinterested or bitchy towards our winner, does he respond by chasing her? No, he\u2019ll focus on meeting more girls.\n\nIf a winner sees their friends attain success greater than his own, does he get defensive in an attempt to \u201csave face\u201d and protect his self image? Of course not; he\u2019ll be happy and celebrate the friend, all while using the event as fuel for his motivation.\n\nThis contrast can be encapsulated in a very popular dichotomy that circulates around self help groups - **Abundance vs. Scarcity** mindsets.\n\nSummarised, the loser is concerned with keeping what he has, the winner is focused on getting more of what he wants.\n\nThe second part of the comparison is in my view the most important.\n\n**How winners go about gathering value**\n\nWe\u2019ve established that losers\u2019 strategy for gaining value is by trying to take it away from other people. This is not only ineffective, but also counterproductive; people catch on to this behaviour very quickly and instinctively respond in a negative manner. People don\u2019t really like takers.\n\nSo, what do winners do?\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember our roots. We come from small, 150-people tribes. The dynamics in those small groups shaped us on a deeper level that we can possibly imagine. Our social structures are built around the same ideas that generated success in these small tribes. Can you guess what the archetypal successful tribe person behaved like?\n\nIt\u2019s not aggressive and loud. This idea runs rampant around circles concerned with evolutionary behaviourism, and although it does have niches in which it works, it\u2019s not the ideal strategy. What is it then?\n\n*The person who is most successful in any social setting is the one who contributes the most.*\n\nThis is one of the most important ideas I have ever come across, and unless you have very insightful parents or mentors, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll find it dissected and studied much. It might be thrown around under the guise of certain platitudes such as \u201ctry to be helpful\u201d or \u201csharing is caring\u201d, but rarely is the SHEER POWER of this idea ever discussed.\n\nDo you want to be successful, popular and rich? If yes, adhere to the following advice religiously and you\u2019ll get there sooner than you can imagine:\n\n*Starting from this moment, make sure that any person who interacts with you gains value by being in your presence.*\n\nWhat does this mean? It\u2019s simple:\n\n* If you\u2019re going out with a friend make sure he has fun.\n* If you see a mate while hitting the clubs and he seems kindof lonely and out of it, approach a girl and later introduce her to him. Let him have her.\n* You see a homeless person on the street? Buy them some food.\n* You work as a marketing expert? Share your best knowledge on Youtube or Twitter, for free\n* Go on Twitter and figure out what the best ways to get followers are, then share the knowledge with everyone else\n\nand so on\u2026\n\nContributing touches a very deep chord in our psyche. By feeling like we\u2019ve genuinely contributed towards the success of the tribe, we start to feel deserving of success. Barriers we built around our goals, barriers that stopped us from attaining our desires, are suddenly lifted. We see a cute girl on the street, and it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re no longer that anxious about meeting her; we feel like we\u2019re good people that deserve a good shot.\n\nBut won\u2019t this mean that you\u2019ll give all your value away for free? If I\u2019m a marketing expert and I give out all my advice for free, won\u2019t I lose all the clients that would have signed up for my consultancy call? Won\u2019t I lose all my leverage?\n\nThe *Reciprocation Bias* is one of the most powerful instincts inhabiting the human mind. It\u2019s the very glue that holds the foundations of human society together. If it didn\u2019t exist, the human as a social animal wouldn\u2019t either. When someone does us a favour, we feel a powerful urge to repay it (as long as we don\u2019t feel like the person has helped us specifically to put us in their debt).\n\nBut there are so many holes you can poke in this argument\n\n**How do you help someone and hope they repay you, while also not making them feel like you\u2019re manipulating them?**\n\nThis one is easy. You don\u2019t help any one person in hopes of them, as a specific individual, will repay you. You help people while holding the faith that by extending your contribution to as large of a number of people as you can, that your efforts will be repaid. And they always are.\n\n**What if people just take whatever value I provide and they never return the favour?**\n\nDoes it really matter? By engaging in this form of behaviour, you\u2019ll be more successful than you can imagine. The type of person that does not reciprocate will hold on to whatever value they got from you and barely get much else. Who\u2019s the real winner here?\n\n**But help should be offered for its own sake - Success shouldn\u2019t be a motivator for helping other people**\n\nWho would you want to have success among us? If I were to choose, I\u2019d give all the power to those that contribute the most, those that are most helpful to the largest amount of people.\n\n**Important Note**\n\nDo not give value to people that have no intention of reciprocating. I\u2019m not talking about homeless people, or other people that literally cannot reciprocate, but about selfish friends. You are not elevating yourself above the pettiness of expecting a reward for your help by doing this; all you\u2019re doing is uselessly lowering your status while enforcing a bad behaviour on their part. Don\u2019t feel obliged to give anything to any one person; your value is a privilege that not everybody has access to by default.\n\n**So, after all that. How do I get out of a losing streak?**\n\nThe rest of the essay should give a good idea of how to achieve that, but if you just want an actionable list of steps you want to take, or maybe just a **tl;dr**, here it goes:\n\n1. Focus on small wins. Get winning right now. Take out the trash, take a shower then go get dressed up in a nice shirt. Hit the gym, trim your eyebrows. The key about small wins is that they naturally lead into bigger wins. You need to get into the mindset of chasing more favourable outcomes as opposed to protecting what you already have. Focus on small wins for two weeks straight and your life will look radically different.\n2. Contribute - be as useful as you can to as large a number of people as possible. Read the section above for more details as to why this could be the most important idea that you read.\n\nThere\u2019s a few other things that I could go over, but these are the basics. Stick to these for a few days and you won\u2019t only snap out of your losing streak, but you\u2019ll likely ride one of the most successful waves of your life.", "title": "How to break a Losing Streak.

For example, I may want to be disciplined to work out every single day. Yet, how many times do we make it a month, day, hour, minute before giving up or forgetting out goals.\n\nHere, I am suggesting that self-discipline need not only be developed by your self. One way to be self-disciplined is to seek out a teammate. Having a good teammate to hold you accountable may be what is needed to help get you closer to your goals. The end goal is to not be dependent, but to start building the habits needed to get you closer to your dreams. Having a teammate that cares about you and your success, who can provide tips and strategies, and hold you accountable can be invaluable for this.\n\nThis is why sales companies have team meetings, and check-ins with their representatives. These meetings happen monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily. The meetings are a way to keep the minds of all the members aligned on big-picture goals, and the check-ins are to see where each individual is at mentally and problems they\u2019re dealing with. It\u2019s an opportunity for the team to recharge their enthusiasm and efforts towards their personal goals in alignment with the organizations.\n\nSome days you simply may not feel like pursuing the goals you previously set for yourself or may simply forget. For example, you set the goal to be positive today. On your way to work someone cuts you off while driving which sets you off and you forget about the goal for the day. Possibly forget it for the foreseeable future. If you have a teammate that reminds you of your goal, it\u2019s a way of forcing that thought back into your consciousness. You also won\u2019t want to let down your teammate.\n\nChoosing your teammate is key and be cautious because it may negatively affect your relationship. For example, I can tell my friend to hold me accountable to wake up early every day. I tell him to call me at 6:30 am every morning, assuming he does that anyway, and he agrees. I fail a few times and he reminds me later in the day, it\u2019s good. However, it\u2019s easy to become annoyed with these reminders, even though you previously wanted them. Perhaps he is delivering the reminder in a poor way that comes off as nagging rather than a gentle nudge back into your goals. Ultimately it is your goal to not completely give up. A teammate will only push you so far, most people aren\u2019t willing to risk harming the relationship so you can accomplish your goals. This is why a third party (therapist, coach, counsellor, manager, etc.) work well to hold you accountable because they can take a somewhat unattached approach and judge your progress and not you as a person.\n\nHowever, there is no doubt that talking to people about your goals and having them hold you accountable is a nice safety net. One, it refocuses your mind on your goals, keeps them in your mind. Second, it allows them to catch you and remind you of why you are doing what you are doing when you simply get caught up with life. Third, it\u2019s nice knowing you\u2019re not alone on your journey. Lastly, even when you are hitting your goals, it\u2019s nice to get feedback and information when you find yourself at a roadblock. Sometimes discussing the problems aloud or hearing different perspectives reduces the size or strength of the problem.\n\n&gt;Now, I am playing with the thought of starting a consulting/coaching business. I do already have a few clients in real life but would like to experiment with a few people here. Let\u2019s have daily (or weekly) meetings for, preferably on discord and in the mornings, to align our goals, strategize, and hold each other accountable. At this point I\u2019ll take 2 or 3 people, so if you\u2019re interested in having a teammate for whatever your goals are send me a DM.

I could just play LoL for months 3 to 4 hours a day after the jobs forgetting that with a little luck I had the potential to own my music label or build my startup maybe even produce some video game. But once in a while I just get that jab that I'm wasting my potential and I could do something to better the world by example. I got the brain to become a lead scientist if I could effort into it. But in the end, would I really make a difference because I could also watch another season another show and forget about all those problems I force on myself for a bit. 3 months later I wake up remembering that the project I have put on ice is now an iceberg.

Now please let me return to my boring lonely life so I can continue to forget the waste of potential I am.\n\nBref, I don't know if you were able to catch what my headspace looks like but I'll go with the concrete anyway. At the start, of September, I've restarted my studies full time after about 30 mounts of professional life. Last semester(spring), I've tested myself with a 2 courses semester question of seeing if I still had the capacity to study. Not gonna lie, it was almost catastrophic for the 2 last weeks of the semester I didn't touch my book and was saved because it was about things I've seen like 3 years ago during my never-finished computer science degree. Now we are a month into the new semester and I'm about a week and a half late in all my classes. \n\nMy head is screaming at me to just drop it all and cry myself to sleep for a day or two and just forget about everything. But I can't just drop, the drop without cost is already past and I can't just waste 2000$ (yeah I know, it is relatively cheap for university). But in the end, if I dropped my class I could just restart working full time and I would do 2000$ in 2 weeks, so in the end, I would only have wasted 2 weeks and not 4 months like I'm going to do.\n\nAnd when I'll get my paper, what will I do with it. I'm studying to go into the music/entertainment industry, a freelancer industry. How someone with the ambition of a middle-class dad doing 7 to 5 could survive in this industry. But this is what I have the most fun doing and what I am probably the least bad at.  And it's not like I could rely on people, I've got nobody around me. And I cannot go sell myself to other people, I've no redeeming quality due to the fact that I've not touched my instruments in the last 5 years because I didn't had any ambition to pursue music as a career. And I still don't want to be a musician, I aim to become a project manager and shoot other projects to the moon. But how can a project manager manage projects if there is nobody around him to have a project? I also can't do projects by myself because I would need to have the pressure of learning the technic to perform the project in addition to managing it.\n\nBref, I need to find ambition so I could have the drive to propel myself sky-high and finally stop feeling like a 6' high pile of wasted potential.\n\nThanks for listening to my Ted rant.", "title": "How could I stop wasting my potential?"}, {"created_utc": 1632610173, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/", "num_comments": 105, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys.

Since then it's been me and my 78 year old mother moving together to a home, but me being deeply depressed, feeling like a loser and ashamed that I can't take care of my angel of a mother or myself for that matter. The drinking has been less but its once every few months I go on a 2-3 day oblivion bender. Enough is enough, I am very aware how much of a life or death situation this has become for me. I need to get help and put all my effort into healing or I don't think I have much more fight in me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone can give me any advice, be it good books to read, or if you were in somewhat of a similar situation it would mean the world to me, feeling quite pathetic at the moment.", "title": "Trying to get up again"}, {"created_utc": 1632577676, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pv736b/83_questions_to_troubleshoot_your_life/", "num_comments": 34, "score": 1, "selftext": "These prompts might uncover some painful baggage you haven\u2019t looked at in a while. If something really resonates, write a comment about it. Myself or other readers might have advice/books/podcasts that helped us with a similar problem. All of these are issues I\u2019ve struggled with so I guarantee you are not alone.\n\n**Your Needs**\n\nWhen was the last time you asked for your needs to be met? When was the last time someone did something for you? How did it feel? How does it feel now that your needs are not being met? Would anything bad happen if you asked now? If something bad did happen, what would that tell you? Do you want to be involved with people or coworkers that don't care about your needs? If your needs are rejected isn't that a sign you should make changes in your life so your needs can be met? What would it feel like to have people that cared a lot about meeting your needs and did not resent you for asking? Is it worth a few uncomfortable conversations to change your environment and go find those people?\n\n**Your Happy Place**\n\nWhat kinds of things make you truly happy? When was the last time you did them? If you committed to doing one of those things over the next week no matter what, how could you make it happen? What is the worst case scenario of what would happen if you did that? Would anyone be seriously offended you took time for yourself? Would anything bad happen you couldn't fix? Would you be happy you made the time down the road? Could it maybe give you good perspective about how much these things mean to you, and help you prioritize better in the future?\n\n**Shower Arguments**\n\nWho do you argue with the most in your head? What do they say to you, and you to them? How much do these mental conversations resemble your real interactions with them? Do you imagine them saying awful things to you when they do it only infrequently in real life? Do your mental versions of them reflect who they really are or just how they made you feel at times in the past? How much good has come from these shower arguments? How much time have you spent focused on that instead of something more pleasant? Would you prefer to be thinking of pleasant things instead? Is it worth trying to learn skills like mindfulness so you can recognize these when they happen and choose other actions?\n\n**Comfort Zone**\n\nWhen was the last time you got outside your comfort zone? Have you found new experiences to be helpful in the past? Did they show you new things you enjoyed, or give you a new perspective? Did they help you bond with people you care about? Have those experiences gone well more often than they've gone poorly? What have you been meaning to try? What is the worst case scenario if you do?\n\n**Social Anxiety**\n\nWhat things would you like to do but you have social anxiety? What meetups or new experiences have you heard good things about but you're terrified of how people might judge you or be unkind? Have you done things even though you were socially anxious in the past? Did anything bad happen that you couldn't recover from? Even if you try something and it's awkward, does it cost you anything in a way you can't recover from? Have you tried these in the past and felt nervous but had significant benefits once you did it? If the cost is something you can recover from and it might have a big benefit, then why not try it out?\n\n**Rekindle Old Friendships**\n\nAre there people you use to get along with really well but haven't talked to recently? Would you like it if they reached out to you to catch up? What is the worst case scenario if you reached out to them? They would probably feel the same excitement if you took the initiative to reach out. It might be sad if they ghosted you how happy would you be to rekindle that friendship? Would that be easier than meeting brand new people? Do you think you can take 60 seconds to say you miss them and would like to catch up in person or over a call? Can you message 5 people? How awesome would it be to get even one \u201cYes!\u201d?\n\n**Too Busy To Feel**\n\nHow do you feel when you don't have anything to work on or keep you busy? Is it pleasant? Do you feel frantic? Do you need to be busy and feel productive to be comfortable? Why do you have to feel productive to feel good about yourself?\n\n**Timesucks**\n\nIs there an activity that consistently eats up much of your time? Do you get anything out of it? How do you feel when you finish it?\n\n**Self Worth**\n\nWhere do you get your self worth from? Is it a job, attention from others, social media, a title, or some other external validation? How consistent and secure is that self worth? Are there times the rug gets pulled out and you feel awful? Are you able to see self worth in yourself outside of these external factors? Do you feel like you're good enough even without any of that validation?\n\nWhat about yourself can you not accept? What parts aren't good enough? Are they things that you think can be improved? Most are. But can you accept that this is where you are today, and that accepting where you are is the first step to taking steps forward? How would you feel if you were good enough? If you didn\u2019t have to change anything about yourself to be ok? Learning to accept yourself will get you there.\n\n**Alone With Your Thoughts**\n\nHow do you feel when you're alone? When you're not checking off a to-do list. When you're just being present, alone with your thoughts. Is that scary? What uncontrollable thoughts come up? What activities do you usually reach for to distract yourself? What could you read, journal, discuss with a friend, or practice to make this introspection time less scary? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to enjoy sitting still, rather than distracting yourself constantly? \n\n**Monkey On Your Back**\n\nIs there something that's been distressing you or causing you pain for a long time? Can you get therapy or try a therapy book? Other people have tools that could help you break through this plateau.\n\n**Your Discontent**\n\nWhat changes do you think you need in your life to be happy? How many of those changes are not under your control? Can you continue like this knowing that when you feel happy is not up to you? Why are those things essential for your happiness? Is there a different path you haven't considered that could be fulfilling for you? One where you have more control over your own destiny?\n\n**Your Support System**\n\nDo you feel alone? Can you connect with others? Is there someone you could call right now who would answer the phone and listen? Even if you haven\u2019t been vulnerable with each other in the past, would it feel good to get this out of your head a little? When was the last time you leaned on someone like this?

I have social anxiety, and currently in therapy for it. I improved a lot in college since I get a lot more comfortable with people when I'm forced to be around them, not sure if others are the same. So it went back down in the toilet during the pandemic. I've been here for almost 2 years now, I can't remember the last time I had plans. I have one good friend from college who lives several state away. I just sit at home and hang out with my parents (who I love dearly and I'm very grateful to spend time with them). But the reality is I'm too scared to leave. \n\nI daydream every single day about what it would be like to move to a brand new city and to meet new people. It consumes hours of my day fantasizing about this - meeting a great group of friends, finding a loving boyfriend,  having a kick-ass career, and a beautiful apartment. I feel at peace when fantasizing about it, but when it comes to actually taking steps to try to make it a reality, I freeze from terror. \n\nAn example being that I had 2 job interviews this week - 1 with a Chicago company and one with an NYC company.

I have been spending the past few days to think through things that trigger my anxiety and trying to change the narrative. But I always hit a block when it comes to being drawn to unavailable relationships. I never understood when people say we model the attachment styles we were brought up with but today I finally got it. Sharing some pointers I wrote down so don\u2019t mind if they seem disjointed: \n\nUnavailable relationships play out the same dynamics as my childhood. I always felt like nobody looked out for me, so I needed to take care of myself. I needed to watch out for myself, clean up after myself. It was difficult to show my emotions because if I didn\u2019t show it, then perhaps it would justify why mom and dad didn\u2019t help me or care about me. Maybe by shutting off from the world I could protect myself and provide for myself. ie I used to have bad diarrhoea in the mornings. I had to endure long bus rides and always had to run to the toilet and sometimes not making it. I would quietly wear soiled underwear for the whole day (I was 9 and nobody told me I could just throw the damn underwear away) and not speaking up until someone asked me. I always felt misunderstood and there has always been difficulty speaking up. I grew up and became fiercely independent, never asking for help and always maintaining independence. \n\nHow this plays out in my relationships: I am fiercely independent but deep down very needy. Sometimes I swing to extremes. Explosive sharing of needs or quiet suffering once again. Absorbing all my emotional needs and not communicating them because if I don\u2019t communicate them perhaps it would justify why they are not met. Still feel like my needs are too much and therefore I am drawn to people who confirm that about me. \n\nSelf sabotage happens when I still suppress those emotional needs and ignore physical needs (staying up late, saying yes when I mean no) to sustain the relationship and connection, and protect myself by pretending I don\u2019t have those needs. \n\nI\u2019m just mind blown right now.

Maybe social media is good for you and that's ok.\n\nNot so long ago I made a post here about my journey to make my life better. Deleting all my social media was a part of it. I notices that it is better not to do things that \"makes you feel good in one moment but then you feel like shit\". Sugar, smoking, fast food. And social media, of course.\n\nWhat have I noticed:\n\n1. 99% of my \"friends\" in Instagram or Facebook don't care about me. They don't even noticed I don't use my social media account for half a year. I left contacts (messenger and phone) to everyone, but only 2 people wished me happy birthday, 1 guy called 3 days later and said if I want to have a walk. Also 3 people, who don't even remember about me for years, asked me for a favor. I said no.\n2. I realised I don't want to see any posts on social media. Seriously, I don't care. You had a journey to islands, got a car, made a painting, eat healthy. It is not interesting for me. It is your life, it's not a part of my life, I am not a part of your life. Damn, I don't really care what my real friends post on social media. Instead I'll welcome them to my appartment, we'll have some tea, share stories, they'll show me some pictures. Maybe we'll have a trip to the nature. You know, real communication, not this \"phone-sex\" friendship.\n3. Attention span. Damn, it was a real problem for me. Now I can concentrate for more than 20 seconds. Once again I enjoy reading, just like when I was 10 reading \"Treasure Island\" or \"Harry Potter\" after school.\n4. I become more confident and happy. I read many arcticles about links that depression and low self-esteem has with social media. I think it is true. Not so many \"likes\"? Feels bad. Now approval of 350 people has no influence on me. It is only me now to compare.\n5. Before quitting social media there was always something to feel sad about. Oh, this guy is 5 years younger and he is more succesful. That person with whom I went to school is traveling around Europe, having very interesting journeys. This guy has perfect relationships. Everyone is better than me, live more happy life. Why I was using social media for years if it felt so bad? I don't know.\n6. FOMO. Now it is just 4 letters, not an anxiety that I miss something, sitting at home.\n7. And right now a realisation that hits like a nail in my head. **It was not even fun**. I was wasting my time for years on thing, that doesn't gave me fun or joy. Something a little-bit exciting, but not fullfilling.

My childhood was pretty decent(except death of father when 4). So to provide for us my mom departed for the  USA and left me under the guardianship of my granny. I was really good at school mainly due to the fact that we got whooped thoroughly if we underperformed. So that fear kept me in line and my grades up. Fast forward freshman year of highschool I was 15 and a deviant teenager just like most teenagers and I became desensitized to the whoopings just like a hardened criminal would. Even if I got whooped it didn't phase me no more. That period in time was also when my p*rn and masturbation addiction began.\n\nAnd one of my great and numerous regrets is that I seeked acceptance and validation from my peers in HS. In the process becoming a class clown. And as you can predict by the end of sophomore year my grades were slipping down a slippery slope. My poor mom who was working 2-3 jobs to take care of us and who already had enough stress of her own, was getting worried and anxious for me. However, none of that mattered to me at the time.\n\nIn my senior year of HS my mom got me a Visa to come and live with her in the states since I was old enough to discern right from wrong and not be easily influenced just like a typical, cautious and conservative African parent's thought process would suggest. I experienced a huge culture shock when I got here, everything was different. The accent, the date format and even units of measurement. Overnight I found myself in a whole different continent. \n\nI stayed at home my first 4 months waiting for my documents to be processed. It was in this time I went from weighing 138 lbs to 210 lbs mind you am 5'7. I was overweight for the first time in my life. All within the space of 4-6 months. I was at home binging on nutella, chicken, milk you name it. My confidence and self esteem took a huge dive.\n\nI also developed a severe phone addiction, would you believe me if I told you I averaged 15+ hrs of screen time daily since 2017.  Through this I have been sleep depraved for the past 4 years. And my sleep deprivation started affecting me cognitively. I can't recall and store some memories and it even affected my balance, my fingers and feet involuntarily tremor. Despite all of this I am still not able to stop.\n\nAnother effect that trickled down from this chain reaction is that I developed a personality and speech disorder. Previously I was the textbook definition of extroversion. I was super social, I had like 100 friends growing up, was never afraid to approach someone and start a meaningful conversation. But now talking to a person seems like a gargantuan task. Am second guessing myself and then opting out of talking and asking questions. Anxiety was a foreign concept to me but now it's ingrained in my daily life. I have been here 4 years and yet to make a single friend.\n\nMy anxiety and phone addiction then turned to procrastination. I was putting off school work. Last fall semester I had a calculus class with a professor who I was familiar with. I took a previous stats class with him. My phone addiction and procrastination almost failed me that class. I had a C in midterm but I pulled my bootstraps in the final quarter and got an A. Thanks to the teacher dropping the lowest test grade and extending a crucial homework deadline. I got lucky. Imagine if that didn't happened. There were several classes that I would have aced if only I had put in a little bit of effort. \n\nAs of right now, as I type this it's 6.50 a.m and I got a class at 11.00 but yet am glued to my phone watching endless YouTube and surfing the net. I get visions of what am destined for sometimes and what am capable of achieving but without actions they remain only visions. I know what am supposed to do to make things right but it feels like am under some invisible mental shackles that I can't break from. The other day I came across a snapchat memories that I posted in December of 2018 that read the following. \"Am closing all my social media accounts and getting rid of my smart phone by JAN 14. The amount of time and energy I spent on my phone this year is crazy tbh I don't know how 2018 went by.\" Reading this had me in my feelings and bawling out. It's been 3 years since I posted that and nothing changed.\n\nI haven't had a job in a year. Overweight, low confidence, super anxious and confined to bed. Might I  also add a porn and masturbation addict. My brain juices are fucked. My dopamine levels are maxed. Am super disgusted with myself. If you told me I would be reduced to this 4 years ago I would have laughed you off. Am a shell of a person. A failure as of right now.\n\nAny tips, advice and suggestions would be highly appreciated.

Always ahead of the game, I put a disgustingly large amount of effort into school. Won multiple state and national awards for computer science and was captain of my robotics team. Was I tired and sad constantly, working late hours on homework because I couldn\u2019t bring myself to sustain my attention long enough to the point where it look me 2 hours to finish something that would normally take someone 15 minutes? Did I have like three friends and usually nobody to talk to? Of course. Incessantly burnt out and waiting painfully for the ending? Was my mental health at an all time low constantly? Yeah! I cried tears of relief knowing it was all over at graduation.\n\nExcept it\u2019s not.\n\nI\u2019m really struggling in college (I\u2019m not even at my goal college I was accepted into because of costs, felt like giving up my dream and a far better and not outdated program, but I also don\u2019t want to be in debt). I\u2019m struggling socially, academically, and with my overall health. It\u2019s embarrassing and I\u2019m not entirely sure what to do at this point.\n\nI\u2019m doing great in only half of my classes and completely failing the others. I\u2019m too afraid to ask my professors for help because I haven\u2019t exactly been doing my homework or anything to help myself like going to the tutoring center and whatnot. I still might though, because I think it\u2019s better to do something than nothing at all. I\u2019ve had intentions to, but ran out of time/couldn\u2019t find a good time/got too distracted.\n\nMy anxiety is somehow the best and the worst it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s not intense, but it lingers longer. My room is constantly a mess. I\u2019m not eating three meals a day (and when I eat it\u2019s mostly junk) because I forget or it just doesn\u2019t happen because I\u2019d rather do something else. I\u2019ve gained so much weight. Keeping survival habits like eating, drinking water, even knowing when to use the bathroom feels like a full time job, leaving me with little time to do homework. I have bills to pay so I can\u2019t just quit my job or ask for less hours.\n\nI have five friends that can get their own shit together and function a hell of a lot better than I can so they aren\u2019t ever available to talk and I can\u2019t make any more because I\u2019m constantly trying to catch up on my assignments so I can\u2019t attend clubs and events. Found out a couple days ago that one of my friends is terminally ill and could die at any moment or a lot sooner in life, which I\u2019ll keep in the back of my mind but I feel there\u2019s no situation to think about that since she\u2019s feeling fine right now. I had some sort of fwb situation (just in terms of everything but intercourse for religious reasons) but he was a terrible communicator and in his own words \u201ccouldn\u2019t give me the commitment I deserved.\u201d I like another guy in my class, but at this point I feel like I shouldn\u2019t focus on a relationship and I feel guilty for being interested in guys right now. \n\nI\u2019m assumed to have ADHD by my counselor and falling apart due to lack of structure. I\u2019ve been seeing them since the start of school says they don\u2019t know how else more to help me with that because it seems like we have tried everything and my brain doesn\u2019t stick to anything. They\u2019re trying to lead me to getting formally diagnosed and possibly on medication. It\u2019s difficult for me to do that because my parents would rather not let that happen. My brother has ADHD and was diagnosed really early. My parents did not like watching his trial and error with medication and do not want me to be helped unless it\u2019s last resort because I \u201cdon\u2019t have the time to deal with that.\u201d Which, fair, but I also can\u2019t lose my full-ride and need to sustain a 3.25 GPA, meaning I don\u2019t have the time to stay like this. That\u2019s the thing though, they don\u2019t know the situation and I\u2019m embarrassed to admit it because I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m not capable of handling myself on my own. I\u2019m also afraid it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money that I nor my parents have to be diagnosed.\n\nI was thinking of changing my major from computer science to integrated science education 6-12 with hopes for a master\u2019s in instructional technology to be a CS teacher, but I\u2019m not entirely sure I can do it. Both of my parents are teachers and the system is just so horribly broken and terrible to them. I\u2019m naturally good at this though, and I really love it, I\u2019m still not sure I could see myself doing it forever. I don\u2019t know what I could see myself doing forever. I like writing, but I don\u2019t think I could do it as a career.\n\nI know I don\u2019t need their approval to make my appointment and I let them know I was making an appointment but I didn\u2019t tell them what for, just that they already know what for. I\u2019m having a hard time taking ownership of myself and it\u2019s something I\u2019m slowly learning. I feel like my family is not as supportive of me as they were when I felt successful and had intentions to land a career in CS. I I told them about my major change and they thought it was pretty much killing any chance I had at a good life or successful future. I feel really lonely. Especially since I no longer want to go home because I feel like they lean on me a lot to tutor my brother or I do at least one thing wrong and tick someone off. It just makes me want to stay at school. They keep trying to find some way to keep me at home more which is understandable considering I\u2019m the oldest and is a them issue but I still feel bad about my boundary. They\u2019re really good people, just having a hard time with my changes.\n\nI don\u2019t know who I am, but I know nobody really ever knows that. I just look in the mirror and don\u2019t see myself, I never have. I feel like I\u2019m just chaos personified. That\u2019s what a friend called me \u201cout of love.\u201d The same friend that told someone with an active mind who can\u2019t sit still to meditate, and someone with what feels like no time to just go to the gym. \u201cJust make a schedule and stick to it, diligence is your problem. It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d Which, yeah, fair, but I feel like I\u2019m climbing Everest just to drink some water sometimes. It feels insulting when he tells me I just \u201cdon\u2019t want to be better enough\u201d when I feel like I\u2019m already doing everything I can at the best of my ability and it\u2019s miles away from enough. \n\nThe only thing my head seems to want to do is go for walks to clear itself but it never clears.\n\nMy journal where I write about everything and anything is the only thing it feels like is keeping me holding on, especially since I\u2019ve been down more because of the changing of the seasons.

I feel like I should have some of this figured out by now. I\u2019m going to take the obvious steps to take care of this (I have appointments with career services, academic advising, the tutoring centers, and plan to make one with my GP about looking into an ADHD diagnosis, though I keep putting that one off), but I just was wondering if you had suggestions as to anything that\u2019s worked to get you out of this?

It\u2019s a very confusing time. \n\nIt was Devine intervention I\u2019m sure of. I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight and have lost it. I\u2019ve conquered a lot of addictions like opioid abuse as well as stimulants. \n\nIt took a toll on me. I know my dopamine and brain is still messed up and that\u2019s why I\u2019m reaching out. \n\nI have to say I have made a lot of changes quickly. Not overnight, but a lot of baby steps turned into one giant step and I feel and think completely different. \n\nMy question is this : What can I do with my days &amp; are my days now unhealthy? \n\nI spend a lot of time texting, and looking up information online. Learning things that I\u2019ll probably never use. On google a lot. I stopped social media as far as Facebook for a long time, but I\u2019m a huge walking dead fan, and a fb group is a big part of my life and that show has helped me so much. \n\nI should be working out more as well as working on my diet. \nI had a phone phobia- I was literally so afraid to make phone calls to reach out to my insurance and just getting general information for very important things in my life ( therapy ) \n\nI always tried to use email or request information via text. \nNot sure how I had a fear of phones, but for the first time in years I can say as far as last week and what I \u201cWILL\u201d do tomorrow as far as reaching out is a 360 change. \n\nI do however have my mental problems. Generalized Anxiety Disorder. \nWith that being said right now as we speak I am typing this with a feeling throughout my whole entire body that is not pleasant. ( physical anxiety symptoms are shi*) \n\nSo online helps me. Just looking up back stories to shows I watch, information about an actress, new apps etc.  It really helps me and my anxiety.\n\nAt the moment there\u2019s a show on Hulu I am trying to catch up on. It\u2019s really hard for me to concentrate on it. Sometimes and days it\u2019s not, everyday is more or less a rollercoaster with its ups and downs. \n\nI still have a physical dependence on a product called Kratom. It used to help alleviate my anxiety only for me to realize I was self medicating and it\u2019s a problem. \n\nThat increases my anxiety now ( me fighting my urge and cravings to take it ) makes me feel so much worse. \n\nI have a close friend. She means the world to me who I spend a lot of my time texting. Also some friends on Xbox and people I am still friends with in real life so I do have people to talk to ( huge blessing ) \n\nI feel like by going online right now on my iPhone and not watching this show is a fail. Like I\u2019m doing something wrong. I am addicted to technology, but I could 100% put this phone down and not use any. It will only increase my symptoms. \n\nMy anxiety started when I was 18, I\u2019m 39 now and tomorrow I\u2019m finally calling to make a therapy appointment and take care of things. ( I procrastinated for years )\n\nI\u2019m on SSI right now. I\u2019m writing this at the perfect time because I\u2019m actually having the anxiety right now. \n\nI used to play video games everyday most of the day. That\u2019s not healthy. Also the social media I cut down on big time. \n\nI do binge watch tv too much as well. ( as I write this I feel the anxiety getting better ) Always so much on my mind and that\u2019s why I text so much and want to write everything!  I know I could be 100% worse off. \nI am on SSI right now, which sucks because I want to work. \n\nFrom 1-10 I\u2019ve changed (7.5) compared to how I was. \n\nDoes my lifestyle now sound very unhealthy? I\u2019m sober, I\u2019m not giving up and I\u2019ll fight till my death. I just want to be productive more. \n\nTomorrow I\u2019m making phone calls to do things I\u2019ve put off for so long.

But they weren't they were women in my gym. At first the signs were not so visible ( the truth is i was not observational back then)..then when i understood they were jealous me and they tried to belittle me i was not mad i just ignored them i was thinking ok they will stop...or ok they are not so annoying as long as i don't care at all for them. But as i was ignoring then they were keep trying and trying to make me feel bad for myself, trying to learn informations about me and then insult me. I have talked about that in a psychologist and he was the one that told me \"why you didn't stopped them earlier? and he told me to protect myself next time and that if you just \"leave them\" they keep trying and that i should put them limits. And believe it or not this was a traumatic even, he told me they abused me! Also i was watching a psychologist's video in youtube talking about toxic people and she said that the only way to deal with them is to be unkind. And personally this is the conclution i have also came too. So next time i understood a woman in the gym was jealous of me i was more \"agressive\" this time and i tried to show her that i know what she does. I was hoping that she would feel ashamed and she would stop, but finally she became extremely agressive, with agressive body language, she was comming really close to me. I talked about that to someone and he gave me a good advice that if you let them know that you observe everything that they do they will understand that they annoy you and then they will keep doing it to annoy you even more! He was so right. Finally when i ignored them i was wrong, when i didn't i was wrong again!\n\nExcept from lately i started working as a student in a lab in my university with a theacher (55M) as a supervisor and he was trying to make me jealous with flirting with another student in front of me......i knew it i was just not giving attention. But what drived me crazy is that i am the first student i go there in the morning while the other girl comes hours later and leaves hours later than me. And the theacher told me to get things ready for an experiment and to tell him to come when its ready. He was in PURPOSE not coming and talking with her....when i started insisting he even put his feet in a chair !!!! Like telling me he is not gonna come....\n\nI told him are you gonna come or no? He said yes i will come ......while he KNEW that in some minutes it was my time to leave! I am sure he did it in purpose cause i have also seen him staring me at areas a teacher shouldn't look at!\n\nFirst this is DISRESPECTFUL, i am not jealous of the other girl, and i also would never be cause i value myself and i know what i deserve. Also only an idiot would be jealous of a man in the age of my dad who is married with children. This underestimate my intelligence !\n\nSecond, i am SUPER TIRED every day i am just going home and sleeping and i wanna do my job and leave i don't wanna spend hours there without doing what i have to do. HE IS SPENDING MY TIME! While i also have and others courses!\n\nAnd after what happened i was so mad i strained my vocal cords from shouting ! I did not shout much but i already had sensitive vocal cords from another time i strained them but i could at least talk normally and go to the university while now i cannot and its been 2 weeks that i am resting and they still hurt. I will not have time to finish the experiments for sure in this semester i lost it !\n\nWhy i give them so much space into my head? Why did i destroyed my semester for them?\n\nI KNOW that at the time that i think about others....if they mentally abuse me, they are jealous of me, insult me etc in this hours i could have done something for me and just be happy. Like leasening to music, exercising...just look for fashion or so many others things. But why I CANNOT practically do it?\n\nThe problem is that i know its wrong i just cannot stop it.\n\nNow i stopped going for a lot of days to my uni and i feel much better and my mental health is good but this is not gonna be always the case. If i was working somewhere i could have not just stopped going if this situation was happening in my workplace. Plus i know that if the same things will happen again that i will be influenced again.\n\nI cannot find the Golden section on how to act. I know i should ignore them but when you ignore them TOO much they just continue to abuse you. If you don't stop them they don't stop.

Somehow losing my last euros made me end things, I needed a new beginning, trying new ways of getting money, that might work, finding any sort of work. Being able to breathe.\n\nToday I was feeling extremely heavy, gambling because I wanted to win back the money for my rent (typical scenario, I guess) and I lost my last 10\u20ac. In the last few years, I lost over 3000\u20ac on Bwin, for me it's a lot of money - over 4 months of paying my rent, not having it really hurts me, especially that I have to pay rent in 5 days and I have 5\u20ac on my account and a lot of debts to pay in November.\n\nIn summary, I'm broke. But I don't have the Bwin account anymore to get back to and any hope to win some money back, makes me feel slightly better. I feel horrible, but at least I don't feel this heaviness anymore, of losing my own money due to my own stupid actions.\n\nI desperately need help and s\u00fcpport, any sort of advice on how to get money, how to start working hard. I'm exhausted but I'm motivated. I want to improve my life. I'm a female, 32, a content creator, an author, a writer, I create content in form of graphical posts on social media, short promotional videos, infographics but also articles and books, I published 2 books that sometimes get sold, this is my only income. I consider myself as a rather intelligent person (despite the gambling), good at research, writing and some web development and digital marketing. I'm good at going through difficult topics (law, politics) and explaining them to others in a way that can be understandable. I also lead an online community of 5000 people that I built from scratch, I guess I'm good at building and leading communities. I was also an English teacher some time ago and can quickly learn new things. Any advice on small, quick gigs, or any motivational talk will be really appreciated.

Career. One thing that can really bring a person into depression is 40 hours a week of hating their job. The job is literally almost half of the waking life. The problem many people have is that they have a craving for security. The person will tolerate being unhappy if that is their normality. People would rather have secure bitterness than the fear of stepping off the cliff. The fact is that you can change your career anytime. At 40 or 50. I once knew a car salesman of 30 years who did really well but started to hate his job--so became a nurse at 57. He is now a travel contractor. His friends told him he would be 57 by the time he got licensed as an RN. He told them he would be 57 anyway.

I admit that I use snap filters (not the ones with animal stuff, or some crazing sparkles just the ones which smoothes the skin) because I am extremely insecure about the way I look. If you would think it\u2019s because I am overweight or obese, I am far from it (I\u2019m actually tall and thin). To explain my dating experiences.\n\nI\u2019ve met a guy on a dating app who was looking for a serious relationship. It didn\u2019t work bc I was way too shy and awkward at the date. But we had sex. Later I created a catfish account to know why he ghosted me, he told this fake account that I was nice, beautiful but boring.\n\nMonths later, I subscribed to another dating app for something not serious at all, I didn\u2019t have any expectations. I matched with a guy, with who, I had great chemistry, we even sexted. A few days later, I learned that he was actually married (he is quite much older than me, early 30s) for 7 years. I\u2019ve been in obsession with him and wanted to meet him at all costs. I\u2019ve made researches to find his real name, so I knew about his address and where he works. I\u2019ve been in front of his house just to see in what kind of house, neighborhood he lives. Later, I\u2019ve been to his job (he works in a theather as a projectionist) to tell him that I\u2019m gonna tell everything to his wife. He told me he didn\u2019t want to cheat on her anymore. Later in the conversation (I didn\u2019t threaten him), we\u2019ve been intimate and made out in the local. He told me when I actually met him that I correspond to the pictures that I sent him, that he found me too cute to resist.The story stopped there because he decided to stop his cheating behaviors. And it\u2019s better like that.\n\nNot dating app related, I\u2019ve been looking for new friends to meet in the new city I moved for my studies on twitter. A guy responded and he asked me to send him pictures of my face to see what i look like. I was only for friends not for dating!! The guy couldn\u2019t stop telling how pretty I look, how beautiful I am. I kept insisting that I am Only there for friendship. He clearly told me that he wanted to hug me, and hoped more than a friendship when he saw my pictures. So, I\u2019ve met him, we ended up in an airbnb, we didn\u2019t talk that much in the car, just because he didn\u2019t know where to go and I had no idea because I didn\u2019t know the city. I didn't find him attractive. Just right after I chose a playlist and sat on the couch, he started to pull me next to him. I told him and pushed off of him \u00ab\u00a0it\u2019s way too soon\u00a0\u00bb, and he replied \u00ab\u00a0i like you, I want you\u00a0\u00bb. Since I was lost, felt completely lonely, I stayed in his arms and imagined that I was with the \u00ab\u00a0previous married guy\u00a0\u00bb. I admit that I made out with him because I was quite horny, I turned off the lights to not have seeing his face. During the made out session, I didn\u2019t want to do certain things, I said that I regret, it shouldn\u2019t happen. I almost cried. The morning after he left, I blocked him.\n\nAround 2 weeks later (around the last 15th october), I decided to log in again in a dating app, I didn\u2019t have any expectztions. A guy sent me a \u00ab\u00a0crushnote\u00a0\u00bb to tell he he found me beautiful. I discussed with him, I insisted to meet him in a public space. So he accepted with no problem. I told him that I wasn\u2019t looking for a serious relationship, just chilling and see what will happen. That I don't think you can find a serious relationship on a dating app (I still think the same). So we chatted and we decided to see each the next evening. He picked me up in his car, we went to a rather fancy restaurant. He paid me two cocktails and for my meal. He said that he invinted me. I had a good moment with him, the feeling was good, he told me that he found me charming (he was sober) and he liked me. We went to his house, we chatted a lot in the car. I wore my pjs, same for him. We chilled and sat on the couch. We were about to watch a movie on netflix but he started to kiss me. After I drank (alcohol, I never drink alcohol in general but I wanted to this night to be more extroverted), him as well (but I was much more drunk than him, I even wanted to vomit later). I was quite in the defensive at first because I planned to be more serious and not having sex so fast. Since I was drunk, I told that I am not really confortable with my body and it could impact my sexual experiences. He was really flirty, slowly touching me, he couldn't stop compliment me (that he liked my body, that he found me attractive, that I am beautiful, that I have a nice smile....). I was getting more horny, so I slept with him (I didn't regret this time). He drived me at my uni next morning. When we left, he told me that we could meet another time if I wanted to. He texted me the same day later to ask how I was. We talked the next week (it led to sexting). I wasn't feeling it that much, so I didn't try to talk him, he didn't send me anything neither. Last time we talked was a week ago. I was really busy btw and too tired. But for whatever reasons I dreamed of him twice since then. He didn't block me and same for me.\n\nFrom what I explained, those expriences happened because I am probably much uglier irl or too different of my pictures? I admit that I posted selfies with a filter on on all of these experiences. Did those guys find me attractive or they were liars?\n\nOther people (other than guys met on app), told me that I am pretty. But I don't believe it, and I've red experiences of guys who've been catfished because they didn't find the girl attractive irl. But could these guys still wanted to physical touches with those girls?", "title": "Am I a catfish?

We had a short interview last week so she had a bit of context of my situation. So today she asked me some questions, and basically, in the first 15 minutes she came up with if I was comfortable taking anti-depressants, I said not at all, she kept insisting and explaining why they would be beneficial for me, she explained that I have been carrying this depression since I was a kid (I've already known that) and that had an impact in the development of my brain so they would help my brain to work better... then at the end of the session, she asked me again. \n\nI don't know, I just don't feel comfortable that within the first session we need to recur to this resort, personally, I view it as a last resort if talking doesn't work, but at the same time even knowing that could be beneficial and help me, I don't like the second effects I read about at all. I don't know what weights more for me in the balance. I thought this first session would help me on something but the only thing she did was recommend me to take meds and to try to do 3 activities per day to not just be laying on the bed which I was already trying to do without her help. \n\nIs it normal? I thought it would take some more sessions for somebody to introduce meds, I don't feel she knows me that much for it, but maybe I'm just overly paranoid and it's normal that when a therapist identifies severe depression in someone they would immediately offer this.

About life, death, our pasts, shit were trying to work on, theories on why things are the way they are, just intellectual shit. After the first week or so of constant texting, she started to distance herself more. I would message her throughout the day and she would just read it and not respond. I ended up confronting her about it and she tried to downplay it and sort of turned it on me; saying it\u2019s only been 2 weeks and she doesn\u2019t see the point in texting and would rather talk in person or over the phone. We just recently ended things because she said she needed to work on loving herself and wasn\u2019t capable of giving me what I need. \n\nI feel she used me to get unique insights on life and to almost have a sort of therapist she could date. Towards the end she told me she doesn\u2019t like me as much as I like her and that she was intimidated by how reserved I am for her and how nobody has ever treated her like that before.

You didn\u2019t choose what bad things happened to you. And for the mistakes you did make, you were still doing the best you could at the time. And if a relationship or a job or a parent burned you horribly in the past, it\u2019s normal and justified to still be afraid of fire. Your past is not your fault, but it is a part of who you are. And believe it or not, many people who went through similar things are not doing as well as you are.\n\nWe should all try to improve, for no other reason than it will make our life better tomorrow. **But we have to have realistic expectations**. We can\u2019t lash out at ourselves because we still feel so broken. We can\u2019t hate ourselves because the pain is still here, and we can\u2019t resent all the thorns along the path that covered us in these scars. Resenting the past won\u2019t make it go away.\n\nI\u2019m learning to handle these low spots better when they pop up, and that\u2019s good because they don\u2019t seem to ever stop. Sometimes that old pain comes rushing back and all you can do is remind yourself that the past did happen and it\u2019s okay to still hurt sometimes. Of course it is not fair that those things happened to us. But your best life is not reached by constantly resenting things you can\u2019t change.\n\nSometimes self care means \u201cI can\u2019t change that bad stuff that happened to me, but trying to cut these old scars out is only making things worse.\u201d\n\nYou can focus on doing things you enjoy and being around people you like. Let\u2019s try to get the most out of the life we have, not waste time wishing it was different. I\u2019ve been through a lot but cutting out old scars never made things better. Please have some compassion for yourself. You\u2019ve been through a lot too.\n\n**Further Reading:** If this post resonated with you then I highly recommend Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach. That book was instrumental in me learning to become aware of my emotions through mindfulness, accept them without fighting them, and then live life instead of resenting it. You can\u2019t get where you want to go just by hating where you are. And really powerful change starts with being honest about where you are, scars and all.", "title": "I think sometimes you forget how much you've been through"}, {"created_utc": 1635593351, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qizlcg/how_to_heal_yourself_from_selfsabotage_and/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "I traumatized myself and used my break-up as an excuse to over-indulge.

Heck, I recently completed my undergrad in Computer Science(CS) with a first class - distinction. But, I would say that it is very easy to do this in my country. I feel like I did all this because of the competition around me. But, now I feel directionless. I got a job at an IT Company after my bachelors but ghosted it because of the mentally taxing mundane work there. Since around four months I have been unemployed and diagnosed with OCD(the fear of catching the respiratory virus is getting worse each day even though everything is getting back to normal), anxiety and mild depression.\n\nFrom a very young age, I wanted to go to USA for masters(MS) in Computer Science because that is what family members who I am close with did but now, I am not so sure. I feel like I do all this hard work and end up working for some company with a decent life whereas the owners of these companies grow richer everyday and enjoy life to the fullest because of the work I do for them.\n\nIt is worth noticing that, I am may/ may not be(I don't know myself) interested in Computer Science and I chose it just because of the money and I wanted to go to USA because of the better quality of life(than my country). Recently, I felt like Environment Science or something related would be easier than CS and wanted to do MS in that in USA. But, I don't know the kind of problems I would face as an international student changing my major completely with not an ounce of knowledge in it, the job situation then and so on.\n\nTo get a job in tech, I have to learn something called DSA(Data Structures and Algorithms) and it is so fucking hard. To move to USA or other countries for that matter, I have to write two tests - GRE and TOEFL. I know that I have to prepare for DSA, GRE and TOEFL but I wake up everyday, watch YouTube and Netflix, masturbate, eat and sleep. I don't know why I don't want to do anything in life.\n\nI have 100% confidence that, I can manage to get into a MS in Computer Science program in USA because I have seen even the dumbest people do this. But, I fear that I may fail after going there and fall into huge debts(money and time lost) and should come back to my country. I would be fucked for life if this happens.\n\nOn the other hand, even though my country is a good place for tech jobs, I am finding it very very difficult to find decent jobs.

He has a very high paying job and also makes money from investments so I knew we were okay financially. I completely trusted him. He said he thought of us as a team, he felt like we were already married. \n\nAnd then two days ago, completely out of the blue, he said he wanted to break up. He said he\u2019d been having doubts for awhile, he said that I give up too easily, that I\u2019m too full of self hate, and that I wouldn\u2019t be a good parent. He also didn\u2019t like that I didn\u2019t want our kids to just have his last name, I wanted to hyphenate because my last name is very important to me for family reasons. I was just completely blind sided. I\u2019m in therapy and I honestly felt like I had been making improvements. I had a job interview set up for this week. We had talked about the name thing so long ago and I thought we had reached an agreement we were both happy with. I was devoted to being the best partner to him. He left yesterday morning to move back with his parents in another state. He won\u2019t answer my texts or phone calls. \n\nI\u2019m just completely devastated. I can\u2019t eat or sleep. Every breath hurts. He was my whole world, we were planning our future together. We were always talking about marriage and kids. He never, ever, ever expressed any issues with our relationship. He never gave me a chance to discuss these things. He was only ever loving and supportive and kind, but now he\u2019s acting cold and cruel and cowardly. I might never see him again. \n\nI just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to move on. I still love him, I genuinely thought of him as my soulmate. He was my whole world and my whole future. I\u2019m in so much pain, I couldn\u2019t drive to my relative to take her to her chemo treatments this week because I was scared of what I might do if I was alone in a car for several hours. I know I have to live through this but it seems impossible. I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll never love again. \n\nIf you read this, thank you. I just need to get it out I think. If you have any advice I\u2019d love to hear it\n\nEdit: Thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone who has commented. I\u2019m so moved by the kindness of strangers. I actually feel better than I did when I first posted this. I\u2019ve eaten a little and I can breathe without it hurting. It\u2019ll take time to heal but I\u2019m on my way.

Can we start with that premise? And if your life is great right now then go climb a mountain or bang your hot spouse or something, this post is not for you.\n\nThis post is to ground some people feeling hopeless like myself. It\u2019s easy to look at present troubles and project them onto the entirety of the future. I do this a lot and honestly it\u2019s pretty damaging. But there\u2019s a counterbalance exercise that keeps me sane: taking stock of what present things you\u2019ll miss later. So what does that mean?\n\n**Example 1: Dealing with loneliness**\n\nI am pretty lonely right now. I\u2019m single, I don\u2019t go on dates, and there\u2019s a lot of times that I wish I had someone to hold or talk to or lean on. It\u2019s hard.\n\nBut I also have some friends that are married with kids. They have different problems. They are not lonely, they actually wish they were alone more. I\u2019m not saying their problems are better, but there will probably come a time where I will miss *part* of the life I have now. Not all of it, but I\u2019ll miss all the free time and autonomy that the single life contains.\n\n**Example 2: Uncertainty early in your career**\n\nI\u2019m also in my 20\u2019s. As such, I don\u2019t know where my career will go, where I\u2019ll live, or many other things about my future. I have anxiety because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing what I should be doing, and while I do have options it\u2019s uncomfortable to never know if you\u2019re doing the right thing.\n\nOld people are in a different situation. There isn\u2019t much uncertainty. They\u2019re in pain most of the time, they know their best years are behind them, and they see the future with too much certainty - sadly they don\u2019t have much future left. When I\u2019m that age I\u2019ll probably miss the abundance of time I have now (hopefully), even if it comes with some uncertainty.\n\n**Don\u2019t glamorize the future just because you haven\u2019t seen its problems yet**\n\nI\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t have terrible problems today. I am just saying you\u2019ll have different problems later. With humans the grass is always greener on the other side. We\u2019re never 100% content. You\u2019ll lose some of the benefits you enjoy now, and you\u2019ll gain some problems that are now unknown to you. Don\u2019t believe me? Look a few years back when you were pining for something you have now, and you thought it would complete you. How did that work out?\n\nCan you use that as a counterbalance? Can you forecast into your future and imagine what you\u2019ll miss about where you are now? Maybe you have youth or free time. Maybe you have access to still living grandparents. Maybe you have joints that let you hike for hours. But today is only here for a little while.\n\n**Embrace today while it\u2019s here**\n\nRolling around in self pity for today\u2019s problems doesn\u2019t fix them. And someday I'll be super pissed that I squandered all my free time in embracing negative emotions. I\u2019ll be chasing crying babies, wishing I had time to mow the lawn and do my taxes and I'll think \u201cWhy didn't I just play video games and be selfish when I was 25 instead of feeling miserable and hating that I had all of this free time?!\u201d Do you hate your commute? There\u2019s a lot of overwhelmed parents who would trade an arm and a leg for 30 minutes of solitude and silence every day.\n\nI'm not trying to tell you what to do, but I know for myself I feel an obligation to enjoy this time just so that I don't regret it as much later. I'll have other problems in the future. And that's okay, but I want to regret my current decisions as little as possible when I get there. Your life is up to you. But please try to make decisions who won't piss you off when you look back and no longer have the things you're taking for granted now.\n\n**Further Reading:** If this post resonated with you, I highly recommend *101 Essays To Change The Way You Think* by Brianna Wiest.

I'm a 20 y/o woman, facing a dilemma that I wanted advice on but feel too embarrassed to talk to anybody about as they might judge me. For starters, I suffer from anxiety and depression. I rarely go out because I'm so disgusted with all of the weight I've gained since the penny era. With all of that said, I met this really amazing guy online (I never planned on liking him or talking to him) We've been talking otp and texting for 7 months and facetimed once. I've built this incredible connection with him like I didn't know was possible. Problem is, we've never met irl... and he literally lives a couple of minutes away. *\\*This post was from a few months ago, I'm adding on to this and we are now NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS in the same apartment complex, I didn't plan this and never wanted this to happen. Actually, my worst nightmare, and I'll tell you why.\\**\n\nI kept making excuses for not seeing him before because I am feeling terribly insecure about my appearance right now and I'm basically a hermit, I barely go out to have fun, and being a full-time student at a university (that I mostly attend online) is my only current occupation. But y'all, he's the sweetest and most understanding man I've ever talked to and he's interested in *me*. The emotional bond I have with him is so beautiful, we've cried together at 4 am as he unpacked his hurts like him being SA'd- something he's never told, anybody. I'm so honored for him to have trusted me like that, I liked him even more getting to know him. He's a healthy communicator and taught me how to be one. Nobody's ever liked me like and he finds me rare and special. I didn't know guys like him existed. \\**We don't talk anymore but still have each other on some social medias\\**\n\nHe's tall and very handsome, he is nearly identical to Mark Sloan from Grey's Anatomy (i don't make his head big lol) and he's pretty popular locally where I live, I live in a pretty small town. I thought he'd be a cocky/player pretty boy but he's actually quite literally the opposite. I'm not into social media that much like he is which is why he's interested in me, I think. I'm also insecure because of all these girls that throw themselves at him constantly in his comments and irl. We don't talk anymore and it's my fault for being insecure (I didn't tell him about my mental health) and also it's totally my fault for never taking things to the next level aka going out. \\**And now, I just moved into this new building with my family and found out he's my next-door neighbor! I suspected that it could've been the same building (from his social media posts) and by the time I found out, (my sisters and mom spied) it was too late! we have already signed the lease and let go of our old place. We couldn't go back, no matter how much I wanted to. I'm so terrified now and my anxiety is even worse now than ever before. I literally don't know what to do because I wanted to take things further prior to this discovery but ON MY OWN TERMS. and now? I'm like ahh he can't see me!\\**\n\nI'm scared I'm missing out on a really great guy though and am not living up to my own potential. Literally, the whole reason why we didn't work out was because I didn't want to meet him even though he kept begging and pleading. I really hurt him everytime I said no as he's told me. He once wrote me a long paragraph about how he's hurt two months into us talking saying: \"seeing me shouldn't be a hassle seeing as we're neighbors\" Now, We're literally NEIGHBORS! talk about speaking this into existence. but the thing is, I never manifested this and Idk what this means:/ This whole situation is bananas.

I consider myself to be a rather impulsive person. I  would like to be more measured and controlled. Its not that I don't  understand it, its that I fail to exercise it. I need some practical  advice on how I can go forward with this.\n\nI  have no problem with this part of me when it comes to things like  shopping or other trivial things. There are two sides, either I will  keep procrastinating and take a long time to do something. Like say I am  buying shoes, I will probably look at several different brands and read  up on all of them and their different features or I will walk into a  store, listen to a salesman and go ahead and purchase the very first  pair I like. I don't think this is supposed to be normal but then I am  not exactly objective about myself either so I will appreciate some  perspective. To give you a few examples, selecting a restaurant for a  meal, buying clothes, gadgets etc. I sometimes behave erratically like I  said and although I don't like it I don't give it much thought since  these are things that just not affect me that much end of the day.\n\nBut  this causes issues with people. A hundred thoughts cross my mind when I  am talking to someone. I am sure that is the case with everyone. But I  am sometimes amazed at how people leave out obvious reactions in some  situations, later only to realize that it was a smart thing to do and  they were being sensible adults.\n\nSometimes  even in a professional setting, I would blurt out things that are not  really \"politically correct\" and at times it is appreciated as being  straightforward but I know it can just as easily backfire. I just cant  seem to tell myself to shut up in the moment.\n\nMore  importantly, it hurts me with personal interaction with people.  Coworkers in personal capacity, friends, sometimes even family members.  It is not that I don't care for them, I do. But I question that if I do  end up saying inconsiderate things, is my concern for them just a show?  Is this a reasonable line of thinking? There are multiple things here.  Lets say a family member was in trouble, and I was in a situation to  help, I would. But if that member was close enough, I would blurt out at  some point how they got themselves into this mess. If the person is not  very close, I find it easier to shut up and move on. So, pointing out  (when I do), maybe right but I do it in wrong setting only to regret it  later.\n\nAlso I have an issue  controlling my thoughts over inappropriate things about female friends  (Not always, but I would rather it never happened in the first place).  At times for example I am talking to someone and I am distracted by  something, maybe their clothing (NOT implying that it is inappropriate  clothing in anyway) or certain movements as little as maybe flicking  their hair. It shouldn't trigger an unnatural thought but it does and I  would mostly control it, let the moment pass and carry on with the  conversation. Few times I have made remarks and some very good friends  have laughed about it and let it pass. But I understand immediately it  was not appropriate. Problem is, its after the fact. I shouldn't put  them in that position. What do I do about it in the moment?\n\nI sincerely appreciate all advice.", "title": "Help me become better"}, {"created_utc": 1638861363, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/rateev/i_am_going_to_give_up_smartphone_and_gadgets_for/", "num_comments": 23, "score": 1, "selftext": "I(17F) once jokingly asked a gadget addicted friend to go on a smartphone detox.

I'm interested in fostering and adopting some years from now, but for the forseeable future I intend to be child free and I do not intend to bear a child myself. I do not have experience with kids in any way, and when I'm around kids, I never know what to do or say or what is appropriate so I tend to just ignore them. I really want to be there for my mom friends and have a relationship with them and their kids but it feels like I am unable to connect with them once they have a kid - and I have no idea how to foster a relationship with a kid at all, though I'd like to. I know that some of my inability to maintain a friendship after they become parents is on me so I'll give a few examples.\n\nThroughout my teen years and a little bit as a young adult I have been vehemently against having a kid (myself) and I have vocalized that. In the early years I would also vocalize that I thought that many people were selfish for *choosing* to have kids when they can't afford them. Although I have reflected and grown since then and do not fully agree with my former beliefs, I'd never vocalized it and it has led to some regrettable situations where my friends would hide that they were pregnant from me. \n\nThe first time this happened was in high school and since she hid being pregnant from everyone, I never reflected on my own actions. At this point I can see how my adamant anti-kid stance would prevent her from feeling able to open up to me. I don't blame her in any way for not telling me and honestly I don't know if she would have said anything if I hadn't vocalized those thoughts, but regardless I wish I hadn't. The second time was recently, with a friend I was really close to. I had already done some reflecting about my stance on kids and we had had conversations in the past where we agreed that we didn't want kids. When she got pregnant, she realised she did want to keep it but she was afraid to tell me because she thought that since I did not want a kid, I was anti-kid, and when she had a miscarriage she also did not feel she could confide in me. She never let on that there was anything going on with her so this led to miscommunication, and in the end I thought we had just drifted apart as friends when it turned out that it was my fault that we had drifted apart, and I hadn't made her feel comfortable enough to lean on me for support during that time. I feel so terrible about it all, and I really don't ever want this to happen again. I will never again talk about kids nor parents to prevent this, but the problem now is, I have no idea how to be a good friend to my parent friends - who presumably will eventually be all or most of my friends as time goes. \n\nI have a couple friends who had a surprise kid about two years ago. They really stepped up to the plate and are the most amazing parents a kid could ever ask for. We would hang out every other day before they had their kid, and once she was born we stopped hanging out except for once a month or two. I expected this to happen, but then covid hit and we stopped hanging out altogether for a year. Now she is two, and we are starting to hang out again but I really have no idea how to be there and support them in the right way. They only seem to hit us up when they have a babysitter and I don't want her to feel like we won't hang out with them with the kid there. I want to ask her directly but she does not answer her phone and I don't want to spend the little time we do hang asking her to tell me how I can be a better friend. \n\nI just made some new friends who are new parents to a two month old. I am doing better it feels like as we hang frequently, about once a week. However I am SO awkward with the baby - I am afraid to hold her and I also don't want to smother her like people tend to do with babies, especially since we aren't close friends right now. But, I feel as though this comes off like I don't want anything to do with the baby, and I do. I just have no experience with babies and do not want to tell her I'm more than happy to watch the baby considering I don't know anything about feeding, changing diapers, or calming her. I really want to, I just don't feel like it's my place with a newer friendship and no experience. \n\nSo, I am at a loss. I really have no idea how to be a good friend as a child free person and I would like to change that. If anyone has any advice or knows a better place to ask this I really would love to hear it.

The \u201cmasculine traits\u201d I refer to in the title are what comes to mind because of traditional stereotypes, and is simply an easy way of describing what I\u2019m talking about. \n\n\n\nAnyway, now that I got that out of the way let me begin. \n\n\n\nI am 21 years old. I am struggling to figure out who I am, who I want to be, *how* I want to be. There are a plethora of things about myself I want to improve, but I\u2019ll start with some background first:\n\n\n\nMy father was an asshole. He was angry all the time and emotionally unavailable. He treats my mom terribly. All of this rubbed off on me and I\u2019m still working on not acting like this. \n\n\n\nHe also never taught me how to work on a car or fix things around the house, because he doesn\u2019t know how to do these things himself. I suppose I can\u2019t blame him if he truly doesn\u2019t know how, but I just wish I had someone to teach me these things. \n\n\nSo, I never had a great \u201cfather figure\u201d type person in my life, and I still don\u2019t. All my managers are women, most of my coworkers are as well. \n\n\nAnother thing doesn\u2019t help me trying to be \u201cmanly\u201d  is that I am on the shorter side and I am fat. I\u2019m not one of those people to bitch about height, but short+fat+my anger (which i\u2019m working on) does feed into a certain stereotype. \n\n\nI feel like people tend to view me as a loser. I, of course, have no hard evidence of this but I have several behaviors of mine that I\u2019m trying to work on that I think contribute to this. I don\u2019t believe in the whole \u201calpha male/beta male\u201d bullshit but if someone had to describe me as one or the other I would definitely be  a \u201cbeta male\u201d. \n\nOkay, enough blabber, here are my main issues: \n\n**Anger** \n* Like mentioned above, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s genetic or if I just learned this from my father. I get mad over small things, dumb things, things that don\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t tend to get mad at specific people(usually), just frustrated in general.  When it happens it\u2019s like a toddler throwing a tantrum and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how it comes across to everyone as well. \n\n\n**Speaking** \n* I talk too quickly, and unclearly. I don\u2019t know how to describe my voice without a recording, and I\u2019m trying to remain anonymous so i\u2019ll do the best i can. I had years of speech therapy growing my up and while I technically pronounce everything correctly, something just sounds \u201coff\u201d  still when I speak. I also have no \u201cflow\u201d, it always sounds like I don\u2019t know what my next word is going to be. In addition to speaking quickly and my (IMO) weird enunciation, I feel like even if I am confident I don\u2019t *sound* confident. In the moment I always end up sounding unsure of myself, even if i\u2019m not. \n\n**Appearance**\n* I am overweight, as mentioned above. I have manboobs, and they look terrible in proportion to the rest of the fat on me which happens to be distributed pretty evenly. I don\u2019t know why my fat pooled in my chest the way it did, but it prevents me from standing or sitting in positions i\u2019d like to. For example,  I never wear plain t-shirts, i always have something on top (sweater, polo, etc). Even with that they\u2019re still visible so I always cross my arms, or slouch so that they don\u2019t protrude. I never stand or sit in confident positions like I\u2019d like to do because it makes my manboobs very obvious. This also stops be from wearing clothes I\u2019d like to wear. I know that \u201cno one cares\u201d \u201cno one would judge you\u201d etc but first of all, that\u2019s just not true. Maybe no one would *say* anything but people would notice and judge. \n* Secondly, even if it was true and no one judged me, it still mentally affects me to the point where I don\u2019t personally feel comfortable wearing the clothes I want or standing the way I like knowing I have manboobs. I know losing weight would reduce this so I am actively doing that. \n* Like I mentioned above, height also comes into play for me. I\u2019ll repeat that I accept my height and find nothing wrong with it. It\u2019s never affected my dating life or anything else, BUT there\u2019s no denying that height does factor into play every now and then. For instance, a tall man who doesn\u2019t talk much may be seen as stoic where as a short guy who does the same may just be called \u201cshy\u201d. Not a very good example but you get the gist of what I mean. Obviously there\u2019s nothing I can do about my height so I don\u2019t even really know why I included it into this post. I am going to work on things I *can* control like weight, personality, personal hygiene, etc. \n\n\n**Personality/Socializing**\n* This is probably one of the most important ones for me. I have a boring personality. Additionally, I love socializing but I am very bad at it. One example is with friendly banter. Most men will joke around and make fun of each other while playing games or hanging out. I never learned how to do that , and when it happens I can never think of a witty comeback and the whole situation either gets awkward or I just take the \u201cinsult\u201d and seem like a loser who doesn\u2019t have anything to say back. Obviously these are friends and we\u2019re just joking around, don\u2019t read into this too much. Im basically just saying I can\u2019t think of witty comebacks. Secondly, conversations in general. I\u2019m bad at holding a conversation unless I already know the person, and even then it\u2019s still hard. I know people like taking about themselves so I try to ask them questions about themselves and all that jazz, but I still come across as super awkward. This goes hand in hand with my point about talking where I just  always come across as unsure, and if I try to sound confident it comes across as me being an asshole. \n\n\n**Cowardice**\n* I am a coward. I think this may be because of anxiety or something because it\u2019s very weird. I can\u2019t do anything alone. If i\u2019m home by myself and need to go outside, I get paranoid out that something is out in the woods. I could never go camping or hiking by myself, but when I\u2019m with even one other person all my fears are gone. I don\u2019t know where this comes from but i\u2019d really like to be able to live without fear every time I\u2019m doing something on my own. (And let me add that it\u2019s the presence of someone in general that make the fear go away-not a specific person/people. Let\u2019s say i\u2019m walking on a trail alone at night. If there is one person half a mile behind me I will feel safe but if I\u2019m the only one on the trail I get paranoid out of my mind)\n\n\n\nHere is some common advice I hear/have read so that people don\u2019t repeat it: \n* Speak through your diaphragm. First of all, your diaphragm is for inhaling, it\u2019s impossible to speak with it. I understand the point of this advice though and I try to do it as much as possible. \n* Please don\u2019t send me any videos/articles/etc from those cringey youtubers who\u2019s advice on how to be a man basically just boils down into being an asshole to everyone. \n* Work out. Working out can increase testosterone, make you feel better, give you more confidence, etc. It\u2019s a positive feedback loop; and yes I am working on it.\n* About the manboobs: Gyno-something.  For those who don\u2019t know, this is when males have actual breast tissue causing manboobs. It\u2019s pretty common, I think 1/5 males have it. About gyno I just want to say that my manboobs have definitely grown as I gained weight and they used to not be nearly this bad. So I feel like at least 90% of it is fat, and at the weight I am now it\u2019s impossible to feel of the rest is tissue or just more fat. \n* Last little tangent before I end: I know that \u201cif you have a penis you\u2019re a real man\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re manly the way you are\u201d comments are coming. I get the sentiment, but that\u2019s really not what I need to hear. You know what I\u2019m trying to say, lol.

I just hate these traits about me and want to improve upon them for my own mental and physical health. I realize Reddit can\u2019t give me all of these answers and also isn\u2019t a replacement for therapy which I intend to go to. I like Reddit because I can get a variety of opinions and consolidate all the advice into one plan for improving myself. \n\nSo now that my huge tangent is over, I\u2019d like to thank those of you that will read all of this and take the time to respond. I will end this by asking a few questions that you can hopefully give me some answers to now that you\u2019ve read a little bit about  me: \n\n1. How can I be more \u201cmanly\u201d? Not asshole \u201cmanly\u201d. I want to be sociable, not afraid, confident, etc manly.  \n2. What is some advice for improving my speaking voice? Don\u2019t give me the breathing crap because I already do that. I feel mostly like my tone and way of speaking is what\u2019s wrong, not my physical voice itself \n3.

I\u2019m just struggling with life. I know that\u2019s normal at my age, and such but I haven\u2019t the slightest clue how to make it better or where to start. It\u2019s hard enough to do things with an autoimmune disease but I have the functionality of a child. But because I\u2019m 20 it\u2019s just expected that everything wrong with me will go away. Even my chronic disease. \n\nMy parents are of no help. They just forbid me from doing anything including things that would\u2019ve been good for my development. I actually live with my grand aunt and uncle (my caregivers) in Jamaica now, as they\u2019re the only one who actually gaf about me and I\u2019m making the most progress I have in years but of course my mom now wants me to go back to Canada just to fuck it all up again. Thankfully I\u2019ve been able to delay it for awhile and I know he means well but every time my grand uncle \u201creminds\u201d me that I have \u201cso much potential\u201d and \u201cshould be out there on the real world\u201d I just die. I die inside. We have this uplifting and great speech about my future the night before and then the next day I\u2019m in bed crying and starving all day. I realized those words are the cause of my recent relapses of suicidal thinking but more so that they frighten me cuz I\u2019m terrified of my mom. There\u2019s no other way to put it.\n\nFrom she\u2019s been asking me to come back I\u2019ve just been trying to avoid it cuz when I think about it I panic, then try to find a way out of staying with her, to find out it can\u2019t work again and resume panicking. My dad isn\u2019t any better but at least he fucks off unless I talk to him or ask him for money. And he doesn\u2019t believe in depression but he tries his best to cheer me up when I\u2019m sad and he remembers my quirks and triggers enough to even remind others. My mom is just a fucking tyrant. \n\nI love being out here in Jamaica but I have no adult skills to truly enjoy my freedom. I need a job to have money to go out to places but most importantly I need to know how to get to my destination. For the most part my friends are too busy for me but they are in work/school/both. It\u2019s also an extreme important factor that by being in Jamaica, I\u2019m with my caregivers who are actual good parents. They allow me freedom regardless of my age, they engage with me, respect my privacy, mental health and myself. And they care that I do well overall. They\u2019re looking out for my physical health, mental health and even general well-being. They just want me to do good no matter how difficult I\u2019m being.\n\nBut in Canada while my mom is there and I\u2019d rather be homeless than deal with that awful woman\u2026 Canada has three great things Jamaica could never have: an ample amount of available healthcare services, the warmth, kindness and safety needed for social anxious people like me to feel more comfortable in stepping out their shell (customer service and nice people are so rare in Jamaica they don\u2019t even exist\u2026 because they aren\u2019t Jamaican raised, they just so happen to live here) and most importantly opportunities; everywhere. I claim I want to do better with my life and free myself from the shackles of my ever-hateful family (also I need more medication) but I can only do that with the tools Canada offers\u2026 sadly indeed. \n\nNot be to a negative Nancy but I can see myself being forced to return home, with my mother, losing all progress I\u2019ve made, being forced into university, barely passing my classes to graduate and then being unable to get a job do to another mental breakdown and rotting away at home for a few years until someone lets me come back to Jamaica again.

I have three people willing to take me in for however long, but I feel so tired from the abuse that ironically and stupidly enough, my mind hates the theoretical stress I\u2019d have to go through moving somewhere else. \n\nIt\u2019s like I KNOW what I should be doing, improving myself, reaching out socially, distancing myself from my abuser both emotionally and physically, but my abuser has drained my spirit to the point that I\u2019m too tired to do what I know what\u2019s best for me. Almost as if they had successfully broken me.\n\nBut - I know I have to fight back. The idea of relearning what it\u2019s like to live, to find freedom, support from friends, and just\u2026 being free to be a kid again ignites something within me. To become a new person, not this whittled down and beaten up version of myself. To experience the things that truly make up a free person\u2019s life, to experience things in full color and to just\u2026 live. \n\nTo be able to find people I can be emotionally vulnerable with, to go out alone for a walk and to not dread coming home, to be able to enjoy the little things with a sense of freedom and peace. All I ever wanted was to be at peace.\n\nSo I guess what I\u2019m trying to ask is, where do I start on regaining the strength to pursue this freedom? From my physical health to my emotional state, my depression has trampled on it all. My life has been on pause and just generally stagnant for a long time, how do I create a new life for myself in this state, with admittedly low energy reserves? My end goal is to be studying abroad and creating a new life for myself, but I\u2019m aware I need to start small and prioritize what I\u2019ve left unchecked - the now. \n\nThe family situation is just a tad bit complicated, but there are no issues regarding me living somewhere temporarily, then when I turn 18 I can pretty much go anywhere. Money is not really the issue here.\n\nAs for my current state, I\u2019m not eating enough since my depression reduces my appetite greatly. Currently dehydrated but can\u2019t find the energy to grab a water. It\u2019s 3PM and I haven\u2019t eaten a bite or even had a sip of any sort of liquid. I have no hobbies besides writing and a language I\u2019m learning, and my schoolwork is behind but pretty flexible as it\u2019s based on my own motivation. I want to form social connections but have a hard time meeting people (pandemic) or even trusting them. I only have a few close friends, one of which I hang out with in real life near regularly. \n\nI have a place I could try staying in for a few weeks to get myself together, but I have this reoccurring fear that once I get back home my efforts will be for nothing, and I\u2019ll be reduced to this state again. I need to form a sort of schedule where I can be away from here on a regular, constant basis, but I haven\u2019t found the energy to even plan that.\n\nI want to work on myself but I believe I don\u2019t have enough knowledge or enough perspective to tackle this. I am aware dramatic changes need to happen given my circumstances, and that this will be a painful process. \n\nIf anyone has any advice or wise words to share, I would really appreciate it. I feel like I have a sort of hunch on where to start, but it\u2019s more like I dislike going into things unprepared. I really want to hear from people on what they think I should do, what to avoid, maybe even advice regarding emotional abuse and how to cope. I guess it\u2019s my form of filling the chamber before I head out to war, or some other poorly made metaphor. \n\nThank you so much for anyone who took the time to read this and/or reply. I feel like I\u2019m at the bottom but I will not give up yet.

I moved to a new state with my parents 5 years ago, when I was 19. Since then, I've been working various part time and full time jobs whilst going to school (I've literally been going to school since I was 17 and still haven't gotten my bachelor's). In that whole time, my life has just been a whirlwind of wasting time and thinking \"what the fuck am I doing?\" I've only made one single friend since I moved, which is my girlfriend (been together 4 years now). I still live with my parents, and there's no way I can manage to keep taking classes and pay for an apartment. For the past 5 years I've spent probably 90% of my time in my room alone in front of my computer or my phone, sometimes just staring at the screen whilst trying to think of something I actually *want* to do. \n\nI've been a totally different person since the move. Much less talkative and social, I don't laugh or smile much. I spend time with my girlfriend, but I just have no fucking idea what I'm doing or who I am most of the time. I just feel totally and utterly lost and purposeless and I can't escape this feeling. It keeps me up most nights (takes me at least 2 hours to fall asleep). I feel like 99% of the time I'm not my true self, just a zombie on autopilot. I think this is really the heart of the issue. It's like there's a wall in my brain that prevents me from truly being myself or reaching my true potential, always. The only time I get a glimpse of myself is when I'm drunk or when I go back to visit my old friends in California. I feel like I don't belong in this world anymore. I need to feel the emotions of life again, I need to be somewhere I feel like I belong, I need to know who the fuck I am. \n\nI should mention that I have pretty bad adhd, which has led to anxiety and recurrent depression. I finally saw a psychiatrist last week for the first time since I was a child and he prescribed me a low dose of Adderall (which I haven't started taking yet), he also said he might prescribe me an antidepressant (Zoloft I think) in a couple months. Maybe it'll help, but I find it hard to be hopeful anymore. I'm going to be losing my medical insurance in a month so there's that stress too. Idk, I just keep thinking to myself \"I'm 24, I'm still young and there's plenty of time to change, but I've been saying this the last 5 years. I have to act NOW.\" But I keep watching the years go by and feel like my youth is vanishing and there's nothing I can do about it, because I can never come up with any answer to what is actually wrong with me and what I actually want. And I hate knowing that I'm probably going to waste the rest of my 20s like this. So here I am, again, coming to reddit and hoping for some guidance, comfort, anything.

I just discovered this subreddit after searching for some interests/hobbies lists on google to pick it up. I decided to pour out my feelings here a bit to ask for help, to make progress and be better in a definite manner. I understand we all will still have bad days here and there, but I want the majority of my life to be good, or at least better than now. Sorry in advance for confusing sentences, since English is not my first language, and for the long ass bible I'm writing...\n\nI just sleep all day, spend awake all night. When I do try to stick with something, I'll do well for a couple of days. For example, in October I decided to start going to the gym, and I went for a week or so, until I missed one day due to muscle soreness (man, what a pain in the ass, quite literally). And then it became 2 missed days, 3 missed days... you get my point, I'm sure. And then I'll be in this slump, this time a little more behind than from where I was before. \n\nNow I understand motivation isn't the driving force god who'll make my life better instantly. If it was, I wouldn't be here, I suppose...\n\nI make my lists, I create my routines and target goals. All of them are very reasonable. I don't make a routine where I wake up at 6am to go jogging when currently I'm going to sleep at said time. I don't put a lot of different things on it, I try to make the bare minimum a habit, such as keeping my hygiene in check. It's embarrassing to think I can't bother to do it. It's always like, \"couple of days won't be so bad, huh?\" Each time, I'll put myself through it... make progress for a week or 2 even, and then it happens: a nap during the day, one more episode, one more day on Stardew Valley....\n\nCovid just makes it even worse. I'm at home all the time and even when I start to leave, these damn new variants just keep on coming. I do live in a small town too, so we don't have much to be doing around here either. It's just a boring life, where I'm like a cat, sleep and eat (and Reddit, so much Reddit), except the cat is happy and I'm just dreading.\n\nEven like going for a car ride with my dad (to train my driving skills and simply because it's quality time to us) has been getting to me. It makes him sad and in turns makes me sad, but I just can't bring myself to it. Other habits I had are slowly going away too or just being completely misplaced, since I sleep all day. Then it comes 3am and I want to breakdance my heart's content away in my room. Can't do that though, so it's one more thing to add to the pile.\n\nI'll keep vague in case, but recently I started an online business with my dad (they already owned a store, we just made it online). As the younger out of us two, I'm the tech savvy person (not really) and responsible for the website, and putting content on it and social media. It's drowning and dreadful. We haven't done any sales yet and that just adds to my stress, specially because I was the one who said it would be a good idea to make a website and we invested quite a bit to make sure everything was good to go. Because of it, I don't want to work on it anymore but I still hang on for him.  I can't quit and we can't put off the website, that would be bad. I want to make it right.\n\nI have many ideas. I have (sparse but it's here) knowledge. I want to do it. But as soon as I open the damn website, it's like... \"It's Friday, we have the weekend to do this\". My dad tries to help but he can't do much without me and it's just simpler to do it myself. \n\nI'm quite lonely too, couple of friends here and there but they all seem to be advancing in life or just generally doing better. To be honest, haven't read the subreddit much yet, but I will. I just felt that maybe putting out there my feelings would be a step towards bettering myself. But then again, I'm doing this at 2am so...\n\nLike I said, I'll read through the sub now, but will appreciate the comments in this post too. I have made up my mind, to be better, at any cost.

In this respect, everyone is like that, you, me and everyone who can still seem to be able to keep their life stable. Why am I saying that? Because it's a collective phenomenon, we've lost touch with each other. The successful people of this system also suffer from it, because there is no individual solution, there are only joint solutions. And the solution we are looking for is an honest exchange about our deepest feelings and sensations. Instead, we live more like work robots, in an imagined, merciless world of performance pressure, success, self-expression and competition.

Nevertheless, everyone can individually leave this sinking ship and go completely new ways and support others to do the same. This book is a guide not only to transforming your individual life but also to society as a whole. Based on our biology, fact is that we are all searching for the same. It is ultimately quite simple.

The most important thing you can learn from this book is that you can act, shape and change the world! Even if it might feel different at the moment.

This model doesn\u2018t work, we cannot get a therapist for every human being on this earth. This is not even possible for the richest countries. Our biology is already equipped with all that is necessary for helping and healing each other.

One of the reason she told me was : \"we needed to be happy with ourselves before making someone else happy\" and it brokes me. The first 3-4 days were stupidly hard, I was crying and calling my mom 4-5 times a day. I told myself I was absolutely nothing, everything in my life was atrocious, I didn't like the person I was becoming, I was depressed because I didn't have a good relation with family and friends, anxious because of the university and sad because of the breakup, overweight at 260 pounds and very much afraid of the future now that my life crumbled under my feet after loosing my girlfriend. I was hopeless. I felt alone (500 miles away from my family) cause I moved to live with my girlfriend. \n\nThen after 4 miserable day I decided put my life on the tracks after watching the documentary \"I'm not your guru with Tony Robbins\". As stupid as it is, I realized that I wanted the Breakup to be a Breakthrough. So I started to see a therapist and I wanted to change so I decided to fix myself 5 objectives to accomplish in the year :\n\n* Being 230 pounds (Loose 30 pound)\n* Read 5 books \n* Improve my second and third language\n* Get my Master Degree\n* And finally be good with myself\n\nSo it's been three month since I've wrote those objectives in my journal which I considered pretty much ambitious. Today, 3 months after my breakup I am 220 pounds, I've red 11 books all about self-developpement and about being a better person. I'm writing this text in english which is my second language. I've started talking with my family and friends because I put them aside cause of my depression and the stress that came with my ex-relationship. I make some new friends. I try to give the most possible love to the people who needs it and help others. So after only three month I can say that I actually feel good with myself. \n\nThe reason I'm saying all of this is not the show pride. I just want to encourage everyone who are living difficult events, living hard times to use those events to become a better person, to become the best version of yourself, your 2.0 you. Everything is possible when you see the world with a different eye, when you focus on what is good and what you really want.

It's hard because I've been called ugly by so many former peers in my life. I feel utterly doomed, like no one will ever want to talk to me or be friends with me. I've been alone all my life so far, besides family. I've never had a friend, relationship, etc. It stings badly. I don't think many on this earth know what it feels like to have no one to hang out with, no one to go out with, stuck at home 24/7 doing nothing. I don't even go to school with other people anymore, so I can't do that. Getting a job is also impossible right now as well. I have autism and severe anxiety/social anxiety, though I would consider myself both extroverted and introverted. I like to be around people until I don't, is what I'd describe it as. I am just afraid to talk to people, I am afraid they'll think I am a creep since I am ugly. \n\nI spent all of 2021 working on my happiness, and I feel the happiness I've ever been, besides my looks.

Due to my father sexually assaulting me from as early as I can remember up until he killed himself when I was 7 (he opted to kill himself rather than go to prison for sexually assaulting my cousin) I have a hard time believing in love, emotional intimacy and that someone cares enough about me to stick by my side. My older sister was blind with a brain tumor by the time I was born. She died when I was 5. It was rough growing up. Honestly trying to become an adult was harder. I had no money, direction, or love. My mother tried giving me away when I was a teenager. My youngest sister married the guy she met when she was 15. So a lot of unhealthy relationship dynamics during my first 20 years. Then I realized I was gay. \n\nI am attractive and well received. I am intelligent and quick witted. I am organized, resourceful, athletic, and a leader. I am also an alcoholic that has never admitted that to myself. It isn\u2019t a dependency issue as much as it ruins my decision making skills and causes me great grief. I punish myself with alcohol. \n\nRecognizing I needed a change, I spent some of the last of my money on health insurance, a 6 month DBT program, therapy, and have been taking 35-40 additional courses a month. These courses are about interpersonal skills, budgeting, the dos and don\u2019ts of communication, etc \n\nI am doing what I can to create my own outpatient rehab. For the most part, I have stopped drinking since September 30, 2021. \n\nI have had an on and off relationship with my partner since December 2020. We first met and dated in 2015. I believe she is a beautiful, kind and sensitive woman that also has her own demons she battles. I come from poverty, she comes from generational wealth. We are both the black sheep of our families and identify as cis lesbian women. She has been to rehab 3 times, I have been to jail 3 times. I have zero guidance and supervision, she has judgmental people in her ear telling her what to do and how to do it. We are a lot alike while being very different. We absolutely compliment one another and I consider her a blessing in my life. \n\nAll of this is to say, I thought she had my back. We were drugged Saturday night at a gay bar in West Hollywood. She remembers her guy friends leaving us at the bar. We took shots with new \u201cfriends\u201d. The last thing I remember was talking to Madison from Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles. I don\u2019t know what was the last thing she remembered. She woke up in the hospital around 6am in the hallway stuck to an IV. I woke up just before 11am on a futon style bed in an apartment in pain. I was anally r*ped and my body hurt.\n\nI find my car a few blocks away, crying and confused. My partner is leaving me hysterical voicemails about the night and expressing her concern for me. She didn\u2019t get any discharge paperwork from the hospital and I, too, bolted from where I was as soon as I came to. I did not have an IV stuck in me though. \n\nWe talk on Monday. I am disgusted with myself. \n\nShe told me I am on video at our hotel leaving in my car at 330am. She said I was there for 30 minutes. I have no recollection of any of this. We think we were given GHB. \n\nMy belongings are in my trunk. Some of her belongings are in my trunk. I did not know I had anything in my car. My backseat is covered with a seat protector and \u201chammock\u201d dog blanket 99% of the time. I also always have dog treats, toys, and a big jug of water in the backseat. Nothing was there. I wonder if I was assaulted in my car. My driver seat was pushed back pretty far. I am a 5\u20195 woman and couldn\u2019t touch my own pedals.\n\nI keep trying to ignore how I feel. The only person who has ever touched me anally is my dad. I have lied about being open to kinky stuff to keep my partner happy, but she\u2019s never tried any Butt stuff and said she doesn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t feel the need to. \n\nShe cried and I thought she cared about me and my experience as well. But she didn\u2019t. She just wanted her stuff. Which I never ever took issue with. But she called the police on ME and threatened me with a felony charge. I didn\u2019t do anything and was shocked at her behavior. I knew it was her friends. She even said they wouldn\u2019t let her do this or do that. I wanted her to keep my experience between us. It\u2019s incredibly personal and you can see why someone who lost control and was violated wanted control. I own a company and sent her an NDA. I sent her belongings to her via Uber. According to her friend she was asleep and couldn\u2019t sign it. To have her lie to me over and over was just too much. I say I\u2019ll cancel the Uber, knowing I had sent her all the info, plate number and shared the trip with her friend. She\u2019s happy. She gets her stuff and gets to go from crying, saying we can work things out together (this is all after her friend messaged me about her things being gone) and telling me she\u2019s going to k*ll herself to contacting my friends and threatening me with a felony. The whiplash still hurts. \n\nI have decided to do better because I wanted us to move together to Nevada. I wanted both of us to get serious with our mental health and relationship. To quit drinking for those 6 months and focus on what\u2019s important. To limit non-professional outside influence. I wanted to pay off my debt in those 6 months and align our goals to better our future. \n\nI wanted us to drive the west coast and Baja for surf spots. We both work remotely and we both appreciate a surf/van dwelling lifestyle. She is my adventure partner and I trust her with my life. I thought she always had my back. \n\nI am deciding to do better even if it\u2019s without her. I need emotional and financial support to accomplish my personal goals. I truly thought she would align with these goals. I am making a lot money in 2022 and expected us to create our 1 and 5 year plan. We even looked around a community we want to live in after the Nevada stint. The thing with Merritt, though, is she cannot commit to anything outside of work and friends. She gives up easily, whereas I am resilient and persistent. I wish I had her resources, probably like she wishes she had my moxie and idgaf attitude. I give effort and fail and she isolates and avoids. Again, we compliment one another, but that\u2019s only when she participates.\n\nI am deciding to do better without her, does anyone have any advice on my next steps? Are there any groups I can join that allow victims to work through the physical and emotional pain I am still experiencing? I would prefer it be anonymous-I have an immense amount of shame I have buried for 36 years. I cannot sleep and my life has been nothing short of a living nightmare since Saturday. I was on the right track and now I feel so derailed, I wonder if I will ever get back to getting better. \n\nThank you for reading and thank you to anyone offering advice or support.", "title": "I Am A Fighter That Needs Someone In My Corner"}, {"created_utc": 1642022215, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/s2h71b/starting_today_im_done_letting_my_family_and/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "I live in a small town and have been all my life. \n\nI moved in a handful of places close by but overall I'm not happy with where I am. \n\nI have the problem of sharing too much and letting others dictate what to do with my life.

Sounds easy and I thought so too at first, but let me tell you it was a big challenge every single day. You've no idea how unappreciative and judgmental the world around you is, and you are to yourself until you become grateful.

I have lately realized that it has messed up with my sexuality. I have an inner circle of friends whose constant care and love have made me navigate through my life so far. This is one of the few good things that I have in my life. I am just a high school graduate and this year, I decided to enroll myself in a bachelor\u2019s course which has helped me a lot mentally. I had this disdain over academic studies as I became so frustrated with the whole process in my high school. I was a good student and I think I messed up. I missed out on so many things because of that. Most of my friends are married now and everyone\u2019s starting this new journey in their life which makes me feel left out. I am nearing my 30s which kind of freaks me out. I don\u2019t have any savings as I also have to support my family which I want to change this year. I was having a shower today and I realized how my body has changed a lot in a few years of time. I mean, I didn\u2019t like myself at all and in this process, I didn\u2019t take care of my body which shows, right! I felt so affected by realizing that my face is already wrinkled, I have bald spots and grey hair, plus the belly fat and whatnot.

I am trying to gather myself by thinking that at least I took a step forward by enrolling in a Bachelor\u2019s course in a decade but that didn\u2019t help. I feel like I have messed up big time. I feel so pathetic in every family gathering. The kiddos in the school earn better by their Instagram\u2019s marketing and online shopping. I am not jealous but everything is taking a toll on me and I really want to do something. Yes, this year, I feel less suicidal but I\u2019m afraid I mightn\u2019t be able to protect myself for long. Why does everything have to be like a checklist? I want to love myself first, fall in love, and explore so many things that life has to offer but it feels like a dead end. As I am nearing my 30s, and with the failure tag in everything, I wonder who would even want to share their life with me! I can't see any purpose of my life. I feel like I am drowning.

The aim here is to account for almost all the important things in your life, then tackle them one by one.\n\nThese are categories I think should be applicable to **everyone**:\n\n* Hobbies\n* Wealth\n* Health\n* Social relationships\n* Emotional wellbeing\n\nThese are additional categories I included in my plan:\n\n* YouTube\n* Learning/Career\n\nThese are some other categories that might generally be applicable to people\n\n* School \n* Art\n* Community \n\nBut don't feel constrained by the options above if care a lot about soccer and want to put it as a category even though it could fit into hobbies that is fine, it is your plan and you should put whatever is most important to you.\n\n# Step 1: Create goals for each category\n\nFor each life category you will want to create **3-5 goal items**, now each goal item will follow a particular format. They will be a goal pair of **input + output** goals. \n\n&gt; Input goals will be the ones that are measurable and completely in your control.\n\n&gt; Output goals will be the thing that you actually want and should happen as a result of the input goal.\n\nExample from my \"*Social*\" category:\n\n* *Output: I want to maintain strong friendships*\n* *Input:  I will reply to all messages daily*\n\n# Step 2: Create habits for each category\n\nWithin each category you should create all the relevant habits you will need to achieve this goal. When making habit it is good to specify a frequency where possible. \n\nFor example in \"*Hobbies*\" I had the following habits (I also decided to group them for convenience):\n\n* *Media*\n\t* *1 movie from list twice per month*\n\t* *Spend 30 minutes on new music twice per month*\n\n* *Lego*\n\t* *Spend 1 hour per week on Lego*\n\t* *Spend 30 mins once per month buying Lego*\n\n* *Piano*\n\t* *Spend 1 hour twice per month on Piano*\n\t\n# Step 3: Create mindsets for each category\n\nI found it useful to create some mindsets for each category that will help remind me of its importance to motivate me, and give me useful ways of thinking.\n\nExample from my \"*Wealth*\" category:\n\n* I will spend money on important things (not waste money on unimportant things but also not be stingy for important things)\n* I will increase my value and therefore increase my income (focus on value delivered to increase income)\n* I will grow my wealth through sensible investment (make sure I invest in a responsible way)\n\n# Step 4: Create projects\n\nI'm defining projects here as one off things you need to get done this year that don't necessarily fit into the life categories, and aren't exactly habits due to the fact that they don\u2019t happen frequently.\n\nThis is somewhat of a catch all for anything you might have missed in previous sections. Think of this as a **high level to do list**, and don't worry about the details)\n\nThese were my projects (once again grouped for convenience):\n\n* *To acquire*\n\t* *Build a PC*\n\t* *Move out*\n* *To set up*\n\t* *Improved LinkedIn profile*\n\t* *Set up an NFT wallet*\n\t* *Good CV*\n* *To organise*\n\t* *Road trips*\n\t* *Parties*\n* *To level up*\n\t* *Get good style*\n\t* *Get to 70 wpm*  \n\n# Step 5: Create rules\n\nNow we have gone over all the things you should do, we should also define the things you shouldn\u2019t do.\n\nThese also don't need to map to the life categories, but some useful prompts to think about are:\n\n* How am I wasting time?\n* How am I wasting money?\n* How am I being unhealthy? (food, sleep)\n* How am I making myself unhappy?\n\nAn important note is to not make the rules too intense (as this will cause you to give up on them). \n\n&gt; A lax rule that you actually follow is better than a strict rule that you don\u2019t.\n\t\n# Conclusion\nIf you have followed the steps and taken them seriously this plan should give you a very good idea of what your days/weeks/months should look like in terms of the things you need to do.\n\t\nAt the end of the process you should feel like:\n\n* You have given yourself clear goals with attached metrics that will improve your life\n* You have accounted for 99% of the things you need to do\n* You feel motivated and optimistic that you can implement the plan\n\nIf you can\u2019t agree with all of these statements, you might need to go back and spend some more time on whatever is causing you concern.\n\nI hope you found this process useful and good luck for the year to come!", "title": "How I planned My Entire 2022 In One Day"}, {"created_utc": 1641989431, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/s24u0z/managing_emotional_triggers_in_a_relationship/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just became self-aware of my trigger that usually leads to an argument with my girlfriend.

I was living with her during all of this. I told her my father was paying for it but obviously he wasn\u2019t. She found out and is understandably curious. This is by far the worst thing I have ever done and I can\u2019t believe how much I compartmentalized and justified it. It was a huge charade and I\u2019m a pathetic cowardly and stupid piece of shit for doing it. I know I can change and am so disgusted with myself that there is no choice but complete honesty from now on. And being the best version of myself I can be. I\u2019m addressing it in therapy and it\u2019s incredibly painful acknowledging what I\u2019ve done but I feel hopeful.\n\nMeanwhile, because this is a life long pattern I\u2019ve developed, of lying to avoid confrontation or punishment or just shame because I\u2019ve fucked up, my mom is understandably at her wits end. I am getting exactly what I had coming for me, but I\u2019m finding it increasingly hard to not cry, curl up in a ball, or scream after listening to her express her anger for hours on end. I know this is what I get for lying about something so huge to the person I\u2019m living with rent free. I want to take responsibility but I\u2019m not sure how to take it gracefully. I have tried extremely hard to listen, validate and empathize. Everything I say makes her angrier. She only found out yesterday but today she got mad remembering what I\u2019d done she kicked me repeatedly (not hard enough to bruise or anything). She told me tonight she was so mad she was close to murdering me and that I was going to send her to jail. She told me no one would put up with me, that I was a piece of shit, stupid, bad and like a \u201cdemonic 8 year old.\u201d She told me she wished she\u2019d never married my father or had kids and I shouldn\u2019t either because it makes life miserable. She told me I disgust her, she told me I have always been a liar and she has no hope for me, bringing up how I lied about \u201cnot having pubic hair\u201d at age 12 (true story, she was furious then too) and she said I added so much stress to my dead dog\u2019s life in her later years. She said she was so disgusted by me I made her physically sick. later she said she meant all of it and tomorrow she would try to act more polite but deep down this is how she really feels. And a lot of other things. \n\nI\u2019m 25f by the way. The thing is I know that I had this coming and this is what happens when you lie, but I\u2019m struggling to know how to respond without evading responsibility. It does really hurt to hear this, of course, but I also fucked up. Bad.\n\nAny advice?", "title": "How should I (25f) deal with my mom\u2019s (57f) anger when I completely deserve it?"}, {"created_utc": 1641973077, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/s20jn6/how_do_i_date_better/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a history of dating emotionally damaged men.

The start of the COVID pandemic really threw my life into a downward spiral and it really put an anchor on my progress as an adult and as a person. I live in Massachusetts, and I was just starting a great job at a new startup company before the pandemic. Was making good money, loved my work and was almost done with my junior year of college. Then, the pandemic came around and there was a state of emergency, and all non-essential businesses had to be shut down. Now, at the time I wasn't upset because I was able to make unemployment and believe it or not, made even more off that than I did at my job. I was making unemployment and didn't have to do a thing for months. I stayed at home playing video games all day, every day. All the money I had gotten from the government and unemployment ending up being spent on weed, and unnecessary junk. I made about $8k+ while being away from work and didnt save a dime of it. \n\nAfter those months of being away due to the shutdown, we were finally able to return to work. Two weeks after being back into work, I was laid off (along with 8 other people in my company). So, I went back to making unemployment again, and throwing myself into the sick cycle of eat, sleep, video games all day and blowing all my money on weed and unnecessary stuff. That unemployment didn't last forever, and I was eventually forced to find a minimum wage retail job that I could work at to cover the bills until I could find another job in my industry. I was living paycheck to paycheck trying my hardest to find another job so I can leave the retail environment and go back to doing what I love. \n\nHaving no success with any job searches and having to working a mediocre job, I became incredibly depressed. I became self-abusive, quit going to school, and spent whatever money I had on weed to self-medicate. I paid my bills late, but I always made sure to have money for weed as I felt they were the only things that were keeping me sane. I eventually was fired from my retail job at the end of 2020, and everything spiraled down from there. From the end of 2020 thru all of 2021, I was just living a cycle of eat, sleep, smoke, self harm. I would lie to get money and spend any money I had on weed. I became months late on bills and had to have relatives give me money to avoid repossession on my car or default on my student loans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had enough, however, I can never seem to talk myself into becoming better. It's like there's two sides of me going to war with each other. One side is the one who just wants to smoke and play video games all day, and then there's the side of me that wants to become a more responsible adult. No matter how many times I tell myself: \"Today is my last day of smoking\" or \"Im going to apply to jobs\" \"I'm going to save any money I get.\" I can never seem to make myself change even though I know what I am doing is wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a constant battle in my head. \"You should be saving money,\" \"You should stop smoking,\" \"You know you got bills coming up.\" It always ends up being chalked up to a \"Oh well.\" or \"I'll change eventually\" or \"I'll figure something out later.\" I don't know if I have some sort of disorder or what is causing this repetitive self-sabotage, but I need some help.

The aim here is to account for almost all the important things in your life, then tackle them one by one.\n\nThese are categories I think should be applicable to **everyone**:\n\n* Hobbies\n* Wealth\n* Health\n* Social relationships\n* Emotional wellbeing\n\nThese are additional categories I included in my plan:\n\n* YouTube\n* Learning/Career\n\nThese are some other categories that might generally be applicable to people\n\n* School \n* Art\n* Community \n\nBut don't feel constrained by the options above if care a lot about soccer and want to put it as a category even though it could fit into hobbies that is fine, it is your plan and you should put whatever is most important to you.\n\n# Step 1: Create goals for each category\n\nFor each life category you will want to create **3-5 goal items**, now each goal item will follow a particular format. They will be a goal pair of **input + output** goals. \n\n&gt; Input goals will be the ones that are measurable and completely in your control.\n\n&gt; Output goals will be the thing that you actually want and should happen as a result of the input goal.\n\nExample from my \"*Social*\" category:\n\n* *Output: I want to maintain strong friendships*\n* *Input:  I will reply to all messages daily*\n\n# Step 2: Create habits for each category\n\nWithin each category you should create all the relevant habits you will need to achieve this goal. When making habit it is good to specify a frequency where possible. \n\nFor example in \"*Hobbies*\" I had the following habits (I also decided to group them for convenience):\n\n* *Media*\n\t* *1 movie from list twice per month*\n\t* *Spend 30 minutes on new music twice per month*\n\n* *Lego*\n\t* *Spend 1 hour per week on Lego*\n\t* *Spend 30 mins once per month buying Lego*\n\n* *Piano*\n\t* *Spend 1 hour twice per month on Piano*\n\t\n# Step 3: Create mindsets for each category\n\nI found it useful to create some mindsets for each category that will help remind me of its importance to motivate me, and give me useful ways of thinking.\n\nExample from my \"*Wealth*\" category:\n\n* I will spend money on important things (not waste money on unimportant things but also not be stingy for important things)\n* I will increase my value and therefore increase my income (focus on value delivered to increase income)\n* I will grow my wealth through sensible investment (make sure I invest in a responsible way)\n\n# Step 4: Create projects\n\nI'm defining projects here as one off things you need to get done this year that don't necessarily fit into the life categories, and aren't exactly habits due to the fact that they don\u2019t happen frequently.\n\nThis is somewhat of a catch all for anything you might have missed in previous sections. Think of this as a **high level to do list**, and don't worry about the details)\n\nThese were my projects (once again grouped for convenience):\n\n* *To acquire*\n\t* *Build a PC*\n\t* *Move out*\n* *To set up*\n\t* *Improved LinkedIn profile*\n\t* *Set up an NFT wallet*\n\t* *Good CV*\n* *To organise*\n\t* *Road trips*\n\t* *Parties*\n* *To level up*\n\t* *Get good style*\n\t* *Get to 70 wpm*  \n\n# Step 5: Create rules\n\nNow we have gone over all the things you should do, we should also define the things you shouldn\u2019t do.\n\nThese also don't need to map to the life categories, but some useful prompts to think about are:\n\n* How am I wasting time?\n* How am I wasting money?\n* How am I being unhealthy? (food, sleep)\n* How am I making myself unhappy?\n\nAn important note is to not make the rules too intense (as this will cause you to give up on them). \n\n&gt; A lax rule that you actually follow is better than a strict rule that you don\u2019t.\n\t\n# Conclusion\nIf you have followed the steps and taken them seriously this plan should give you a very good idea of what your days/weeks/months should look like in terms of the things you need to do.\n\t\nAt the end of the process you should feel like:\n\n* You have given yourself clear goals with attached metrics that will improve your life\n* You have accounted for 99% of the things you need to do\n* You feel motivated and optimistic that you can implement the plan\n\nIf you can\u2019t agree with all of these statements, you might need to go back and spend some more time on whatever is causing you concern.\n\nI hope you found this process useful and good luck for the year to come!", "title": "How I planned my entier 2022 in one day"}, {"created_utc": 1641947548, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/s1sc7d/i_feel_like_im_so_close_to_being_good_at_life_but/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "There\u2019s so much I want to do, that I almost do, but instead I do nothing.   \n  \nI want to explore new music and movies.

I slowly deleted social medias over years, and I've deleted all last of them yesterday. &gt;!

I needed to write all this.***\n\nI find myself at a point in my life where I am prepared to apply any type of change to reach my highest level. \n\nMy problem is ... I've been trying my whole life to impress others and seek their recognition. With that I have managed to get completely away from myself, not enjoying life, being indecisive and being a coward.\n\n**MY STORY**  \nI come from a pretty unstructured family. My father is a god-level narcissist. Since I was little, they made me believe that he was the best person in the world, the most intelligent, the most handsome, who would be successful only because of my image.\n\nMy father has ever told me I love you or asked for forgiveness. He bought all my love with gifts. Since I was little, it was great to have the best toys, trips, etc. He thought that was love. He never taught me how to be a man, he has given me the worst advice possible.\n\nAt school I would do well, I had my friends and you did the things that a child did. I was very clown, I loved to laugh, I was very curious. The problem came when I was 16-18 years old. I found a world that I did not expect ...\n\nBeing myself was not enough, it was no longer as simple as I thought. Now it was my turn to make an effort to make things happen. But I did not know how to do it, the effort was not something that I would have needed in the past, I never had to exert myself.\n\nAll that was a big problem for me, I did not know how to act. Solution? I started WISHING to please others. I established my personality by seeing how others behaved. One day I thought that something was wrong, another day that thing that was wrong yesterday was right today. I did not know how to put boundaries. I had a lot of anger inside of me, I limited it all the time since I didn't like who I was. But many days came in which that anger exploded and people moved away from me. That made me angrier with myself and I didn't like who he was.\n\nI watched movies and wanted to be like the main actors, I dreamed that people would see me succeed. Everything was/is very sad. He didn't recognize me, he didn't know who I was. I have cried many nights without knowing what to do with my life. Nothing motivated me, I had no hobbies, I only thought about others.\n\nOne thing that never changed, my instinct to tell me that things didn't have to be this way. For that reason, I have been going to the psychologist since I was 23 years old. That helped me not to go crazy.\n\n**NOWADAYS**  \nNow I am 33 years old, and thanks to all the therapies that I did and partly that I trusted myself. I have quite managed to overcome dependency on others. I still have thoughts and a desire to change for others, and others recognize how good I am. Now I recognize that voice and stop at it.\n\nAt this age, I have discovered that my father is a narcissist and I have seen all the behaviors I have learned from him. Is fucking scary\n\nThe difficulty that I find myself now is not knowing which way to go and this blocked me.\n\nI want to focus on myself, but there are always thoughts that others will say and I am afraid of taking a path other than within myself.\n\n**Now I come across the following list of drawbacks:**\n\n* I don't know what to talk to people about. I am very good at deep conversations, but when I have to talk about something else I go blank.\n* I don't know how to keep friends. It has been very easy for me to meet people and for people to want to meet me ... but I don't know how to keep them, I don't know when to write to them, what to talk about, enjoy their company.\n* Siempre he sido muy victimist, me he comparado con los dem\u00e1s y he sentido que la culpa siempre la tengo yo. Al tener ADHD, tengo mucha sensibilidad al abandono y eso hace que estropee muchas amistades por miedo. \n* The way I express myself, it seems like I only talk to my friends when I need something (my father does this).\n* My confidence is so low that I cannot look people in the eye, I end the conversations as soon as possible to avoid making a mistake.\n* ETC...\n\n**BEING A COWARD**  \nI put this aside since it is an issue that has me very concerned.  \nI have realized that I am a coward. I don't dare to do anything to do with interacting with people.\n\nThe other day I was reading a blog in which I said \"If your mother was there when your father was not, get up, give her a hug and tell her how grateful you are for having her in your life\", I need 30 minutes to do it , there was something inside of me that would not let me. And when I did it was in the weirdest way possible.\n\nSituations like this happen to me very often. Where I think more of others than of myself, I don't dare to take the step because I think this is not the time. One of the things I hate the most is when I'm in a club and I don't dare to talk to the girl I like, and if I dare I do my best to be a clown or cut off the conversation as soon as possible. I get very nervous.\n\nWhen I am walking the dog and I see that a neighbor is staying because he wants to talk to me, I tremble. I just want the conversation to end.\n\nThere is something inside me that makes me feel like it's the end of the world.\n\nI just want to be happy, but the voice that I have inside me is a son of b ...\n\nReading books is very good but in the end, all that remains in reading.

We planned to get our own place together after saving and securing stable jobs. Our living situation was a bit tense - I've been out of my routine and the privacy I used to rely on to get things done is gone. He was able to get a good job, but I've not gotten one yet. I started grad school in August and grew very detached from my studies, causing some poor grades and academic advisement. We've been arguing more, mostly about our dead bedroom situation that I caused. I've also felt that I've been needlessly mean to him as an outlet for my frustrations (let me clarify by saying that entails going to bed early, maybe zoning out of conversations, being a bit cold. Never ever verbally abusive or degrading, just not a generally supportive or enthusiastic partner). \n\nThe decision to break up was unplanned, but I don't regret it. I need to focus on building myself back up - academically, professionally, and most importantly in my health and relationship. It sounds counterintuitive to break up for love, but I hope that the distance between us is enough to encourage growth and to come back together stronger. Both of us are flawed and need the break up to push ourselves to see and work through those issues. He needs to stop putting me on a pedestal, seek therapy for his family issues, and learn to think beyond his immediate needs and desires. I need to figure out my new path and drive, to communicate my needs earlier, and to be more grateful for what I have while I have it. \n\nOverall, time and circumstances have made us codependent on each other with no clear vision of our own paths, just a puddle of promises that evaporate when we fall back into old patterns.\n\n He would never break up with me, always saying that all he needed for the rest of his life was me, but I need him to see that he deserves so much more beyond just that. He deserves to be his own person. \n\nHe's upset. He feels blindsided. He feels I've betrayed him. I really hurt him, but I'm deciding to be better for both of us. Hopefully he'll see that with time.

I\u2019ve said \u201clet it go\u201d before, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll say it again with the best intentions in mind but I\u2019ve finally come to the realization that focusing on letting go keeps me holding on. Oh, the irony of life, amiright? \n\nI\u2019m sure if you scroll through my posts you\u2019ll see me talking about letting go, and I\u2019m not going to pretend it\u2019s not a practice I\u2019ve tried to stick to. I\u2019ve burned pieces of paper with lists of things I\u2019m \u201cletting go of\u201d, I\u2019ve done the ceremonies focused around letting go, I\u2019ve set intentions during yoga practice to let what isn\u2019t serving me fall away forever, and then, the things I wished away stayed. \n\nI\u2019ve found through my journey that focusing on getting rid of something: whether it\u2019s feelings, expectations, moods, thoughts, habits, whatever- always leads to me somehow gripping to it even tighter for some reason. When you make something bad, or forbid it, it becomes this thing you need to hang onto. \n\nI\u2019ve found this true in so many ways, whether it was in my addictions to adderall + nicotine, unhealthy food mentality, relationships, victim mentality, anxiety, depression, emotions that just wouldn\u2019t \u201cgo away\u201d, I could name a million different situations in my life that I constantly wants to \u201clet go of\u201d and as hard as I tried, I just couldn\u2019t. \n\nOne day, I stopped fighting to let go. I accepted my addictions. I accepted my mental healthy. I accepted the thoughts and habits that had led me to the moment. I accepted the grief I once wished would go away. I accepted the feelings that were coming up that I didn\u2019t want to feel. I accepted my body. I accepted my situation. I just accepted my present moment as it was and realized that I was surviving with all of the things I thought I needed to let go of. \n\nI truly feel that we don\u2019t just magically let go of things. Time passes and we learn to live with certain situations. And in terms of the addictions to adderall and nicotine, I accepted that was my situation and I would feel uncomfortable feelings when I stopped taking them. I didn\u2019t let go of addictions or habits or feelings, I accepted they were what they were and I had a choice in what I decided to do with that fact. \n\nLetting go always seemed like this impossible task and I think often it is. We don\u2019t let go of grief. We don\u2019t let go of pain. We learn to live with it, and with that realization I understood it had less power over me and my actions than I thought it did. It became a back seat passenger in my life instead of the driver. \n\nI\u2019m here to say maybe it\u2019s time to stop focusing on letting go and just focus on accepting where you are and adding things you want instead of fighting what you don\u2019t want. I\u2019ve realized all emotions have purpose and they\u2019re not meant to be let go but felt, and in that feeling, like the true duality this life presents to us, it\u2019s grip on us lessens immensely. \n\nI know what it\u2019s like to hold on so tightly to everything. I know what it\u2019s like to feel like I have to just let everything go and the pressure that came with the realization that I didn\u2019t even know how I could possible do that because it literally was out of my hands. \n\nIt\u2019s time to focus on what you can do instead of forcing clich\u00e9s like let it go on yourself and others. I\u2019ve learned saying this actually is invalidating my and others\u2019 experiences causing me to hold on even more. \n\nLetting go isn\u2019t a choice. It happens over time sometimes. Sometimes it never does. So instead of working on letting go, work on accepting what is. And see where you can go from there. \n\n_\n\nTLDR; \n\nIt\u2019s time to focus on what you can do instead of forcing clich\u00e9s like let it go on yourself and others.

I'd love some suggestion how I can move forward?23F, Just graduated.\n\n**The Story**\n\nWhen I was young, my parents didn't have much time for me and I was largely neglected, or when they pay attention to me at all, it's usually them being angry over some minor mistakes. My mom can be easily set into rage and my dad is overbearing, perfectionistic and physically abusive (under the guise of 'discipline', I feel).I started to have problems when I entered a primary school, I disturb the classroom and causing a lot of troubles, my emotions were extremes and was too rowdy for them to handle. I had a lot of behavioural issues at the time so my mom was advised to take me to see a psychologist. The first we've met has determined me to just be undersocialised, and that my parents needed to take more time and effort in raising me. An answer my mom found to be insulting. So she wanted another answer to many behavioural issues and then she read about autism on a newspaper.\n\nSo she sought out 'autism specialist' to get me diagnosed and hope that would take some responsibility out of her as well as having a place that can deal with me, I wasn't sure about the process but I felt like a lot of things that surrounded that particular diagnosis was very questionable. Due to the nature of recordkeeping in my countries I can't get any details how that went - but I was (mis)diagnosed with Asperger's and sent to special education class for 10 years - till I was 16.\n\nI've never felt like autism was fitting for me nor found the treatment that's given to me helpful. I found my mental health and social ability was forcibly stunted due to lack of normal social opportunities, and my real issues regarding attachment and trauma wasn't addressed, my parents being extremely oversheltering was making things worse.\n\nI eventually left home for university at 19, and then suddenly I felt like a switch flicked in my brain. I just start to notice the way people interact intuitively as well as becoming more aware of my environment. And I started reading experiences of adult autistic people and I don't find myself relating to most symptoms. I don't seem to share a similar way of systemising or detail-oriented thinking, I do not have any sensory issues at all. My social issues as a teen/adult seem to stem from the fear of not being loved, abandonment and reactiveness to other's negative gestures. The anxiety and emotions prevented me from being socially appropriate, rather than the inability to read subtexts, contexts or nuance. (Growing up I was told that the only symptom of autism is emotions regulation, which is well, present in autistic people but to say it is the only main thing is unusual... one of the reason I found my situation fishy)\n\nI eventually saw two separate psychologists (both experienced with autism in adult) on my own to assess and give me opinions on the matter, their verdict went into the same way that **I do not qualify for autism criteria and Asperger's diagnosis was unlikely to be appropriate or helpful.** They do think that I have been very traumatised and developed attachment disorder to how I was raised... neglect and abuse. My therapist and GP have told me the same that I do not seem to be autistic. A teacher at high school who has been teaching for nearly 30 years and was particularly close with me said the same. (he know about more high functioning kids). None of my friends seem to think that I am autistic too. (even if they point out that i can be very insecure and socially difficult)...\n\nThe old diagnosis was gone. It's revoked... I'm not autistic I should be happy, but I'm not.\n\n**How can I move on?**\n\nThe problem about me now is that I'm ashamed of my past. Feeling that I was irreversibly ruined. I can seem to accept what happened.\n\nI missed my teen years due to lacked of opportunities to socialise, when I was just out of special education I was very awkward (due to lack of experiences) and didn't get to have many friends. I was bullied and didn't get to do high school teen things that seem like the rite of passage... I know that correct age to do things are mostly bullshit... but there's that feeling of missing out doing something 'at the right time'\n\nI feel like a loser because well, I was a high school loser among people who don't understand what i've been through. Kids see a weird kid just as a target.  - And now when I finally got a chance to parties, having friend groups, trying out with dating at university ... it seem like everything lost the magic. It's fun, but there's no 'high' of being an untouchables like the high school popular kids...It feels like I missed the opportunities a lot of opportunists to develop my personality. I can become 'better' and improve myself.. but I'll still be a little fucked up. Would you understand that this kind of thing can happen? I just feel like I shouldn't really exist.\n\nWhat I also hate is that due to my situation, I didn't get opportunities to learn a lot of skills I want to be good at when I was young.\n\n\\- Would it be so strange for you if you've met someone seemingly normal, until they revealed that these rare, strange medical mistakes happened in the past? Would you question these people?- Would it be strange if I try to work on my social skills and personality that I am quite sociable... then you come to know later that I was a 'weird kid' no one like in high school? Would people still like me when I'm supposed to be unchangeable (by what media says) and disliked?.. And would it be shameful to be a 'late bloomer' in some certain skill... it seems like only young prodigies get celebrated these days?\n\nThese are irrational thinking but I feel chained to missed opportunities and bad images.\n\nEveryone life's different, I know. I actually have a current career goal what I want to do in the future. I still have hope to push forward. My life isn't horrible - **but I am ashamed of my situation.

For a bit of background, I've said since the day we moved into this house that I hated it. I hated everything about it- the neighbors, the rooms, the layout- everything I could possibly hate about this place. I spent every waking moment begging to move somewhere else or be anywhere that wasn't here. \nNow, almost 7 years later, my wish has come true. But, it's not as joyous as I hoped it'd be. At least, I didn't feel as ready to just leave as I thought I was. Everytime I looked at certain areas of the house, I'd tear up, thinking about all the memories that are far behind me now. \nTonight though, I finally realized that these aren't tears of sadness. They're tears of gratitude. \nThe thing is, for years I begged to leave this place. So much so, that I never stopped to consider just what I'd be leaving behind. \nTonight, as I walked through the house that became my childhood home, I've finally let myself come to appreciate all the things that I've had here. \nWhen I looked around my near-empty room, I remembered playing with my childhood friends and watching movies. I remembered my dog, who passed away a few months ago, as I stared at where her bed used to be. I remembered the happy moments I had with the dog who saved my life when I was in a deep depression.\nI remembered the self-discovering journeys I had in this room. The moments that ignited my passions and that made me who I am. It was like reliving my whole life in the span of a few hours. \nMy tears were never of sadness, and I wore a smile on my face the whole time as I realized something. This is not the end of my story. Moving does not mark the end of my book nor the end of everything I have loved here. But much like Avengers:Endgame, this move marks the end of an era for me. And I have decided that I am ready to embrace it.\nI'm writing this post because I have decided that with this new era- this new chapter of my story, I will take to heart every lesson I have learned in this house and continue to grow as a person. I will reopen myself to the possibilities of the world and allow myself the chance to move on from what once held me back. If there's anything I have learned from living in this house it is this: The sad thing about life, is that we often don't know what we have until it's gone. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. \nI've never been good about gratitude. I can be bratty sometimes and a bit rude, but I am thankful for everything I have learned and experienced in this house. I am grateful for whatever fate brought me here to experience all that I have. I wasn't always happy in the moment, but I am thankful for every moment I spent in this house. And no matter what, I won't forget the lessons I have learned. I will remember everything fondly- even the bad parts.", "title": "I'm Moving Houses In A Few Days And As The Reality Hits Me, I Feel Gratitude"}, {"created_utc": 1611901207, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7lbqh/jealousy_is_destroying_me_im_24_i_should_have/", "num_comments": 15, "score": 1, "selftext": "Some background on me: (scroll down to ***** for the jealousy)\n\nI'm a 24-year-old male and I'm a sorry excuse for a man.\n\nI feel like I'm still a kid inside, haven't matured and haven't grown with the world around me.\n\nI suffer from multiple mental illnesses and have for the most part gotten that under control with therapy and medication. \n\nI'm a fairly good-looking guy, from bring told by more than a handful of people.

People fear and despise me. The very name invokes, fear, hatred,  and suspicion. The mere accusation of being a werewolf is often enough to ruin lives and careers, regardless of how fair the accusation is. \n\nPeople have this perception of werewolves being loners, outcasts, or those who don\u2019t fit in. This is wrong. We must fit in, in fact we are masters of it. Hiding who we are and appearing outwardly as respectable citizens is a skill we mastered long ago. \n\nWe are monsters of course. We eat people. And those that we only bite become us. We have a disease and it spreads from perpetrator to victim. \n\nI don\u2019t blame people for shunning us. I just wish they\u2019d try for some compassion and remember that we are people too, even if we are monsters. We have hopes, we have fears, we love, he dream, we cheer for our favorite sports teams. We just have a disease, one that makes us monsters. \n\nWe did not choose to be werewolves. Most of us were ourselves bit by a werewolf and the rest acquired the disease some other way. We are monsters but we did not choose to be as we are.\n\nThe condition causes a nearly irresistible compulsion to eat people. We hunger for human meat as ordinary people crave chicken, pork, and beef. But not just any human meat, living, raw meat.\n\nLike I said we are monsters. But get inside our heads for a moment and feel for one second the pull that our attraction creates and you will understand why we do it. \n\nI\u2019m not condoning it. Eating people is wrong. I confess that I have eaten people. \n\nSome of us make do by drinking human blood which reduces our urges to manageable levels. But the fact is this is barely better than eating people because somewhere a person was killed. The only difference is that one person\u2019s blood can satisfy a great many werewolves urges rather than just one which is why we justify our drinking of blood as the lesser of two evils. But it\u2019s still wrong and we know it.\n\nThere is a number of us that manage to control our urges completely. It requires an extraordinary amount of dedication and self control. On the level of monastic devotion to self improvement. To completely give up blood and meat is a Herculean task requiring an unshakable character. It requires us to deny the most powerful and basic instinct in our predatory brains.\n\nIt is a task I have now begun. I wish to cast off this stigma and live as a human once again. I no longer wish to be ashamed of myself for what I am. \n\nIt will not be easy. I have severed all contact with my blood suppliers and I am taking measures to make sure I can not eat somebody if I lose control. I am deciding to be better than myself. What is better, to be born good or to overcome one\u2019s evil nature thorough great effort? \n\nBut even if I manage to completely eliminate meat and blood from my life the disease will always be a part of me. There is no cure. I will love always until the day I die knowing that i am at the most fundamental a monster.\n\nAll that I can do is be the least bad that I can be.

I am 27 (M) she is 28 (F).\n\nMy ex and I were together for 6 years. I became very close with her family and siblings. Constantly going over to their houses for family events, dinners, and doing double dates with her siblings and their partners. Each week we made sure to go on a date forsure and spent many other days throughout our entire relationship. My ex and I were best friends, she doesnt have any friends. We took trips each year together, we got 2 animals together, we lived together for 4 years together. I would always do romantic gestures like leaving things on her car after work, or flowers randomly, or bath and spa nights. I put her on a pedastal and did my best to make her feel truly loved. \n\nWe never fought and honestly barely had any arguments about things. Thats how well we fit together. Similarly we had many of the same interests and even tried each others interest. I was there for her through tough times when both of her grandparents tragically passed away. I was an usher to walk the caskets down, which can tell you how close I was to her family. Each year I went with her family on family trips. \n\nFurther, we had similar values. We both didnt smoke, didnt do drugs, highly valued our religion that we share and had many similar world views and values for relationships. We valued each other enough to stay in communication every day no matter what by texting or talking. When we lived together, it was never an issue with cleanliness, cooking, etc. We both did our part and never expected the other to have to do such. We had similar future goals and dreams (travel, marriage, family, living on a lake, etc.) \n\nI can continue, but lets just say that we both felt very happy and in love together. We both expressed this daily. I never lied to her, I never cheated on her, I never did many things that would hurt someone outright. Further, I always tried to support her with her trauma and her own issues.\n\nNow for what happened:\n\nMy ex has a trauma history from her past 2 relationships. Abuse and lying. Neither relationship lasted more then 6 months. This happened when she moved away for college before she met me. She mentioned it to me, and told me how she can find it difficult to trust at times because of this. I always remembered this and made sure to never do anything sexual when we drank because I didnt want her to feel any negative way regarding that. As well, I consistently tried to build that trust and never hurt that trust until this last year.\n\nShe grew up homeschooled with all of her siblings in a strict household ran by her narcissistic and autistic father. For example, living at home at 28 she still has a curfew otherwise her dad yells at her. She fears her parents and wanta to make them happy and proud, seeking validation by doing right constantly. An example of this was when she started college it was for a career they suggested. Being in this environment, she has social anxiety and thus has 0 friends. All the years I was with her she made 3 friends and cut them out within 2-3 hangouts. \n\nMy ex was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and that was before we met. Those things all but went away or here I thought the first 5 years.\n\nSo no issues for 5 years, 6th year we have 3 things happen. I was planning to get engaged in 2021. As well, after college (end of 2019) we both moved back to our parents houses as we searched for our first jobs post college. Covid began, making it hard.\n\nFirst thing:\n\nMy ex and I go to my cabin. She gets on an ATV with my cousin, I make sure they both have helmets and I tell my younger cousin she needs to drive very responsibly because my girlfriend was on it. She said thats okay and I even told my ex if she would rather drive with me she can, yet she was alright going with my cousin. \n\n15 minutes later they are involved in a head on collison with a truck going around a very sharp turn at like 15 miles per hour. I was following them in my car and I was behind them by like a few hundred yards so I didnt see it happen due to the curve. Anyways I ran to my exes side. Held and compressed her leg as she was bleeding. Fast forward, I followed to the hospital and went into her room and waited the whole time with her. She was able to leave within 2 hours and had a tear in her muscle behind her knee, as well as a traumatic brain injury, and further a deviated septum.\n\nWe go back to my cabin, and I pretty much take care of my ex the next 24 hours til we leave for home. I helped her bathe, get dressed, made meals, grabbed ice or heat stuff, and even tried cheering her up by watching comedies she likes. \n\nAfter dinner my aunt (mother to my cousin) asked me for help. I asked what for and she explained to me that my cousin didnt finish her test to drive the ATV before we left. I told her that I feel uncomfortable doing that and so I opted out. An hour later she asks me again but now tells me that if I dont that the state could sue my grandparents. My grandparents live month to month on their retirement and social security, thus I felt obligated. Later I found out they had insurance and that she was manipulating me. However in this moment my ex felt like I broke her trust by taking this test that I felt obligated to take. She felt like I intentionally set out to cover it up that my cousin should not have been driving. I see where she is coming from but also I felt pressured into it by my aunt and I explained this to her but she said it hurts her still and her trust was broken. I apologized by writing her a letter explaining how I never intentionally meant for that.\n\nNow fast forward 2 months, my ex is still healing and I bring up possibly going to my cabin for a holiday and asking if she wanted to go. She said absolutely not, because my uncle and cousin may be there. I said I understand but this worried me because I was thinking about our future and how it would work regarding family occasions. I brought this up to her and we had a disagreement about it. I asked if they could come to a future wedding of ours, or if we held a family holiday would they be able to come? To which she said again absolutely not. I expressed how I felt about this considering this uncle was the one I was closest to. I said do you think in time your feelings will change? And she said no because of the permanent damage she felt from the accident. Then she brought up covering up for my cousin and that I should never speak to them again because of the pain they put her through via the accident and trust breaking. I took about a week to consider everything. During this time she thought and convinced herself I was choosing them over her BECAUSE I was arguing with her about them being in my life for future events. My family members also never reached out past the first week following the accident and she felt hurt by this. Yet, I reached out constantly and was supporting her healing process. I even wrote to her parents my apology for the damage she had been dealt. Unfortunately I will touch upon this later but her dad banished me from their house and family events.\n\nI blocked my cousin, aunt, and uncle and sent them a long message regarding everything. Up to this point 2 months after the accident I had not spoken to them, and had been supporting my ex's healing progress. So not only did I not speak to them, but I blocked them and wrote what they did wrong and how it was not acceptable. Thus in this moment choosing her over my family members. She came back at the end of that week despite all of this and said my actions showed I chose my family over her and she felt very hurt by this. She said my actions to argue against her for people who hurt her was clear to her how I felt. These arguments were never yelling or anything, it was simply me asking if they would be able to be at certain events and my reasoning why I would appreciate them there. And even after me making my actions clear about not speaking to them since, and blocking them, she still felt betrayed because as she said, \"my actions are clear and you chose them over me.\"\n\nWell we dropped this topic moving forward because she was focusing on healing and I blocked them. Yet she still seemed hurt. Now her father is a great person, yet he is strict and he has autism. She never shared with her parents all the details. Simply the details of the accident. Before the accident I was at her house 2/7 days in a week I would say because that way my ex and I could see each other because she liked being at home. Then 2/7 days at my house. And 1 of those 4 days we would do a full date all day or all night. Anyways, since the accident her father grew very resentful to me. Despite my apology in writing, and even in person. He would argue with my ex that she needed to break up with me and that I was not a good person because I let her get on a dangerous machine. Mind you my ex is 27 and I am not controlling thus I did what I could by warning my cousin to be safe and giving them helmets. So her father blamed me, and he told I am not allowed over to their house. So now, my ex and I only saw each other at my house and less. Even so, my ex told me that she had to lie to her father where she was going because he would consistently yell at her to break up with me because I am not a good person for letting her get hurt.\n\nFast forward 3 more months, were still doing weekly dates and still having sex frequently. We are getting into a better place as we close into graduating. At this time, we were at our parents doing internships. I still am not allowed over and she is even having me pick her up a street over because she did not want her dad to see when we would spend time together. This was hard for me but I never argued about it and just understood despite how bad I felt that her dad hated me when I didnt cause the accident. We are spending less time together because of her father on her back, and because she doesnt prefer to always come to my house (I have smokers in the house and she hates the smell, as do I but I need to deal with it until I could move out again) i would always spray and light candles to make it better.\n\nEvent 2:\n\nNow another month forward we are now into the beginning of 2020, we find out that we are unexpectedly pregnant. We used birth control but it must have failed. She brings out the test and as I wait I am smiling thinking about everything. When she brings them both out they are both positive I hug her and then I begin to have a panic attack. Let me make an important note here, I have an anxiety disorder which she knew about. My panic is breathing heavy, heart racing, face likely looking panicked, and intrusive thoughts. These thoughts began to come out, as I explained to her this: \"I am so grateful and happy for this. I am worried though because neither of us have jobs, we are living at our parents and you dont want to live with me because of your parents, as well your parents are going to be mad at me even more then they were with the accident.\" She begins to cry, and tells me this is suppose to be a happy moment. I tell her I agree 100%, and I am happy, but we are going to need to figure some things out so that we stay happy. I dont want her and I to struggle financially in any way, I grew up poor and thats why I push myself to work and find a career. She agrees but still seems really sad. \n\nI see her about a week later and she begins telling me we need to go to her therapist. I ask why and she says we need to make a big decision. Continuing I ask whats that. She said we have 3 options, keep our baby, give our baby up for adoption, or abortion. I tell her thats okay and we go to her therapist. During this session she breaks down crying because she is worried about everything, she speaks for atleast have of the session about her parents and why she is worried they will disown her, and why she is worried about their opinion about premarital sex and a baby our of marriage. We leave with the therapist telling us to come back in a week with pros and cons for each option. \n\nAfter seeing her cry and worry, I spent the next month looking for work 8 hours a day. Yet it was covid layoffs happening and so I couldnt find squat. Anyways, a week later I bring my pros, my cons, as does she. I preface the talk with saying I want to keep our baby, I have been looking for work, and I dont want her parents to be a reason why we choose something like this. Then I also say I will continue to step up.\nWe give our pros and cons for each and hers are mostly focused on her parents and the lack of financial security. I understand and we talk about the options in therapy.\n\nAnother week and at this point we are going together to all of the doctors appointments. She talks to me and asks me what do I want to do? I tell her she seems pretty set on abortion based on our talk in therapy, that I want to keep our baby, but if not then I still want children in our future. She tells me she is leaning on abortion, and I tell her I will have to support this decision.\n\nFinally she and I go to a doctors appointment and the whole time I am nervous because the night before I was highly debating buying an engagement ring and proposing to her. Yet, I was arguing with myself because I didnt want her to feel like I was doing this only because of the situation. During this appointment I was in my head and distant as I contemplated it. Afterwards, she mentioned how my actions were pretty clear in this appointment that I was against having our baby. I told her I was only distant because I have something on my mind I cannot share with her, because mentally I still hadnt decided. She didn't believe me. I couldnt pull the trigger because like I said I didnt want her to resent me thinking that I was only doing it for this reason.\n\nA week later she scheduled the abortion and told me that she decided to go forward with the abortion. \n\nThe day comes and I drive her there, outside I tell her we can leave and that we do not need to go in. She trudged in, and seemed very distant, understandably why. We go into the room and I am asking all of these questions out of concern for her during this. And then we wait, I told her we could leave, but she said no. \n\nIt happens and then I bring her home and do my best to make everything both comfortable and enjoyable by making her favorite dinner, and watching her favorite movie etc.\n\nWe do not talk about it and do not have sex for 2 months. I told her I am not going to pressure any of that and when she is ready we can go slow into whatever she wants to do. We are having good sex again, but she is very worried about anything getting into her. So we begin to see her therapist again, still we both are looking for jobs, and still doing our weekly dates as best as we can with covid and not being able to go to her house. \n\nFast forward 2 more months. And she got a job! I am still looking because in my field (teaching) they were distance learning and not in need of subs nor teachers. Soon summer was upon us and she was working 40 hours a week.\n\nEvent 3:\n\nWell by this time, I was pretty depressed by the abortion, the previously mentioned betrayal she felt from the accident, and now my lack of finding work. On top of all of that, with her working so much, I only got to see her max 9 hours a week. I associate that to both her busy schedule and her withdrawing from me. But during this time, I would mention getting married in our future and having a family when we are ready and simply telling her I still wanted that. I maybe brought it up once a month and she would cry and tell me she is not ready right now for those and that in the future she might be. I would tell her, I fully understand and that I only bring it up to assure her I still wanted that with her. \n\nWell for 3 months we handle this, and juggling little time spent together on her end, I had a bunch of free time because I was still looking for work. I would ask her to go out and do things (hikes, walks, water activities, movies, etc.) And she would tell me how she is busy and cannot until the weekend. Before all of this her and I would go on walks almost 4/7 days if not more with her dog for like an hour. I was becoming needy because I would ask her to include me in those things. I would sometimes cry and ask her if she wanted to see me, and she would respond that she sees me already as much as she wanted to in a week (9 hours). \n\nShe had me over for a family bbq and mind that at this time I had not been over to her house in almost 9 months. When I use to come over for many hours every week and help out her mom and spend time with my ex and her family. When I was there I was nervous. I stayed outside in the backyard with her siblings. When they wanted to go into eat, I denied the food because I didnt feel welcomed by her father and thus I didnt want to eat the food out of fear of him saying something. Well they grab food and come back out. My ex however does not. 3 minutes later I get a text telling me to leave and meet her near her house because her dad just yelled at her when they were alone in the kitchen. I slipped out and we take a walk and she is hurt, her dad told her that if she didnt get me off their property he was going to divorce her mom because of her. This hurt me deeply that he would say that. I texted her mom telling her thank you for inviting me and that her husband told my ex those things. \n\nNow to the most current thing:\n\nStill in this realm of feeling sad due to time spent, and everything, my ex and her family go on their family vacation. The one normally I always go on, yet I was not even invited and my ex never brought up considering inviting me. They leave for a week and I am happy for them to be going.\n\nWhen they return I plan a date for my ex and I the following day. It goes really well until the end. She begins telling me about the trip and how her sisters friends went. This made me feel sad and left out and I began to cry. I explained that I just felt excluded from her life the past few months. Especially now between the bbq and the trip where other people not even affiliated with any family member aside from being friends with them was invited. As well as the lack of her inviting me to do things we use to do together.\n\nShe is mad and tells me it is completely out of her control. And I tell her I understand completely that part (cabin/bbq) yet I wish she would try to invite me to more parts of her life I can be a part of.\n\nThe next day she is majorly distant, and so I call her and she tells me she is pissed at me. I give her a few days. Then we meet up and essentially she tells me that she doesnt know if she can give me what I need anymore. Going on to tell me that she doesnt see a future together, she doesnt want to have children with me, doesnt want to get married. She tells me that she spent a week having fun and that I ruined it by bringing all of that up. Then that we need to have space and a seperation. 1 month but we are still together she clarifies and that were not dating other people.\n\n2 weeks pass, and she texts me she cannot do it anymore. She calls me and tells me she wants to break up. I beg and plead, and she tells me she doesnt trust anything I say, she feels heart broken, she feels I hurt her, and that my actions have showed her this. She tells me she has given me many chances and that she keeps getting hurt. I try to defend myself by saying I understand but I have never made the same repeated mistakes of hurting her. She says nonetheless that they happened and unintentional or not, she is done being hurt. This hurts me because I truly never did do the same mistakes over and over again. She ends the call by telling me I love you.\n\nA week later we meet in person to talk about the break up. We talk for 3 hours. During this talk, she tells me many things that floor me mentally but I simply just take it because I didnt want the possible last moment to be negative. \n\nShe tells me that she has had so much clarity the last 3 weeks. She said that she realized first that I broke her trust and that really hurt, but then being she was in such a vulnerable place from this moment with the accident that when she had to decide about our baby, that I WAS THE REASON she chose to have the abortion. She goes on to say that my actions showed her I didnt want to have our baby with her, that my actions of having a panic attack and being distant were clear to her (despite me never once thinking I didnt want to have our baby with her). She broke down telling me this and I simply told her repeatedly I am sorry you believe that but that was not the case and it seems what I tell you, you do not believe. She said my actions were clear. So she essentially blamed me for our abortion, and the accident. Yet I chose her in the accident by both supporting her and blocking my family, as well, with the abortion I was supportive of her and keeping our baby, not to mention she never brought this up ans her reasons were focused on her parents opinion and her fear of that.\n\nThen she goes on to say our relationship became so toxic the last year that she now needs to find herself and heal. That she needs major space and time and that maybe in the future we could be together. Then she said she may need years of space from me to have a clean slate from what I did to her. She said she loves me, that I am an amazing person and I will have a great life. She will always care about me and is grateful for the amazing times we spent together. But she said she needs to do what is right for her. \n\nShe removed myself, my friends, and all of my family members from social media. Removed all of our photos and posts. Did not block, but asked me not to contact her. Which I have respected for months now. She said I can keep the animals and all of our belongings in storage from when we lived together. She has 0 friends as I believe I mentioned before because she has trouble both connecting and trusting them. But her one sibling that I am still friends with has posts on her wall that my ex posted and tagged her in so I can see them. They are about essentially \"Someone who loves you wouldnt do this, or someone who loves you shows you in their actions\" and other stuff seemingly out of resentment towards me. \n\nSince our breakup I have felt deep deep remorse, for our abortion, and the blame she put onto me. As well, grief, from her leaving me and outright projecting so much of her pain she never mentioned previously onto me.\n\nI have been doing better each day, working 3 jobs now, planning trips, and my future. Been on depression medication that helps also my anxiety for months since our breakup and seeing 2 therapists weekly. \n\nSo of course this was a long story. Sorry. But I wanted to get it out of my mind since I havent been sharing this with anyone except my therapists. \n\nWhat is your take on what has transpired? I am struggling deeply with all her blame. I feel like I was supportive and she told me I was not as much as I could have been. Meaning I didnt meet her expectations and ultimately she concluded by that, that I was just downright NOT supportive at all. Which like I said I feel is so untrue :(\n\nTLDR: My ex and I had no issues, then it all fell apart after an accident, her abortion, and a lack of spending time together this last year.

Any help is appreciated!\n\nIt's been a shitty year (I know, understatement for a lot of us). \n\nI know that it's not as bad for me as some folks have it - I'm lucky in that I haven't lost anyone in my immediate family to COVID, I still have a job, a roof over my head, and food in the fridge, and a wife who loves me - so things could be a LOT worse.\n\nSince COVID started though, I've been becoming someone I don't want to be. I used to work out regularly and eat healthy - instead, I've let myself be lazy and I'm more likely to reach for cookies or chips than a salad. That led to me putting on about 9kg (20 pounds in freedom units), and has seriously affected my self-image. I struggled with self-image even before COVID - now, I look in the mirror and am disgusted by what I've become. \n\nThose issues with self-image have led (at least in part) to problems with being intimate with my wife. I don't feel confident getting naked in front of her, even though I know she loves me for who I am not what I look like.  That turned into it being easier to throw on porn some nights while she slept, and jerk off quickly rather than try to have sex. At first it was a couple nights per week, then every night, then I was doing it while I should have been working during the day too. It felt good in the moment, but after I finished it would all come crashing down - the anxiety, the sadness, the shitty feelings, all of it. I'd delay finishing for hours, just keeping on the edge because I knew when I was done I'd feel like crap. \n\nThis is all exacerbated by career stuff. Not that my career is in danger - quite the opposite, in fact. I'm up for a promotion this year, so I'm expected to put in extra hours and go the extra mile to show that I deserve that next step. I've also enrolled in a couple of courses part-time at the local college, to fill in some of the skills that I'm missing. But these behaviors are leading to me getting behind in the deadlines for those projects - which in turn, is turning the anxiety dial to 11. It's nothing I can't recover from (I'm a hard worker, or at least I used to be) but it's definitely not helping. \n\nYesterday, I had an epiphany in the despair after I finished - that what I was doing would eventually lead to martial problems, health problems, and financial problems (if I kept doing it when I should be working). My actions would have REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES. I needed to stop. So I deleted my 'porn' accounts permanently, had a workout and a healthy dinner, and got a good night's sleep. \n\nThis is day 0 without porn, and I'm going to have another workout after work today (I'm writing this during my lunch break).

I\u2019m a University of Cambridge graduate and Student Doctor and I wanted to share my experience trying melatonin (10mg) for better sleep.\n\nFirst, I\u2019ve always struggled with sleep ever since I was a kid and so when presented with the opportunity to try something that could help I jumped at the opportunity.\n\nI found that though melatonin always made me more sleepy; it didn\u2019t *necessarily* put me to sleep. Whenever I took, I would yawn a lot more and feel both physically and mentally exhausted and sometimes that was all I need to fall asleep \u2014 other times not so much.\n\nThat said, melatonin has the advantage of being relatively safe for use in the short term and doesn\u2019t really make you drowsy the next morning.\n\nMoreover, there is some *preliminary* research coming out that indicates that melatonin can act as a powerful anti-oxidant and is anti-inflammatory; helping to prevent an array of neurodegenerative illnesses like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.\n\nFinally, if you intend to take melatonin I would recommend you don\u2019t take a relatively large dose like I did (10mg). Most healthcare providers would recommend you take a much smaller dose (around 3mg) around 3-4 before your intended bed time.\n\nI actually discuss all this in my latest YouTube video and also talk about the various side effects that I experienced too!

Our marriage isn\u2019t perfect and we have needed to focus on it for a while. We\u2019ve been through some trauma (no cheating, no domestic violence or abuse, things out of our control) that has, from a common sense point of view, taken away our ability to focus on our relationship per say, because we\u2019ve had to just focus on getting through the events as they have come. It felt to me that we had grown apart and I have felt so broken and worthless. I felt like I should release him to move on to better things and let him have a possible future where he could enjoy his life without his \u201csad wife.\u201d I didn\u2019t think he would mourn the loss. We had that conversation on the evening of Jan 1st. He reacted.. not how I would have imagined. We did not split up. It\u2019s been 28 days of very intense arguments, some very tender moments, some truth telling, some late nights where neither of us were sure exactly what to say. We started counseling. I started therapy. I joined this sub. And although I haven\u2019t \u201crecovered...\u201d we have recovered some things we had lost in our relationship along the way. \n\nMy reality is, I don\u2019t know why this man loves me, or wants to be with me. When I told him that, and I told him, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you are willing to work so hard for me, when I have been struggling for so long. I\u2019m a ghost of my former self.\u201d His response was, \u201cTo me, you are still the woman I fell in love with and the woman I married. I know you still have the potential to be the woman who got me through (x,y,z what we went through), I know you still have the potential to be the woman who did those things. I know you are still the woman who made (city where we live) my home. You are still the person who gave me a family. You didn\u2019t stop being that person because you started struggling..\u201d bla bla bla.. sweet and sappy things like that.\n\nA few days ago, he asked me if I would be interested in going back to CrossFit classes. The idea was too much for me to hope for. I used to be very active and very fit, but we went through some poor ass times! CrossFit is not cheap. I\u2019m not working right now. One of my biggest issues is how much he works and how little quality time we have together, and how when he comes home he continues to go over his schedule to prepare for the next day, and he can\u2019t stop thinking and talking about work. I didn\u2019t understand how adding an expense to our budget could make anything better. But we talked about it some more. We went over the budget (I manage it and pay the bills, so I\u2019m rightly the one with the most financial anxiety, and he is the \u201cI\u2019ll just work more,\u201d guy which.. we are working on..). So it\u2019s still in the planning stage. But it was his idea. He knew this was something that I would be passionate about. Something that would motivate me to get out of bed a few days a week. Something he is willing to work hard to give me. \n\n50% of me doesn\u2019t want to do it because that part of me would rather keep sleeping from 10am-1pm every day, avoid the anxiety of leaving the house and interacting with people. But the other half of me feels the potential for that surge of happy chemicals, confidence, strength, camaraderie, and purpose. So of course I\u2019m going to do it. I\u2019m anxious about how out of shape I am but that\u2019s what\u2019s perfect about CrossFit, you don\u2019t have to be in shape to start, and I have history with it so I\u2019m not walking in to a totally new experience. I\u2019m never going to be ready to start doing anything but this is how recovery goes I guess. \n\nPretty thankful for my partner.

That isn't what has caused my problems though, this is to clarify.  \n**ONE** of the problems, that I have had for the last years, is exactly that, my drug use, but I have gotten a grip and out of my problematic life, and have started to work on my life, exactly due to that, drug use. The key thing is what kind of drug and how much I use of it.\n\nI have mainly used Dextromethorphan as an escape from reality for the past 6 years. Dissociating myself from who I am in life, since it is too painful to be that person. While the whole point of drug use, mainly is to do exactly that, Dextromethorphan, as an Dissociative Anaesthetic is a different story than most other type of drugs, like Cocaine, Meth, Heroin, or LSD or so on. Dissociatives, have a very distinct feature, which is very bad for one person. That is SEVERE Memory Impairment.\n\nHow can you progress in life, when you forget who you are, what your reality is, and the lessons you learned from yesterday every single day, and start a new life every single day, since you have no functioning memory. I literally just wake up the next day, or after a few days, and kind of follow my mistakes again and again, and repeat that cycle for about 6 years. The reason I said 4 years above, is because, when I was in school or university, I kind of stayed away from that, by following my dream, to become a doctor, and had a personal life to work on, and REMEMBERED THAT.  \nFor the past 4 years, I had literally forgotten I had a personal life, and had stopped working on it, as a career. I had only gotten into relationships with girls, and taken care of their life, and taken care of them, thinking about them all the time, and what they need. That is my main problem.\n\n***I stopped working on My own life. And Was interested in the life of somebody else all the time.***\n\nThis apperantly lead to me not succseeding in my career and what I want from life (which I have wanted for about 12 years now) again and again, for about 4 years.\n\n**I only escaped from my own reality by using drugs, and then went to my partner to see how her reality is, and tried to help her, forgetting I have a life in the first place and working on it.**\n\nThe thing is, I have wasted following my mistake for 4 years, and just now started working on my life.  \nI realise who I am just now.  \nAnd at this point, everyone around me is just fed up with me repeating my mistake again and again, Keeping a promise I will change my life, and then failing because of not remembering I have a life and working on it.\n\nI live in Bulgaria, here people are literally butfuck anti-social, there isn't any social place to go to when you need contact sadly.  \nAnd the people here aren't really friendly either, they only use you if you meet a new person.\n\n    If you are willing to give some advice for me, or want to help, do so, but please start with advice for the following. This is one major thing I need advice for ASAP:  As of right now, I am currently faced with this life: I have NOBODY in my life. My partner and I have agreed to go our separate ways, since not only I am problematic, but also she is too problematic to be a friend with anyone or in a relationship, since she only kills the life of that partner she is with.  I have no friends/ close people to really help me. Maybe a few, from school, but at most I can see them once a month or even rarer. I am literally alone at my house, isolated from EVERYTHING but the internet. I have nowhere to go, nothing to do, no way of meeting new people. (at least it seems that way) And need to basically start studying 12 hours a day, NON-STOP, since I want to follow Medicine, and am square 0. I have to learn like 2000 a4 pages for 5 months worth of information, meaning I have to study all day long daily alone and isolated from everybody if I want to have a brighter future, in the next 6 months.  I AM WILLING TO DO JUST THAT. BUT IT WILL BE EXTREMELY EMOTIONALLY DEMANDING. I am asking if anyone can give a suggestion on how to make it more possible for me to not get desperate and escape from reality again and again, since this has been my problem for the past years and the reason I have not worked on myself, by being in the life of my partners, or by abusing drugs all day long daily and playing pc games daily while high.  I WANT TO STUDY ALL THE TIME AND FIX MY LIFE BY RESUMING MY OWN PERSONAL INDIVIDUAL PATH IN LIFE AND CAREER IN LIFE. I just want to hear any advice from the internet, if anybody has any. \n\nThe way my drug use has made my life go wrong in a nutshell is:\n\nI have escaped from my own reality, and impaired my memory and memory function, for years, and have not faced who I am for years.\n\nThe thing that made me realise all of my mistakes in life, is responsible drug use though, I used Methcathinone (kind of like Cocaine, and Methamphetamine) which sharpened my mind, and makes me awake really. I feel like I am a better version of myself, since My memory is back, and I start to reflect on my past, I feel like exploring my life when on it.\n\nWhen I started using it regularly, about a year ago, My life started to gradually change. I started releasing more and more things about in life, and that I need to change. This is also the reason my relationship with my GF started declining, cus I started to realise she is a problematic person herself, since she has so many insecurities, wants to be a a victim in life, and wants to be always insure of herself and her life. She always wants to have a problem with something in life, and just let somebody fix it for her. She has basically led Me, and her BEST FRIEND FOREVER, to the same path with her- SOOOO TIRED OF HER, SINCE SHE SHARES HER PROBLEMS ALL THE TIME AND ALWAYS HAS A PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH.\n\nI have ruined my life by being with her, for the past 3 years really, even though the first 2 years were extremley romantic and nice, we had the relationship of a lifetime togheter so to say.  \n***But again, that was since I didnt have a life, and literally only cared for her, I had to give up my life so we were both happy.***\n\nAs of today, Her BFF, has basically told her this:  \nYou two arent for eachother. AT ALL.  \nWe have said our final farewell. For Ever.\n\nWhy? Since we were both problematic people, but ever since I realised this, I started drastically chaning everything, and **for a week, I had managed to change my life, more than I have ever managed the last 6 years. (thats how little I worked on myself)**\n\nShe though, for the last 6 months, has stayed the same, and has not changed at all.  \nWhich in turn has led to following the same problems she has HAD for the past like 10 years of her life.\n\nThose are: Making up random insecurities NON-STOP, Never knowing what she wants, Always wanting someone else to decide for her waht she wants from life, or somebody, Never knowing what she wants as a whole, Never knowing how to feel for herself, Never knowing what to do, Always bothering someone else for her problems, Not knowing what her problems are in the first place, and many more sadly.\n\nI just wanted to help her in the end, and be in a relationship sadly, I have been a very lonley person my whole life.\n\n**I have not really had any partner for 2 decades. I felt lonley. So I literally cut off my life and went into problematic relationships, just to feel with somebody.**\n\nI still have the need to be with somebody, and I regret that thing as a whole. That I am like this.\n\nMy memory has been extremley impaired due to my drug use the last 6 months. From the Dissociative, specifically. Nothing else I use impairs my memory really.\n\nIts like trying to be somebody, when drinking 3 litres of vodka every day(without dying), and never beeing in your own reality, there for you.\n\nThat combined with always being in your partners life and never being in your own life, has led to what I am today.\n\n***A person which has followed the same mistake for 4 years, and has always thought to get into university, but has failed, and attempted again, waiting for years, again and again, and having extreme mindblowingly large depression and anxiety for years, again and again, while never working on himself and not succeeding again and again.***\n\n***I am finally ready to work on my self. And will do it this time. Since I am literally another person now.***\n\nThank you for reading this. It means a lot. I feel like there is somebody for me by sharing it.\n\nThe world is a better place, due to people like you guys.People that want to help, and help others when they are in the need. Thank you so much for your time. I Literally wanna hug you as a thank you.\n\nAs a final note, I said already, this is not the whole story, but gives a kind of a nutshell, I cant really give a whole picture, there are many more problems that have also led to my problem so far, but I think its good to start seeking help from somewhere atleast.", "title": "Not following my own career for years.

So with the stress of all the immigration process, the new culture, language, and failures with girls - or the only girl that i really like better said - I was going down, down and down.\n\nAll of this plus I've never liked my body totally. I was too fat years ago, and didn't look good, then I started running and I became such a skinny that when I was in a group with the girl I liked and I asked 'what's the difference between fit and skinny?' she said I was skinny and the guy I invited to the group was fit (dumb question but i was learning english and still learning). Then started to work out, eat well and sleep well and didn't notice a good change plus I was spending such a good money in meat and good food and I was so tired cuz after work I help my parents in a cleaning job-all to don't really notice any good change in my body after 3/4 months (I did notice but not as I would've liked).\n\nSo I entered in a mindset of 'i cannot make it, nor she nor any other girl i like will even notice me, even if i work hard i won't get my business going, etc etc' and I was draining all my energy, stopped working out and started to overthink everything. I was feeling so depressed -i know i'm in a good position that many people would love to be, more even from my country but i got that kinda fire on me that if i am not going for what it's on my hearth i just feel so so so bad.\n\nToday I decided that was enough. I don't want to feel this way, and I won't become one of those people who just talks and dreams but never do. I won't be the person who admires hard working, fit and creative people and just be watching. I won't keep my dreams in my head, not me. Because as my grand pa said, I do not want to be one of those who just want and do not work hard, and I do not want to just imagine, I don't. I won't be that guy.\n\nI will stop putting excuses to myself, I will stop overthinking, and I will stop wondering.\n\nWhat if I lost everything? What if I have to go to my home country? What if I fail? What if I work so hard and I don't make it? What if I spend my next 10 years giving it all to at the end face a huge failure?\n\nWhat do you want? A guarantee paper? This is life and I can bet you the only guarantee I can give you is that if you don't try it and change from TODAY, from NOW you will regret it so SO bad. So better shut up and start working.\n\nAnd as you well know it, just do it, and keep doing it over and over, failure after failure, until you get it. Cuz you'll get it so just go for it.\n\nGo for your business.\n\nGo for your shredded body.\n\nGo for your youtube channel.\n\nGo for your dream girl.\n\nWork harder than ever, do not fear, and if you do, act as if you don't.\n\nWork without compassion and do it with confidence.\n\nBe smart as you are, but do not overthink.\n\nBe grateful and don't be dumb. You've got a beautiful family, good friends and many good opportunities.\n\nLearn everyday, never think you know it already.\n\nDo not allow those ideas of 'just few people can make it' stop you. That is a miserable way of thinking, and you are not miserable.\n\nDo all what is in your hand, with all your power, because there is no planning nor actions nor feelings in the grave.\n\nDo not be selfish. Help your family, help your sister, help those who you can help, maybe just a kind word, maybe just a call to remind them you care.\n\nSTOP OVERTHINKING.\n\nSoon or later you'll find a dope girl who sees all you effort, and she will love you so you will love her as well.\n\nSoon or later you will see the results of your effort, if you do not let your hands rest.\n\nYou got it? Cool. You haven't? I'm glad you are trying, so keep doing it, because as your grand pa said, 'many people want many things, but they do not want to work hard'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor my present me,\n\nTo the man I long to be.", "title": "I won't.

I really couldn't get them out of my head even with professional help so I decided that maybe getting back into contact would help me.

They have BPD and ED and I have some unhealthy narcissistic tendencies that come out when I feel extremely threatened. It's not a great combination belive me. While I don't think that they meant me any harm I do belive that their view on things is warped and they almost made me belive that everything they did was good and right while I was being manipulativ and unreasonable. I started communicating with phrases like \"I wish\" and \"I feel like\" and worked on my ability to see their point of view as they wished. And while that helped me improve my relationships with others things kept getting worse between my ex and me. At some point I realized that while I often made mistakes they were to one who pushed me to a point where I was just confused, angry and frustrated and then ended the phone call just to resort to texting. At that point they were really calm while I wasnt myself anymore. They then showed those texts to their therapist who said I was being toxic. And since my texts were indeed toxic my calm self belived that I was being the issue. I don't think they did it on purpose but I belive that it was their way to deal with feelings of insecurity or \"negative feelings\" in general. I ended the whole thing and got really drunk.

I'm 24(F), working in a 'fancy' senior role in a bank and I'm depressed out of my mind. I have been working full time (40+ hrs) since 19 after I dropped out of college. In the meantime, I jumped from one long term relationship to the other, literally 2 weeks apart. They were both toxic (I know everyone says that but mine genuinely were). I basically spent the last 6 years working full time and focusing on relationships that weren't working; not much time spent on me.\n\nFast forward to more recent events: lockdowns, ended my 3.5 year relationship in January of this year, family puppy put down last month, depression has been very difficult in the last year on and off, started in a new department while WFH, which I find very tough - the job is super exploitative so I don't see myself staying long, and yeah.. I'm just beyond miserable. I saved up for a car for most of last year and I thought that would solve all my problems! But now I've gained weight and going to random places just to buy something, anything, to fill a void. I have been having a major existential crisis now and crying almost every night before bed.\n\nMyself and the housemates were evicted and I was given a few months notice. I can't stick family longer than 3 days so living at home isn't an option. I've always rented with strangers but all my friends live with each other, no space for me. I have always wanted my own space. I have never called any place home because I just don't feel comfortable anywhere. I feel like an outsider constantly. I am happiest when I'm in the house alone where I can sing freely, play music, dance, cook for as long as I want, whenever I want. I'm a night owl so I'd like the freedom to just do whatever, whenever.\n\nSo, I want to move to Berlin. I have always wanted to move abroad and I feel like this year is the perfect year. I went there once when I was a teen and instantly fell in love. It feels like my kind of city and felt like home almost? I can't describe it. I've been to other cities like London, Barcelona, Paris and although they're lovely, I wouldn't want to live there. I want to move to Germany and be completely independent, away from everyone and just focus on me. Explore, travel, learn new languages, join a dance class, get back to piano, anything! I have done a lot of research in recent months; cost, rent, job opportunities, registration, the lot. The only issue is, I haven't told anyone that I'm doing this in the next few months. I mentioned it off hand to friends and they were 100% for it. However, I'm terrified of my mother's reaction because we drove hours to get this car and I plan on selling it - I simply don't need it for a pedestrianised city like Berlin. It's my first car, nothing like it around here, stunning little thing! But.. it's just a car. There will be other cars. It doesn't make me happy. I want to sell it, sell off anything else, quit my job and just move. I'll find a job once I settle in but the money I get from selling the car will last me 6-7 months, probably longer.\n\nHow do I tell my mother? I'm worried if I tell her, she won't want to talk to me ever again. I already disappointed her by dropping out and she will very likely feel betrayed. She always says don't quit a job when you have nothing lined up so when I quit mine, I'll disappoint her more. The family all live within a 15km radius and it feels quite suffocating if I'm being honest. We're all close but in more of a toxic way.

If there was one word I'd use to describe my life, I'd say the word \"juxtaposition\" works the best. I was treated with love from both parents and had a nice school life, but at home parent one is an alcoholic because of a bad past and always abused sibling one by calling her a slut, whore, bitch, etc since a young age and allowed for something to happen to them. I don't know what. She gaslighted me into hating my other parents for 5 years of my youth. I thought they were the enemy because she always told me that. They (parent two) aren't innocent either, but they are way better than parent one. They never lie, but parent one does.\n\nFor some reason, parent one never harmed me and gave me lots of love. They gaslighted me into thinking my sibling was the bad guy too, and it took me 9 years to realize that. I'm not allowed to be neutral or on anybody's side except parent one's because they think everybody's out to get them and that we are planning to kill her (I am not lying). Everytime I told them to apologize to somebody for wronging them, she gets defensive, gaslights, and victim blames, and it's semi hard to communicate with a language barrier.\n\nThey literally can't see how they are wrong. Parent one uses their illnesses as an excuse not to talk too. I'm starting to think it was parent one's fault sibling one fell into drugs, sex, etc since 15 years old. I grew up with everybody yelling, and then claiming it was \"communication\", but luckily I knew better. I'm grateful I wasn't abused by a bully of a parent, but I don't know how to improve being so defensive and angry so quickly. It's been instilled inside of me. I can't get therapy because I'll get in trouble for it.\n\nMy family is very messed up, and I'm always left in the dark. I'm tired of the abuse and fighting. I don't know how to improve myself y'all.

I spend all of my time inside my head, calling myself out on every single thing I do. 70% of my waking time is spent in complete anxiety, dissecting every single thing I think and the motivations behind it.

Because you will get STRONG urges to:  \n\n\n* Interrupt.\n* Give advice.\n* Share your experience.\n* Jump to the other topic. \n\nIt's completely normal. It's human nature. But you don't do these things. You focus, ask what happened, reflect feelings and nod.\n\n**Example:** your gf/bf/roommate comes pissed from work.\n\nYOU: what happened?\n\nGF: my boss shouted at me.\n\nNOW y*ou observe YOUR URGES:*  \n\n\n* *anger: \"I told you to be more assertive with that dumbass!\";*\n* *problem solving, anger: \"I'll call him and get this fixed in a half an hour\";*\n* *pity: \"Oh, poor you. I'm very sorry dear. He's a bad man and he's just hurting you so so bad. Truly an awful situation\"*\n* *one upping: \"Tell me about it! I remember the time MY boss was the asshole\"*\n* *self talk: \"Yeah, it's tough, but you haven't yet seen what happened today to my minecraft server...\"*\n* *problem solving: \"right, you need to quit this job. This is what we're going to do. I will hire fiverr guy for the the CV, then we'll print them and then...\"*\n* *and so on...*\n\nWhat these responses do is set you further apart. So what you actually do is take a deep breath, notice the URGES and then say:   \n\n\n* Yikes, sound like a tough day. Can you tell me more about it? \n* GF: yeah I was having lunch and then he came and got pissed about that report I just wrote. Then that another thing.. And another and blah blah blah\n* YOU: *nodding like mad*\n* GF: And then there was that and that and that. \n* YOU: *still nodding*\n* GF: and after that, there was this thing...\n* YOU: I can see you're angry at him\n* GF: no shit, Sherlock!  He's the biggest asshole there is. \n* YOU: \\[could take this Sherlock thing personally, but you don't cause it's her anger talking so you acknowledge it\\] yeah, angry you are indeed. What happened next?\n* so on... \n\nI know it all might seem like a common knowledge for some of you, but people generally don't listen very well. For example I thought I was the best listener in the world before learning what the listening actually is. And it's not only my suicidal country, I also lived in the UK for a few years, spent a year in the US and it's all the same - people just don't seem to listen that well. The response is usually ridden with advice and a need to solve the problem.\n\n**Why I wanted to flair this post as HELP?**\n\nBecause I need to understand **why people don't learn these skills?** I saw some courses online that teach active listening, but they seem subpar. In general this industry seems half-dead. I couldn't even find a blog on the topic!!\n\nCountless coachers teach public speaking, leadership, emotional intelligence. **Where is active listening??** Am I missing something? Please help me understand. Has it ever came across your mind that it's a good skill to have?

I wanted to share the journey I've been on, especially as it's one that **started right here on Reddit**, by getting feedback from 50+ different chronic illness subreddits! \n\n\\------------ \n\nLike many people with chronic conditions, I discovered I\u2019m often misunderstood, misdiagnosed and not given enough support by medical professionals. In fact, in the UK, a quarter of people with long-term conditions aged 18 to 34 report not having enough support from local healthcare services.\n\nEven more concerning is these numbers don\u2019t take into account the people who have yet to be diagnosed with a chronic condition. And we know how much of a struggle that can be.\n\nI know all too well the frustration of coming out of an appointment with my doctor or therapist knowing I hadn\u2019t been able to give them a clear picture of my health. This is unsurprisingly a common problem. Especially when you consider the cognitive symptoms that are common among many mental and physical health conditions. This often leads to no diagnosis, a very tentative diagnosis or at worst, a misdiagnosis.\n\nI know all too well the frustration of coming out of an appointment with my doctor or therapist knowing I hadn\u2019t been able to give them a clear picture of my health. This is unsurprisingly a common problem. Especially when you consider the cognitive symptoms that are common among many mental and physical health conditions. This often leads to no diagnosis, a very tentative diagnosis or at worst, a misdiagnosis.\n\nMy personal experience was a wild goose chase, going from consultant to consultant in search of answers. This was in addition to the hours spent on Google or exploring chronic condition communities on Reddit to try and self-diagnose what my doctors could not.\n\nAfter years of seeking answers, I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. So, I started tracking my mood, symptoms and other daily activities, in the hope it would help me to understand and feel more in control of my health.\n\nOn the bad days, many don\u2019t have much energy to do anything at all. So, I created a simple one-click rating method for my mood and symptoms using a spreadsheet with the option to add a note if I felt up to it.\n\nThis simple process not only helped me to provide medical professionals with a clearer picture of my health but it had a few unexpected benefits:\n\n**1. It was therapeutic.**\n\nJournaling made me feel like a weight was being removed, almost as if I was sharing the burden of emotions I had attached to the day\u2019s issues and events.\n\n**2. It gave me purpose.**\n\nMaking journaling a daily habit gave me some sense of purpose, especially on the days I was unable to do much else. I always felt like I had done one positive thing for the day.\n\n**3. It gave me perspective.**\n\nWhen you are having a bad day, it\u2019s easy to get caught in the moment worrying you will always feel that way. I know my brain is also more likely to remember the bad days. Journaling provided a sense of perspective and helped me realize I had a lot more good days than I first thought.\n\nAfter a while, I was able to step back and think of those difficult moments as just colored blobs of information amongst hundreds of other journal entries. I found I was much less likely to get stuck in the moment and spiral into anxiety. I was also more confident those moments would pass, as they had done before. The more information I collected, the more I felt a sense of control over my health.\n\nIn the end, tracking everything in a spreadsheet turned out to be less convenient than I\u2019d hoped. I looked for apps as a solution, but found they were either too specific or not specific enough. They all failed to give me the quality of insights I was getting from my spreadsheets.\n\nIn 2019, I was forced to quit my dream job because of my chronic conditions. So, I set out to build an app for people like me. Something people could use on the go, that recognized the importance of the connection between the mind and body.\n\nI wanted somewhere people could keep their mood and symptom entries in one place, along with other health factors such as sleep, diet, exercise, medication, supplements, etc. Knowing how these factors all impact one another, it made no sense to me why people had to keep this information spread across more than one app.\n\nUltimately, I wanted to build something that could be as simple or as complex as a person needed it to be. I wanted it to be as unique as every person\u2019s individual experience of living with chronic conditions.\n\nA year ago I launched my app, which I designed and self-funded. An app that was built with the support, feedback and advice of the online chronic condition community (**here on Reddit!**) that helped me years earlier.\n\nToday, we\u2019ve had over 100,000 users and still work with the community to make it even better suited to people\u2019s niche health needs. Whilst we still have a long way to go, the positive reviews I see from our users remind me why I began this journey.

I am desperate for some support/advice on how to approach this very strange issue of mine. (21m)\n\nTo preface this let's go back to high school and college as I believe it might be relevant to explain how it began. I wasn\u2019t the smartest kid then but I think a lot of that came from having a very poor work ethic &amp; caring about video games more than anything. I still managed to get into college (a lot of cheating contributed to this) &amp; did 4 years of varsity sports. During all of that I didn\u2019t really have many irl friends, but I found a friend group towards the end and am still friends with a couple of the dudes that I met back then. They\u2019re really good lads doing well now.\n\nIn college I decided I was going to strap the fuck down &amp; go all out on my studies. In the beginning of the first semester, my roommates would always think they were annoying me, I didn\u2019t care about being friends with them, etc. for just caring too much about school. Eventually I started to open up to them and this large friend group and started cheating on all of my assignments and exams again. I should mention at this point my whole life I felt \u201cstrange\u201d around other people, especially those I didn\u2019t know and during high school/college I had social anxiety. A lot of those college friends saw me as a little different but I was still \u201ccool\u201d enough to hang out &amp; room with them for 3 years. In my third year I convinced myself I had ADHD (which I possibly still might) and began heavily abusing my stimulant medication and weed. Funny enough, this is when I felt the \u201csmartest\u201d &amp; most \u201csocially capable\u201d in my life even those a lot of this can be attributed to chasing the adderall high.\n\nThen COVID started &amp; this is where the fun begins. When I returned home I quickly realized how disgusting my adderall abuse and habits became. Quitting those drugs sent me into depression &amp; I started having problems. I couldn\u2019t care less about school, I started having cognitive issues, anhedonia, &amp; started isolating myself. After trying several antidepressants and experiencing derealization &amp; depersonalization I started to obsess about my problems. I have been literally going on reddit every single day for HOURS for the past 5 fucking months trying to learn what the fuck is wrong with me by reading through people personal stories with mental illness, every single psychiatric medication I could possibly put on, &amp; what I could possibly do to help myself. Moreover I didn\u2019t realize at the time what I was doing would screw me over so hard. Through this I developed very deep &amp; profound self-loathing thoughts analyzing everything bad that has happened to me in my life and completely ignoring the good I have accomplished and what I am capable of. Now I am completely trapped in this cyclical thinking of \u201cI am so fucked\u201d \u201cI will never be normal\u201d \u201cHow the are people normal\u201d \u201cWhat happened to me\u201d \u201cI am going insane\u201d \u201cI will never get out of this nightmare\u201d literally OVER and OVER again. I think about ABSOLUTELY nothing else and this is not an understatement. I am stuck in my head 24/7 unaware of what is going on around me &amp; life is just going by. I can\u2019t have a conversation anymore with my family members, &amp; have become extremely self conscious of every single thing I say. I just started working at a restaurant in order to keep my mind of things. It doesn\u2019t help. I am a MUTE at work and respond to things in one word or one-sentences that people often do not know how to respond to.. The meds I take do not work. They make me tired and the rumination doesn\u2019t stop. It will not fucking stop. Because of this I am suicidal. I do not know a way out of this. I try meditating, exercising, positive affirmations, and nothing helps. I\u2019ve lost my friends, my hobbies, theres no pleasure in life, &amp; I am quite very much delusional. I take full responsibility for what has happened to me. Theres nobody to blame but myself. I just don\u2019t know what steps I need to take to become a normal member of society and think like one. I guess a big reason why I am posting this here because throughout the months of digging through here I haven\u2019t been able to find a single person who has gone through something like this, but there is a very small chance that somebody might know/have advice on what to do to get my thinking straight &amp; the steps I need to take to recover my life. I understand it will be a long process, but I just need to be confident that what I am doing will heal me. If anybody out there can help out there, please speak up.

In fact, there isn\u2019t a person on earth who isn\u2019t insecure about something.\n\nThough physical appearance, monetary wealth or mental well-being can all play parts in dictating the severity of these insecurities, the key difference between a person who allows their insecurities to swallow them whole and a person who is generally self-assured is the methods in which each one manages them.\n\n**2. Instead of focussing purely on repressing the way you react to your insecurities, start considering the causes of them**\n\nMany people write off emotional reactions to their insecurities as simple anger management issues.\n\nIf you wish to prevent insecurities from having a debilitating impact on your life, you need to look beyond your emotional reactions to them, and instead, understand the root causes.\n\nRepressing your reaction to insecurity is a band-aid solution.\n\nIdentifying the source of your issue is the first step on the path to better self-assurance.\n\n**3. Seek counsel**\n\nIn order to help you understand the sources of your insecurities and look for ways to work through them, you may need to seek external counsel.\n\nSome of the best people to speak to about them include healthcare professionals, close family members and emotionally intelligent friends.\n\nOr, if you'd prefer to speak about them more anonymously to begin with, you can chat with like-minded individuals on Internet forums.

Learn to accept that which is out of your control**\n\nMany people are insecure about something that is beyond their control, such as their height or their IQ.\n\nThe moment you can learn to accept that no amount of anger, resentment or bitterness will magically make you taller or smarter is the moment you can begin to live your life in a more carefree manner.\n\nOftentimes the traits you are insecure about aren\u2019t what hold you back, but rather your attitude towards them and your inability to accept them.\n\n**5. Recall your successes**\n\nInsecurities have a nasty habit of making you forget about your past successes and focus instead on your past failures.\n\nIf you can remember this during moments of weakness, it can help you to objectively realise that you're a lot more capable and talented than your insecurities are allowing you to believe.\n\n**6. Own up to them, thus removing the stigma for others**\n\nThe most admirable way to deal with your insecurities is by being honest about them.\n\nIf everyone had the strength and courage to do this, the ridiculous stigma which suggests that insecurities are signs of weakness would quickly be lost.\n\nPlus, let\u2019s be honest, if insecurities really are signs of weakness, then every person on earth is weak.\n\nDisclaimer: If your insecurities are truly destroying your self-esteem right now, then this may not be the best solution for you just yet.\n\n**7. Self-improve**\n\nSelf-improvement is another effective method for dealing with insecurities, be it through self-development, physical development or by channelling your insecure energy into something productive.\n\nSelf-improvement in other areas of your life will help you build the self-confidence necessary to leave you feeling silly about that which you were insecure about in the first place.\n\n**8. Know that those who purposely look to make you feel insecure are among the most insecure people of all**\n\nThere are certain people who will always go out of their way to try and bring you down. This can leave you feeling particularly insecure, which is ironic, because no-one is more insecure than a person who purposely looks to surface up insecurities in others.\n\nRealising this will help you to put things into perspective when you identify a situation in which someone is purposely doing this to you.", "title": "8 healthy ways to deal with your insecurities"}, {"created_utc": 1617841477, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmfttv/my_selfworth_is_contingent_on_my_appearance_how/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "Title.

I had landed a dream job at 24, making a ton of money. My girlfriend of a year and friend since 14 had just moved in with me in a luxurious loft downtown, a five minute walk from work. I was motivated, to work hard and play hard. I had lots of hobbies - I worked on and raced a couple cars. I bought a motorcycle, I traveled, I worked on computers, I had a lot of random projects, and I was on track to skyrocket my career forward. \n\nThen about 16 months ago I started playing wow again. Casually at first, then I started raiding. It was a game Ive played since I was 10, off and on, but never more than a couple weeks at a time, and only ever casually. At this point one of my hobbies became mixing drinks. Making cocktails, going to cocktail bars, getting fancy with things. I'd go out with a coworker often and come home plastered. I started playing WoW more and abandoning my other hobbies. One colleague also died in a car crash, which also led to the abandonment of my main hobby, racing. At this point I was playing WoW all night. \n\nOnce I moved out into the suburbs with my then girlfriend about 14 months ago, my behavior only got worse. Not only were the suburbs a complete 180 from the social life I was living downtown, but then covid hit. I started playing wow during work. 2-3 drinks a night. My girlfriend kept trying to tell me to get it together, but quickly moved out a year ago and became my ex. \n\nSince then I doubled down on my behavior, playing WoW upwards of 15 hours a day and ignoring everything else. Doing anything productive felt impossible because it was taking away time from WoW. I started drinking at 5pm, stumbling to bed at 2am, and barely waking up for work and wow the next day. I told myself it was helping me forget the heartbreak, that it was all just a coping mechanism. She would still see me on the weekends, where I'd do my best to be presentable, but it was hard to hide my unhappiness and resentment, and there was constant friction and crying. After she left I would immediately fall back into my old ways. \n\nThis last sunday we decided to go out for drinks. She was driving and told me to indulge myself. The next morning, the last thing I remember of that night was her crying across the table. I went and threw up. Later I got a long message from her telling me she can't handle this, and she needed a break from talking to me. \n\nI realized I can't keep living like this - treating myself and her this way. Later monday I moved all the liquor in the house into my upstairs closet. I cancelled my WoW subscription and haven't logged on. I have so much extra free time now that its hard to NOT use it on productive things. I'm not waking up hungover. I start a class at community college tomorrow. Luckily I still have my job, but its not the role it was when I started and I've been unhappy in it for a while, so I started applying for new jobs.

I threatened her with suicide (that wasn't the last time I did it). Even though she was clearly not interested in me, I would ask her to be my girlfriend again over and over.

Called her mother to check on her and 2. Sent an \"apology\" by a friend. Supposedly, I was \"feeling way better and therefore wouldn't guilt trip her again\". That was a lie.

This is the mindset that got me this far.\n\nHowever, I don't know how to hold myself accountable for mistakes in interpersonal relationships (beyond apologies), so I will share recent learnings and what I realized I did wrong after lots of thinking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. Mindfulness.** Stop. Think. Breathe. Ask yourself questions in your head to avoid shutting down and succumbing to pressure or intimidation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Being assertive** and communicating is important. State your thoughts, feelings, and needs as facts.\n\n* **My Wrongdoing:** I angrily lashed out at my partner. As the relationship progressed, we shared many \u201cI love you's\" and intimate chats. Once she suddenly told me she didn't see me as her partner, I felt used and hurt hours later. I angrily lashed out at her with a long message. When the relationship ended yesterday, I also passive-aggressively criticized her by bringing up her previous misfortunes, while I vented in a post under the guise of advice. That was very awful and mean to do. I should have been assertive in both situations instead. Being assertive is much healthier, especially for communication, and you can learn about someone by noting how they respond to assertiveness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. People are like clothes: unique,** and one size doesn't fit all. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. The** ***\"What Did\u2019s\"*** matter more than the ***\"What If\u2019s\"*** when your emotional health is involved.\n\n* **My Wrongdoing:** I took the What If\u2019s and labeled her with them. Feeling I've been mistreated and neglected is perfectly acceptable. Feeling like my trust was broken is perfectly acceptable. What isn't acceptable is labeling someone with the What If\u2019s. My thoughts and feelings are acceptable, but they become bad What Did\u2019s when they\u2019re aggressively used to smear. Be assertive. Leaving a relationship, based on the What Did\u2019s, is more mature and reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. The small, everyday moments** make up a beautiful life. Carry out your interactions with significance and appreciate the little things around you. It will make life less gray. I learned that from her! I think this works, regardless of one\u2019s situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6. Communicate your needs in relationships.** If one person does not feel like a relationship meets their needs, it's okay to leave.\n\n* **My Wrongdoing:** Same as #2. If I communicate my needs, and my partner says that they can't meet them, then it's not healthy for me to stay in that relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7. Lives are too complex to be fairly compared.** A myriad of detailed circumstances, experiences, and upbringings led you to the present moment, and you're the only person that's read all of the pages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**8. Don't rush to extreme assumptions** about people in your life. Slow down. \n\n* **My Wrongdoing:** When I researched relationship experiences while currently having them, I would read the signs as exact facts. Typically, I\u2019d conclude this from *one day\u2019s* worth of interaction\u2026 which isn\u2019t good. I completely admit that I felt incredibly uncomfortable when my descriptions and experiences were listed in numerous threads and articles, but even then, it isn\u2019t fair to factually conclude things from them. She\u2019s just as capable of having bad days as I am. Be assertive, stick to the \u201cWhat Did\u2019s,\u201d and communicate instead! If they don\u2019t want to meet you halfway on your communication needs, then there are other relationships that can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**9. Put yourself first.** No one else can bathe, think, eat, study, or breathe for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10. You can't change other people,** whether your intentions are good (helping someone lose weight) or not (\u201cYou must think this way\u201d). They can't change you, either.\n\n* **My Wrongdoing:** I tried to persuade her that she had a Dismissive-Avoidant attachment issue we *had* to fix, because my needs weren't being met in the relationship. I never felt like a priority to her, and was upset when my assertive communication about that was dismissed, but I still did a mean thing by trying to \u201cfix\" her, therefore I didn't respect her autonomy. You can suggest things to people, but what I did was wrong. Be with someone that meets your needs instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s all. I still feel guilty, but also disregarded and heartbroken. I do miss the good times in the relationship, but *not* the bad. It is okay to feel those things. I don't know if she wants to hear from me again, so I haven't decided on a direct apology, but sharing the bad things I did with the internet is an *okay-ish* extra.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won't paint her or myself in black and white again like before (*assertiveness!*), but I believe it's important to communicate my faults and declare when I've done a bad thing, even if I feel unfairly treated. Doing it always makes me emotionally uncomfortable, but I know it's important to me. If I\u2019m unwilling to admit when I\u2019m wrong by my own initiative, then I will never see the ways that I can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's a good value I got from childhood trauma! I just need to be cautious about repeating the behavior I\u2019m unlearning from it (like not standing up for myself).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.

Initially, thought this was because of early mornings, but I have had the same issue if I have to be somewhere at 8am, 12pm or 3pm. I do have early shifts and find I actually enjoy mornings bc they\u2019re quiet and I feel like I\u2019ve accomplished so much by midday. They\u2019ve somewhat lost their allure in the dark winter and quarantine.  \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to articulate\u2014 I feel like my brain is in a whole other realm when I wake. It\u2019s a tug of war between the want to be better and the comfort of avoidance. It seems like the most simple thing to me when I am feeling lucid, but far from it when time comes to actually doing it. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever had so much trouble with anything else in my life.\n\n**Why I do it (I think):**\n\n* I didn\u2019t grow up with any particular sleep routine to be honest. Only was forced out of bed for school, church or anything else my parents deemed important. I would stay up as late as I wanted if I said it was for school. Otherwise, I would stay in bed as long as possible. As I got older, my parents had less control over me and I stayed in bed more. \n* I wasn\u2019t exactly raised to self motivate or think for myself. I grew up with a pretty overbearing parent who often used comparison and disappointing others as reasons for action. Now that i have much more control over my life, I\u2019m frustrated that I\u2019m not finding success fixing any shortcomings from my upbringing.\n* I did not grow up with proper time management. It\u2019s rampant though my household and my personal responsibilities. finding sneaky ways to lie to myself to enable procrastination is also a thing for me. \n* I am depressed or recovering from depression not really sure what to call it but whatever. Sleeping/ chilling in bed longer (like a whole day or days at a time) is typical of my episodes. I have suspected I had adhd in the past year, but my doc didn\u2019t seem too into the idea of that rabbit hole. She dismissed it so I gathered I might\u2019ve just used the internet for confirmation bias? I dunno if it is worth pursuing. \n* One of my vices is escapism via sleep. I\u2019m 27 now, I think I realized I was doing this around 24-25. When I\u2019m not particularly in a depressive state, I find it hard to even break the habit I maintained while depressed. \n* I could be avoiding parts of life I don\u2019t want but I\u2019ve even had this be an issue for things I\u2019m excited to do. \n* i always feel tired and/ or low energy. I\u2019m assuming this is because of a lack of quality sleep. \n\n**Resources I have tried:** \n\n* Advice from my therapist: make a schedule/ plan (waking me just shuffles tasks later in the day or or gored tasks and gives up when it\u2019s too late), meditation before bed and waking up\n* Advice from my doctor: practicing sleep hygiene, avoiding caffeine \n* Advice from internet: take melatonin; use motivation from nice toiletries, food, etc to excite you to get out of bed\n* spoke to friends, nobody can really relate. they do encourage me when I talk about it, but I pretty much have the same disappointing news when they ask. \n\n**Things that have helped in the past, but not consistently and/or don\u2019t help anymore:**\n\n* Cutting down (or out) alcohol and pot. I find the former makes me anxious for a few days, the latter makes me sleep more/ more lazy. I avoid avoid it for the most part (specifically because of this) but admittedly have used either/ both after downplaying their impacts. I don\u2019t recognize it\u2019s happening until it\u2019s happening or after I emerge from the post substance fog. \n* Mediation\u2014 helps with being aware of thoughts \n* Knowing (external) repercussions \u2014 letting people down, losing job, it\u2019s officially last minute, note: its effect on me (ex: my health, my self esteem, $ wasted on last minute ubers to make up for lost time) don\u2019t seem to be enough of a repercussion for me. \n* Light alarm/ timed light/ loud alarm/ fading or soft sounding alarm\u2014 I snooze and go back tiger until absolute last min. Or just sleep with the light on (I can sleep in almost any setting tbh). \n* Exercise in the evenings\u2014 it seems to be the only time I\u2019ll actually do it so I went with it. Having a place to be a tu I\u2019ve in the gym helped with my motivation, but COVID. I\u2019m back to square one on that front now. \n* I sleep while listening to things. I live in a hectic household, so I\u2019ll put on a documentary or podcast or something to focus on. This sometimes leads to me browsing on my phone/ being distracted. \n* Sleeping masks definitely helped with sleep hygiene, but the getting out of bed problem persisted \n* Changing my environment: I\u2019m actually house sitting at the moment and am even more frustrated bc I\u2019m having the same issue even outside my household. It has worked in past when I don\u2019t want to expose my sleep Habits to someone else. \n* putting a clock/ alarm far away\u2014 I get up and turn it off or snooze and go back to bed\n* having someone call me\u2014 I answer and sound alive so they\u2019re impressed and then I go back to sleep\n* Drinking water first thing in the morning \n* Using a bring/ seasonal effective disorder lamp (yes, I\u2019ve even fallen asleep with one of them in my face wtf)\n\nDoes this seem like a discipline or motivation thing? Maybe I\u2019m suck in a victim/ non proactive/ lazy mentality? A brain thing? I\u2019m honestly at a loss. I\u2019ve found my morning self going SO far to undermine all the effort my lucid self puts in to set up an easier time leaving my bed. \n\nI sometimes think I am over complicating a simple part of everyday life and it\u2019s just a matter of \u201cdoing it\u201d. The problem is, why haven\u2019t I then??? And why have I been consciously struggling with it for so long? \n\n**\\*\\*where I think I could tangibly improve but maybe need a kick in the ass to do so?\\*\\***\n\nI have noticed in quarantine is that I\u2019ll wake up hours before I\u2019m supposed to be/ or wanted to be awake (3-4 am, planned for 7 or 6-7am, but planned for 9) and I feel somewhat in my right mind. i\u2019ll go back to sleep to get the extra sleep or without even looking at the time because it\u2019s still dark out. From there, I\u2019ll start another sleep cycle until 1, 2, 3 pm. Then I\u2019ll wake up late, feel stupid and then just stay in bed defeated. Or will maybe get out but feel bad the rest of the day. \n\nIf I do wake up shortly before when I\u2019m supposed to be up, I\u2019ll chill in bed or get distracted somehow (admittedly with my phone) and then fall asleep again. I thought about j just starting my day at whatever time I wake up. But again, enforcing something just \u201cfor me\u201d hasn\u2019t been successful for me much. I often go back to sleep telling myself I don\u2019t NEED to be up for any responsibilities and abandon any want for a functional schedule.\n\nI\u2019m desperate for anything at this point. If you read any of the above, THANKS.

I am 27 (M) she is 28 (F).\n\nMy ex and I were together for 6 years. I became very close with her family and siblings. Constantly going over to their houses for family events, dinners, and doing double dates with her siblings and their partners. Each week we made sure to go on a date forsure and spent many other days throughout our entire relationship. My ex and I were best friends, she doesnt have any friends. We took trips each year together, we got 2 animals together, we lived together for 4 years together. I would always do romantic gestures like leaving things on her car after work, or flowers randomly, or bath and spa nights. I put her on a pedastal and did my best to make her feel truly loved. \n\nWe never fought and honestly barely had any arguments about things. Thats how well we fit together. Similarly we had many of the same interests and even tried each others interest. I was there for her through tough times when both of her grandparents tragically passed away. I was an usher to walk the caskets down, which can tell you how close I was to her family. Each year I went with her family on family trips. \n\nFurther, we had similar values. We both didnt smoke, didnt do drugs, highly valued our religion that we share and had many similar world views and values for relationships. We valued each other enough to stay in communication every day no matter what by texting or talking. When we lived together, it was never an issue with cleanliness, cooking, etc. We both did our part and never expected the other to have to do such. We had similar future goals and dreams (travel, marriage, family, living on a lake, etc.) \n\nI can continue, but lets just say that we both felt very happy and in love together. We both expressed this daily. I never lied to her, I never cheated on her, I never did many things that would hurt someone outright. Further, I always tried to support her with her trauma and her own issues.\n\nNow for what happened:\n\nMy ex has a trauma history from her past 2 relationships. Abuse and lying. Neither relationship lasted more then 6 months. This happened when she moved away for college before she met me. She mentioned it to me, and told me how she can find it difficult to trust at times because of this. I always remembered this and made sure to never do anything sexual when we drank because I didnt want her to feel any negative way regarding that. As well, I consistently tried to build that trust and never hurt that trust until this last year.\n\nShe grew up homeschooled with all of her siblings in a strict household ran by her narcissistic and autistic father. For example, living at home at 28 she still has a curfew otherwise her dad yells at her. She fears her parents and wanta to make them happy and proud, seeking validation by doing right constantly. An example of this was when she started college it was for a career they suggested. Being in this environment, she has social anxiety and thus has 0 friends. All the years I was with her she made 3 friends and cut them out within 2-3 hangouts. \n\nMy ex was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and that was before we met. Those things all but went away or here I thought the first 5 years.\n\nSo no issues for 5 years, 6th year we have 3 things happen. I was planning to get engaged in 2021. As well, after college (end of 2019) we both moved back to our parents houses as we searched for our first jobs post college. Covid began, making it hard.\n\nFirst thing:\n\nMy ex and I go to my cabin. She gets on an ATV with my cousin, I make sure they both have helmets and I tell my younger cousin she needs to drive very responsibly because my girlfriend was on it. She said thats okay and I even told my ex if she would rather drive with me she can, yet she was alright going with my cousin. \n\n15 minutes later they are involved in a head on collison with a truck going around a very sharp turn at like 15 miles per hour. I was following them in my car and I was behind them by like a few hundred yards so I didnt see it happen due to the curve. Anyways I ran to my exes side. Held and compressed her leg as she was bleeding. Fast forward, I followed to the hospital and went into her room and waited the whole time with her. She was able to leave within 2 hours and had a tear in her muscle behind her knee, as well as a traumatic brain injury, and further a deviated septum.\n\nWe go back to my cabin, and I pretty much take care of my ex the next 24 hours til we leave for home. I helped her bathe, get dressed, made meals, grabbed ice or heat stuff, and even tried cheering her up by watching comedies she likes. \n\nAfter dinner my aunt (mother to my cousin) asked me for help. I asked what for and she explained to me that my cousin didnt finish her test to drive the ATV before we left. I told her that I feel uncomfortable doing that and so I opted out. An hour later she asks me again but now tells me that if I dont that the state could sue my grandparents. My grandparents live month to month on their retirement and social security, thus I felt obligated. Later I found out they had insurance and that she was manipulating me. However in this moment my ex felt like I broke her trust by taking this test that I felt obligated to take. She felt like I intentionally set out to cover it up that my cousin should not have been driving. I see where she is coming from but also I felt pressured into it by my aunt and I explained this to her but she said it hurts her still and her trust was broken. I apologized by writing her a letter explaining how I never intentionally meant for that.\n\nNow fast forward 2 months, my ex is still healing and I bring up possibly going to my cabin for a holiday and asking if she wanted to go. She said absolutely not, because my uncle and cousin may be there. I said I understand but this worried me because I was thinking about our future and how it would work regarding family occasions. I brought this up to her and we had a disagreement about it. I asked if they could come to a future wedding of ours, or if we held a family holiday would they be able to come? To which she said again absolutely not. I expressed how I felt about this considering this uncle was the one I was closest to. I said do you think in time your feelings will change? And she said no because of the permanent damage she felt from the accident. Then she brought up covering up for my cousin and that I should never speak to them again because of the pain they put her through via the accident and trust breaking. I took about a week to consider everything. During this time she thought and convinced herself I was choosing them over her BECAUSE I was arguing with her about them being in my life for future events. My family members also never reached out past the first week following the accident and she felt hurt by this. Yet, I reached out constantly and was supporting her healing process. I even wrote to her parents my apology for the damage she had been dealt. Unfortunately I will touch upon this later but her dad banished me from their house and family events.\n\nI blocked my cousin, aunt, and uncle and sent them a long message regarding everything. Up to this point 2 months after the accident I had not spoken to them, and had been supporting my ex's healing progress. So not only did I not speak to them, but I blocked them and wrote what they did wrong and how it was not acceptable. Thus in this moment choosing her over my family members. She came back at the end of that week despite all of this and said my actions showed I chose my family over her and she felt very hurt by this. She said my actions to argue against her for people who hurt her was clear to her how I felt. These arguments were never yelling or anything, it was simply me asking if they would be able to be at certain events and my reasoning why I would appreciate them there. And even after me making my actions clear about not speaking to them since, and blocking them, she still felt betrayed because as she said, \"my actions are clear and you chose them over me.\"\n\nWell we dropped this topic moving forward because she was focusing on healing and I blocked them. Yet she still seemed hurt. Now her father is a great person, yet he is strict and he has autism. She never shared with her parents all the details. Simply the details of the accident. Before the accident I was at her house 2/7 days in a week I would say because that way my ex and I could see each other because she liked being at home. Then 2/7 days at my house. And 1 of those 4 days we would do a full date all day or all night. Anyways, since the accident her father grew very resentful to me. Despite my apology in writing, and even in person. He would argue with my ex that she needed to break up with me and that I was not a good person because I let her get on a dangerous machine. Mind you my ex is 27 and I am not controlling thus I did what I could by warning my cousin to be safe and giving them helmets. So her father blamed me, and he told I am not allowed over to their house. So now, my ex and I only saw each other at my house and less. Even so, my ex told me that she had to lie to her father where she was going because he would consistently yell at her to break up with me because I am not a good person for letting her get hurt.\n\nFast forward 3 more months, were still doing weekly dates and still having sex frequently. We are getting into a better place as we close into graduating. At this time, we were at our parents doing internships. I still am not allowed over and she is even having me pick her up a street over because she did not want her dad to see when we would spend time together. This was hard for me but I never argued about it and just understood despite how bad I felt that her dad hated me when I didnt cause the accident. We are spending less time together because of her father on her back, and because she doesnt prefer to always come to my house (I have smokers in the house and she hates the smell, as do I but I need to deal with it until I could move out again) i would always spray and light candles to make it better.\n\nEvent 2:\n\nNow another month forward we are now into the beginning of 2020, we find out that we are unexpectedly pregnant. We used birth control but it must have failed. She brings out the test and as I wait I am smiling thinking about everything. When she brings them both out they are both positive I hug her and then I begin to have a panic attack. Let me make an important note here, I have an anxiety disorder which she knew about. My panic is breathing heavy, heart racing, face likely looking panicked, and intrusive thoughts. These thoughts began to come out, as I explained to her this: \"I am so grateful and happy for this. I am worried though because neither of us have jobs, we are living at our parents and you dont want to live with me because of your parents, as well your parents are going to be mad at me even more then they were with the accident.\" She begins to cry, and tells me this is suppose to be a happy moment. I tell her I agree 100%, and I am happy, but we are going to need to figure some things out so that we stay happy. I dont want her and I to struggle financially in any way, I grew up poor and thats why I push myself to work and find a career. She agrees but still seems really sad. \n\nI see her about a week later and she begins telling me we need to go to her therapist. I ask why and she says we need to make a big decision. Continuing I ask whats that. She said we have 3 options, keep our baby, give our baby up for adoption, or abortion. I tell her thats okay and we go to her therapist. During this session she breaks down crying because she is worried about everything, she speaks for atleast have of the session about her parents and why she is worried they will disown her, and why she is worried about their opinion about premarital sex and a baby our of marriage. We leave with the therapist telling us to come back in a week with pros and cons for each option. \n\nAfter seeing her cry and worry, I spent the next month looking for work 8 hours a day. Yet it was covid layoffs happening and so I couldnt find squat. Anyways, a week later I bring my pros, my cons, as does she. I preface the talk with saying I want to keep our baby, I have been looking for work, and I dont want her parents to be a reason why we choose something like this. Then I also say I will continue to step up.\nWe give our pros and cons for each and hers are mostly focused on her parents and the lack of financial security. I understand and we talk about the options in therapy.\n\nAnother week and at this point we are going together to all of the doctors appointments. She talks to me and asks me what do I want to do? I tell her she seems pretty set on abortion based on our talk in therapy, that I want to keep our baby, but if not then I still want children in our future. She tells me she is leaning on abortion, and I tell her I will have to support this decision.\n\nFinally she and I go to a doctors appointment and the whole time I am nervous because the night before I was highly debating buying an engagement ring and proposing to her. Yet, I was arguing with myself because I didnt want her to feel like I was doing this only because of the situation. During this appointment I was in my head and distant as I contemplated it. Afterwards, she mentioned how my actions were pretty clear in this appointment that I was against having our baby. I told her I was only distant because I have something on my mind I cannot share with her, because mentally I still hadnt decided. She didn't believe me. I couldnt pull the trigger because like I said I didnt want her to resent me thinking that I was only doing it for this reason.\n\nA week later she scheduled the abortion and told me that she decided to go forward with the abortion. \n\nThe day comes and I drive her there, outside I tell her we can leave and that we do not need to go in. She trudged in, and seemed very distant, understandably why. We go into the room and I am asking all of these questions out of concern for her during this. And then we wait, I told her we could leave, but she said no. \n\nIt happens and then I bring her home and do my best to make everything both comfortable and enjoyable by making her favorite dinner, and watching her favorite movie etc.\n\nWe do not talk about it and do not have sex for 2 months. I told her I am not going to pressure any of that and when she is ready we can go slow into whatever she wants to do. We are having good sex again, but she is very worried about anything getting into her. So we begin to see her therapist again, still we both are looking for jobs, and still doing our weekly dates as best as we can with covid and not being able to go to her house. \n\nFast forward 2 more months. And she got a job! I am still looking because in my field (teaching) they were distance learning and not in need of subs nor teachers. Soon summer was upon us and she was working 40 hours a week.\n\nEvent 3:\n\nWell by this time, I was pretty depressed by the abortion, the previously mentioned betrayal she felt from the accident, and now my lack of finding work. On top of all of that, with her working so much, I only got to see her max 9 hours a week. I associate that to both her busy schedule and her withdrawing from me. But during this time, I would mention getting married in our future and having a family when we are ready and simply telling her I still wanted that. I maybe brought it up once a month and she would cry and tell me she is not ready right now for those and that in the future she might be. I would tell her, I fully understand and that I only bring it up to assure her I still wanted that with her. \n\nWell for 3 months we handle this, and juggling little time spent together on her end, I had a bunch of free time because I was still looking for work. I would ask her to go out and do things (hikes, walks, water activities, movies, etc.) And she would tell me how she is busy and cannot until the weekend. Before all of this her and I would go on walks almost 4/7 days if not more with her dog for like an hour. I was becoming needy because I would ask her to include me in those things. I would sometimes cry and ask her if she wanted to see me, and she would respond that she sees me already as much as she wanted to in a week (9 hours). \n\nShe had me over for a family bbq and mind that at this time I had not been over to her house in almost 9 months. When I use to come over for many hours every week and help out her mom and spend time with my ex and her family. When I was there I was nervous. I stayed outside in the backyard with her siblings. When they wanted to go into eat, I denied the food because I didnt feel welcomed by her father and thus I didnt want to eat the food out of fear of him saying something. Well they grab food and come back out. My ex however does not. 3 minutes later I get a text telling me to leave and meet her near her house because her dad just yelled at her when they were alone in the kitchen. I slipped out and we take a walk and she is hurt, her dad told her that if she didnt get me off their property he was going to divorce her mom because of her. This hurt me deeply that he would say that. I texted her mom telling her thank you for inviting me and that her husband told my ex those things. \n\nNow to the most current thing:\n\nStill in this realm of feeling sad due to time spent, and everything, my ex and her family go on their family vacation. The one normally I always go on, yet I was not even invited and my ex never brought up considering inviting me. They leave for a week and I am happy for them to be going.\n\nWhen they return I plan a date for my ex and I the following day. It goes really well until the end. She begins telling me about the trip and how her sisters friends went. This made me feel sad and left out and I began to cry. I explained that I just felt excluded from her life the past few months. Especially now between the bbq and the trip where other people not even affiliated with any family member aside from being friends with them was invited. As well as the lack of her inviting me to do things we use to do together.\n\nShe is mad and tells me it is completely out of her control. And I tell her I understand completely that part (cabin/bbq) yet I wish she would try to invite me to more parts of her life I can be a part of.\n\nThe next day she is majorly distant, and so I call her and she tells me she is pissed at me. I give her a few days. Then we meet up and essentially she tells me that she doesnt know if she can give me what I need anymore. Going on to tell me that she doesnt see a future together, she doesnt want to have children with me, doesnt want to get married. She tells me that she spent a week having fun and that I ruined it by bringing all of that up. Then that we need to have space and a seperation. 1 month but we are still together she clarifies and that were not dating other people.\n\n2 weeks pass, and she texts me she cannot do it anymore. She calls me and tells me she wants to break up. I beg and plead, and she tells me she doesnt trust anything I say, she feels heart broken, she feels I hurt her, and that my actions have showed her this. She tells me she has given me many chances and that she keeps getting hurt. I try to defend myself by saying I understand but I have never made the same repeated mistakes of hurting her. She says nonetheless that they happened and unintentional or not, she is done being hurt. This hurts me because I truly never did do the same mistakes over and over again. She ends the call by telling me I love you.\n\nA week later we meet in person to talk about the break up. We talk for 3 hours. During this talk, she tells me many things that floor me mentally but I simply just take it because I didnt want the possible last moment to be negative. \n\nShe tells me that she has had so much clarity the last 3 weeks. She said that she realized first that I broke her trust and that really hurt, but then being she was in such a vulnerable place from this moment with the accident that when she had to decide about our baby, that I WAS THE REASON she chose to have the abortion. She goes on to say that my actions showed her I didnt want to have our baby with her, that my actions of having a panic attack and being distant were clear to her (despite me never once thinking I didnt want to have our baby with her). She broke down telling me this and I simply told her repeatedly I am sorry you believe that but that was not the case and it seems what I tell you, you do not believe. She said my actions were clear. So she essentially blamed me for our abortion, and the accident. Yet I chose her in the accident by both supporting her and blocking my family, as well, with the abortion I was supportive of her and keeping our baby, not to mention she never brought this up ans her reasons were focused on her parents opinion and her fear of that.\n\nThen she goes on to say our relationship became so toxic the last year that she now needs to find herself and heal. That she needs major space and time and that maybe in the future we could be together. Then she said she may need years of space from me to have a clean slate from what I did to her. She said she loves me, that I am an amazing person and I will have a great life. She will always care about me and is grateful for the amazing times we spent together. But she said she needs to do what is right for her. \n\nShe removed myself, my friends, and all of my family members from social media. Removed all of our photos and posts. Did not block, but asked me not to contact her. Which I have respected for months now. She said I can keep the animals and all of our belongings in storage from when we lived together. She has 0 friends as I believe I mentioned before because she has trouble both connecting and trusting them. But her one sibling that I am still friends with has posts on her wall that my ex posted and tagged her in so I can see them. They are about essentially \"Someone who loves you wouldnt do this, or someone who loves you shows you in their actions\" and other stuff seemingly out of resentment towards me. \n\nSince our breakup I have felt deep deep remorse, for our abortion, and the blame she put onto me. As well, grief, from her leaving me and outright projecting so much of her pain she never mentioned previously onto me.\n\nI have been doing better each day, working 3 jobs now, planning trips, and my future. Been on depression medication that helps also my anxiety for months since our breakup and seeing 2 therapists weekly. \n\nSo of course this was a long story. Sorry. But I wanted to get it out of my mind since I havent been sharing this with anyone except my therapists. \n\nWhat is your take on what has transpired? I am struggling deeply with all her blame. I feel like I was supportive and she told me I was not as much as I could have been. Meaning I didnt meet her expectations and ultimately she concluded by that, that I was just downright NOT supportive at all. Which like I said I feel is so untrue :(\n\nTLDR: My ex and I had no issues, then it all fell apart after an accident, her abortion, and a lack of spending time together this last year. She blames me for being unsupportive and says I was not there for her when she needed me.", "title": "Moving on hurts, I can do it.

I am 27 (M) she is 28 (F).\n\nMy ex and I were together for 6 years. I became very close with her family and siblings. Constantly going over to their houses for family events, dinners, and doing double dates with her siblings and their partners. Each week we made sure to go on a date forsure and spent many other days throughout our entire relationship. My ex and I were best friends, she doesnt have any friends. We took trips each year together, we got 2 animals together, we lived together for 4 years together. I would always do romantic gestures like leaving things on her car after work, or flowers randomly, or bath and spa nights. I put her on a pedastal and did my best to make her feel truly loved. \n\nWe never fought and honestly barely had any arguments about things. Thats how well we fit together. Similarly we had many of the same interests and even tried each others interest. I was there for her through tough times when both of her grandparents tragically passed away. I was an usher to walk the caskets down, which can tell you how close I was to her family. Each year I went with her family on family trips. \n\nFurther, we had similar values. We both didnt smoke, didnt do drugs, highly valued our religion that we share and had many similar world views and values for relationships. We valued each other enough to stay in communication every day no matter what by texting or talking. When we lived together, it was never an issue with cleanliness, cooking, etc. We both did our part and never expected the other to have to do such. We had similar future goals and dreams (travel, marriage, family, living on a lake, etc.) \n\nI can continue, but lets just say that we both felt very happy and in love together. We both expressed this daily. I never lied to her, I never cheated on her, I never did many things that would hurt someone outright. Further, I always tried to support her with her trauma and her own issues.\n\nNow for what happened:\n\nMy ex has a trauma history from her past 2 relationships. Abuse and lying. Neither relationship lasted more then 6 months. This happened when she moved away for college before she met me. She mentioned it to me, and told me how she can find it difficult to trust at times because of this. I always remembered this and made sure to never do anything sexual when we drank because I didnt want her to feel any negative way regarding that. As well, I consistently tried to build that trust and never hurt that trust until this last year.\n\nShe grew up homeschooled with all of her siblings in a strict household ran by her narcissistic and autistic father. For example, living at home at 28 she still has a curfew otherwise her dad yells at her. She fears her parents and wanta to make them happy and proud, seeking validation by doing right constantly. An example of this was when she started college it was for a career they suggested. Being in this environment, she has social anxiety and thus has 0 friends. All the years I was with her she made 3 friends and cut them out within 2-3 hangouts. \n\nMy ex was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and that was before we met. Those things all but went away or here I thought the first 5 years.\n\nSo no issues for 5 years, 6th year we have 3 things happen. I was planning to get engaged in 2021. As well, after college (end of 2019) we both moved back to our parents houses as we searched for our first jobs post college. Covid began, making it hard.\n\nFirst thing:\n\nMy ex and I go to my cabin. She gets on an ATV with my cousin, I make sure they both have helmets and I tell my younger cousin she needs to drive very responsibly because my girlfriend was on it. She said thats okay and I even told my ex if she would rather drive with me she can, yet she was alright going with my cousin. \n\n15 minutes later they are involved in a head on collison with a truck going around a very sharp turn at like 15 miles per hour. I was following them in my car and I was behind them by like a few hundred yards so I didnt see it happen due to the curve. Anyways I ran to my exes side. Held and compressed her leg as she was bleeding. Fast forward, I followed to the hospital and went into her room and waited the whole time with her. She was able to leave within 2 hours and had a tear in her muscle behind her knee, as well as a traumatic brain injury, and further a deviated septum.\n\nWe go back to my cabin, and I pretty much take care of my ex the next 24 hours til we leave for home. I helped her bathe, get dressed, made meals, grabbed ice or heat stuff, and even tried cheering her up by watching comedies she likes. \n\nAfter dinner my aunt (mother to my cousin) asked me for help. I asked what for and she explained to me that my cousin didnt finish her test to drive the ATV before we left. I told her that I feel uncomfortable doing that and so I opted out. An hour later she asks me again but now tells me that if I dont that the state could sue my grandparents. My grandparents live month to month on their retirement and social security, thus I felt obligated. Later I found out they had insurance and that she was manipulating me. However in this moment my ex felt like I broke her trust by taking this test that I felt obligated to take. She felt like I intentionally set out to cover it up that my cousin should not have been driving. I see where she is coming from but also I felt pressured into it by my aunt and I explained this to her but she said it hurts her still and her trust was broken. I apologized by writing her a letter explaining how I never intentionally meant for that.\n\nNow fast forward 2 months, my ex is still healing and I bring up possibly going to my cabin for a holiday and asking if she wanted to go. She said absolutely not, because my uncle and cousin may be there. I said I understand but this worried me because I was thinking about our future and how it would work regarding family occasions. I brought this up to her and we had a disagreement about it. I asked if they could come to a future wedding of ours, or if we held a family holiday would they be able to come? To which she said again absolutely not. I expressed how I felt about this considering this uncle was the one I was closest to. I said do you think in time your feelings will change? And she said no because of the permanent damage she felt from the accident. Then she brought up covering up for my cousin and that I should never speak to them again because of the pain they put her through via the accident and trust breaking. I took about a week to consider everything. During this time she thought and convinced herself I was choosing them over her BECAUSE I was arguing with her about them being in my life for future events. My family members also never reached out past the first week following the accident and she felt hurt by this. Yet, I reached out constantly and was supporting her healing process. I even wrote to her parents my apology for the damage she had been dealt. Unfortunately I will touch upon this later but her dad banished me from their house and family events.\n\nI blocked my cousin, aunt, and uncle and sent them a long message regarding everything. Up to this point 2 months after the accident I had not spoken to them, and had been supporting my ex's healing progress. So not only did I not speak to them, but I blocked them and wrote what they did wrong and how it was not acceptable. Thus in this moment choosing her over my family members. She came back at the end of that week despite all of this and said my actions showed I chose my family over her and she felt very hurt by this. She said my actions to argue against her for people who hurt her was clear to her how I felt. These arguments were never yelling or anything, it was simply me asking if they would be able to be at certain events and my reasoning why I would appreciate them there. And even after me making my actions clear about not speaking to them since, and blocking them, she still felt betrayed because as she said, \"my actions are clear and you chose them over me.\"\n\nWell we dropped this topic moving forward because she was focusing on healing and I blocked them. Yet she still seemed hurt. Now her father is a great person, yet he is strict and he has autism. She never shared with her parents all the details. Simply the details of the accident. Before the accident I was at her house 2/7 days in a week I would say because that way my ex and I could see each other because she liked being at home. Then 2/7 days at my house. And 1 of those 4 days we would do a full date all day or all night. Anyways, since the accident her father grew very resentful to me. Despite my apology in writing, and even in person. He would argue with my ex that she needed to break up with me and that I was not a good person because I let her get on a dangerous machine. Mind you my ex is 27 and I am not controlling thus I did what I could by warning my cousin to be safe and giving them helmets. So her father blamed me, and he told I am not allowed over to their house. So now, my ex and I only saw each other at my house and less. Even so, my ex told me that she had to lie to her father where she was going because he would consistently yell at her to break up with me because I am not a good person for letting her get hurt.\n\nFast forward 3 more months, were still doing weekly dates and still having sex frequently. We are getting into a better place as we close into graduating. At this time, we were at our parents doing internships. I still am not allowed over and she is even having me pick her up a street over because she did not want her dad to see when we would spend time together. This was hard for me but I never argued about it and just understood despite how bad I felt that her dad hated me when I didnt cause the accident. We are spending less time together because of her father on her back, and because she doesnt prefer to always come to my house (I have smokers in the house and she hates the smell, as do I but I need to deal with it until I could move out again) i would always spray and light candles to make it better.\n\nEvent 2:\n\nNow another month forward we are now into the beginning of 2020, we find out that we are unexpectedly pregnant. We used birth control but it must have failed. She brings out the test and as I wait I am smiling thinking about everything. When she brings them both out they are both positive I hug her and then I begin to have a panic attack. Let me make an important note here, I have an anxiety disorder which she knew about. My panic is breathing heavy, heart racing, face likely looking panicked, and intrusive thoughts. These thoughts began to come out, as I explained to her this: \"I am so grateful and happy for this. I am worried though because neither of us have jobs, we are living at our parents and you dont want to live with me because of your parents, as well your parents are going to be mad at me even more then they were with the accident.\" She begins to cry, and tells me this is suppose to be a happy moment. I tell her I agree 100%, and I am happy, but we are going to need to figure some things out so that we stay happy. I dont want her and I to struggle financially in any way, I grew up poor and thats why I push myself to work and find a career. She agrees but still seems really sad. \n\nI see her about a week later and she begins telling me we need to go to her therapist. I ask why and she says we need to make a big decision. Continuing I ask whats that. She said we have 3 options, keep our baby, give our baby up for adoption, or abortion. I tell her thats okay and we go to her therapist. During this session she breaks down crying because she is worried about everything, she speaks for atleast have of the session about her parents and why she is worried they will disown her, and why she is worried about their opinion about premarital sex and a baby our of marriage. We leave with the therapist telling us to come back in a week with pros and cons for each option. \n\nAfter seeing her cry and worry, I spent the next month looking for work 8 hours a day. Yet it was covid layoffs happening and so I couldnt find squat. Anyways, a week later I bring my pros, my cons, as does she. I preface the talk with saying I want to keep our baby, I have been looking for work, and I dont want her parents to be a reason why we choose something like this. Then I also say I will continue to step up.\nWe give our pros and cons for each and hers are mostly focused on her parents and the lack of financial security. I understand and we talk about the options in therapy.\n\nAnother week and at this point we are going together to all of the doctors appointments. She talks to me and asks me what do I want to do? I tell her she seems pretty set on abortion based on our talk in therapy, that I want to keep our baby, but if not then I still want children in our future. She tells me she is leaning on abortion, and I tell her I will have to support this decision.\n\nFinally she and I go to a doctors appointment and the whole time I am nervous because the night before I was highly debating buying an engagement ring and proposing to her. Yet, I was arguing with myself because I didnt want her to feel like I was doing this only because of the situation. During this appointment I was in my head and distant as I contemplated it. Afterwards, she mentioned how my actions were pretty clear in this appointment that I was against having our baby. I told her I was only distant because I have something on my mind I cannot share with her, because mentally I still hadnt decided. She didn't believe me. I couldnt pull the trigger because like I said I didnt want her to resent me thinking that I was only doing it for this reason.\n\nA week later she scheduled the abortion and told me that she decided to go forward with the abortion. \n\nThe day comes and I drive her there, outside I tell her we can leave and that we do not need to go in. She trudged in, and seemed very distant, understandably why. We go into the room and I am asking all of these questions out of concern for her during this. And then we wait, I told her we could leave, but she said no. \n\nIt happens and then I bring her home and do my best to make everything both comfortable and enjoyable by making her favorite dinner, and watching her favorite movie etc.\n\nWe do not talk about it and do not have sex for 2 months. I told her I am not going to pressure any of that and when she is ready we can go slow into whatever she wants to do. We are having good sex again, but she is very worried about anything getting into her. So we begin to see her therapist again, still we both are looking for jobs, and still doing our weekly dates as best as we can with covid and not being able to go to her house. \n\nFast forward 2 more months. And she got a job! I am still looking because in my field (teaching) they were distance learning and not in need of subs nor teachers. Soon summer was upon us and she was working 40 hours a week.\n\nEvent 3:\n\nWell by this time, I was pretty depressed by the abortion, the previously mentioned betrayal she felt from the accident, and now my lack of finding work. On top of all of that, with her working so much, I only got to see her max 9 hours a week. I associate that to both her busy schedule and her withdrawing from me. But during this time, I would mention getting married in our future and having a family when we are ready and simply telling her I still wanted that. I maybe brought it up once a month and she would cry and tell me she is not ready right now for those and that in the future she might be. I would tell her, I fully understand and that I only bring it up to assure her I still wanted that with her. \n\nWell for 3 months we handle this, and juggling little time spent together on her end, I had a bunch of free time because I was still looking for work. I would ask her to go out and do things (hikes, walks, water activities, movies, etc.) And she would tell me how she is busy and cannot until the weekend. Before all of this her and I would go on walks almost 4/7 days if not more with her dog for like an hour. I was becoming needy because I would ask her to include me in those things. I would sometimes cry and ask her if she wanted to see me, and she would respond that she sees me already as much as she wanted to in a week (9 hours). \n\nShe had me over for a family bbq and mind that at this time I had not been over to her house in almost 9 months. When I use to come over for many hours every week and help out her mom and spend time with my ex and her family. When I was there I was nervous. I stayed outside in the backyard with her siblings. When they wanted to go into eat, I denied the food because I didnt feel welcomed by her father and thus I didnt want to eat the food out of fear of him saying something. Well they grab food and come back out. My ex however does not. 3 minutes later I get a text telling me to leave and meet her near her house because her dad just yelled at her when they were alone in the kitchen. I slipped out and we take a walk and she is hurt, her dad told her that if she didnt get me off their property he was going to divorce her mom because of her. This hurt me deeply that he would say that. I texted her mom telling her thank you for inviting me and that her husband told my ex those things. \n\nNow to the most current thing:\n\nStill in this realm of feeling sad due to time spent, and everything, my ex and her family go on their family vacation. The one normally I always go on, yet I was not even invited and my ex never brought up considering inviting me. They leave for a week and I am happy for them to be going.\n\nWhen they return I plan a date for my ex and I the following day. It goes really well until the end. She begins telling me about the trip and how her sisters friends went. This made me feel sad and left out and I began to cry. I explained that I just felt excluded from her life the past few months. Especially now between the bbq and the trip where other people not even affiliated with any family member aside from being friends with them was invited. As well as the lack of her inviting me to do things we use to do together.\n\nShe is mad and tells me it is completely out of her control. And I tell her I understand completely that part (cabin/bbq) yet I wish she would try to invite me to more parts of her life I can be a part of.\n\nThe next day she is majorly distant, and so I call her and she tells me she is pissed at me. I give her a few days. Then we meet up and essentially she tells me that she doesnt know if she can give me what I need anymore. Going on to tell me that she doesnt see a future together, she doesnt want to have children with me, doesnt want to get married. She tells me that she spent a week having fun and that I ruined it by bringing all of that up. Then that we need to have space and a seperation. 1 month but we are still together she clarifies and that were not dating other people.\n\n2 weeks pass, and she texts me she cannot do it anymore. She calls me and tells me she wants to break up. I beg and plead, and she tells me she doesnt trust anything I say, she feels heart broken, she feels I hurt her, and that my actions have showed her this. She tells me she has given me many chances and that she keeps getting hurt. I try to defend myself by saying I understand but I have never made the same repeated mistakes of hurting her. She says nonetheless that they happened and unintentional or not, she is done being hurt. This hurts me because I truly never did do the same mistakes over and over again. She ends the call by telling me I love you.\n\nA week later we meet in person to talk about the break up. We talk for 3 hours. During this talk, she tells me many things that floor me mentally but I simply just take it because I didnt want the possible last moment to be negative. \n\nShe tells me that she has had so much clarity the last 3 weeks. She said that she realized first that I broke her trust and that really hurt, but then being she was in such a vulnerable place from this moment with the accident that when she had to decide about our baby, that I WAS THE REASON she chose to have the abortion. She goes on to say that my actions showed her I didnt want to have our baby with her, that my actions of having a panic attack and being distant were clear to her (despite me never once thinking I didnt want to have our baby with her). She broke down telling me this and I simply told her repeatedly I am sorry you believe that but that was not the case and it seems what I tell you, you do not believe. She said my actions were clear. So she essentially blamed me for our abortion, and the accident. Yet I chose her in the accident by both supporting her and blocking my family, as well, with the abortion I was supportive of her and keeping our baby, not to mention she never brought this up ans her reasons were focused on her parents opinion and her fear of that.\n\nThen she goes on to say our relationship became so toxic the last year that she now needs to find herself and heal. That she needs major space and time and that maybe in the future we could be together. Then she said she may need years of space from me to have a clean slate from what I did to her. She said she loves me, that I am an amazing person and I will have a great life. She will always care about me and is grateful for the amazing times we spent together. But she said she needs to do what is right for her. \n\nShe removed myself, my friends, and all of my family members from social media. Removed all of our photos and posts. Did not block, but asked me not to contact her. Which I have respected for months now. She said I can keep the animals and all of our belongings in storage from when we lived together. She has 0 friends as I believe I mentioned before because she has trouble both connecting and trusting them. But her one sibling that I am still friends with has posts on her wall that my ex posted and tagged her in so I can see them. They are about essentially \"Someone who loves you wouldnt do this, or someone who loves you shows you in their actions\" and other stuff seemingly out of resentment towards me. \n\nSince our breakup I have felt deep deep remorse, for our abortion, and the blame she put onto me. As well, grief, from her leaving me and outright projecting so much of her pain she never mentioned previously onto me.\n\nI have been doing better each day, working 3 jobs now, planning trips, and my future. Been on depression medication that helps also my anxiety for months since our breakup and seeing 2 therapists weekly. \n\nSo of course this was a long story. Sorry. But I wanted to get it out of my mind since I havent been sharing this with anyone except my therapists. \n\nWhat is your take on what has transpired? I am struggling deeply with all her blame. I feel like I was supportive and she told me I was not as much as I could have been. Meaning I didnt meet her expectations and ultimately she concluded by that, that I was just downright NOT supportive at all. Which like I said I feel is so untrue :(\n\nTLDR: My ex and I had no issues, then it all fell apart after an accident, her abortion, and a lack of spending time together this last year.

The years of neglect were finally catching up to me. What do I have to show for my life?\n\nI wasted my time: procrastinating, gaming, scrolling through social media, and that's about it. I could not run a mile, had a terrible work ethic, and was drowning in disappointment at the life I had to wake up to every day.\n\nI tried to change. All of my attempts failed. The year 2020 is where I made one last attempt and it worked.\n\nI have gone on a run every day of 2021, I learned programming in 2020, I read 12 books in 2020, I built a strong work ethic, and I can finally say that I changed. How?\n\nMindset\n\n&gt;\"In the face of weakness, determination sets in. Day after day I kept at it, and every tiny increase in strength broadened the possible worlds, the possible versions of me\"- *When Breath Becomes Air*, Paul Kalanithi\n\nNothing starts without a shift in mindset. I left out one detail when I was talking about my final attempt at change: why it worked.\n\nBelieving that you can change is probably the most powerful thing you can do in terms of self-improvement. Every one of my previous attempts had failed, what made this one any different? I believed that this time I could change. Have the belief that you can change.\n\nCommit\n\n&gt;\u201cNo one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich.\u201d- *Outliers,* Malcolm Gladwell\n\nNow you have the belief that you can change. Now all that needs to occur is the actual changing. This tip is simple, commit to changing. You need to draft certain things to improve in your life and follow through.\n\nI committed to running every day at the beggining of 2021. Commit. Really commit. Commit like your life depends on it. Make this new self your new identity. Commit to that new self becoming you.\n\nPeople\n\n&gt;***Belief*** *is easier when it occurs within a* ***community.*** There\u2019s something really powerful about groups and shared experiences. People might be skeptical about their ability to change if they\u2019re by themselves, but a group will convince them to suspend disbelief. A community creates belief.\"- *The Power of Habit,* Charles Duhigg\n\nAccountability, support, and community also helped me. I would tell my friends about my \"bad day\" and they would pick me up. I would ask my dad to go on a run with me. I would check in with my friends, who were also running. I would get inspired by subreddits dealing with the habit. People sharing. People forming their own habits.\n\nIf they could change, so could I.\n\nTracking\n\n&gt;\u201cYou are the master of your destiny. You can influence, direct and control your own environment. You can make your life what you want it to be.\u201d- *Think and Grow Rich,* Napoleon Hill\n\nI also bought a bullet journal around the beggining of 2020. I wrote my goals, habits, schedule, todos, and what I was doing throughout the day down. I think this also helped in accountability.\n\nAlso, little side note, but reading is also really powerful for some people. I think a lot of what I read motivated me to pull through.\n\nWhat Now?\n\n&gt;Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage- *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, Dale Carnegie\n\nNow, I hope you can take this advice and FINALLY change!\n\nNow, go get out a sheet of paper and write down who you want to be, believe that you can change, commit to changing, follow through, get some people to motivate you, write down stuff about your days.

I literally become obsessed and my thought processes revolve around trying to fight with this person or preparing for a battle of some sort (even if it's in my head). I think I get this from my codependent relationship with my mom. \n\nGrowing up, she'd always be there to fight my battles for me and remind me that I should be \"grateful\" to have her doing all of that for me and having better discernment than me instead of me learning to stand/think on my own. But I also liked to play fire with fire and then immediately run to her when I got burned. In turn, I've noticed that I've gotten in a lot of friendships with motherly-type women where I build a dependence on them and come to them with all of my issues, wanting them to \"save me\" from myself or from the issue/person that I'm currently dealing with. It was always some drama that I was dealing with; and the trade off for them is that they feel power/control over me because I will literally do as they say without questioning it. My therapist calls this \"using their mind as the only right mind.\"\n\nI was recently going through a tough patch at work with someone who was constantly disrespecting me. It was awful behavior and I didn't feel supported, but I fixated on this person so much and how they were doing me wrong and needed to feel vindicated for being the victim of his behavior. And then I sat with that and realized: \"Yes, this person is shitty and being able to confront them/assert myself is scary but why do I need to be a victim of yet *another* person? Why do I need another drama to lament about?\" And I realized I'd been acting like that a lot in my late teens/early-mid 20s. It's no wonder why I felt like I was going around in circles. Wouldn't it be better to extract the lesson in the situation and just move on? It's actually nice not to fixate on someone shitty or someone that doesn't have bearing on my life in the grand scheme of things. Can I just be going through something and working it out instead of \"and they did this and they did that to me and blah blah blah... woe is me...\"?\n\nBeing in this victim mentality only gave the person more power over me and at times made it painfully impossible for me to get over bad situations or people that were yes awful, but only deserved my pity or less headspace and attention. It's like being bitter empowered me.\n\nFor years, I had to keep clinging onto the drama or the cooked up drama in my head to feel somehow in control even though... I wasn't in control at all. I was letting my emotions run my moods and overall logical function of how to deal with difficult situations because I truly felt (and to a certain degree was conditioned to feel) that I couldn't handle life's obstacles without someone holding my hand. This was hard to accept.\n\nAnd as much as I used to *think* I don't like drama (I really didn't think I liked drama lol)... **I like drama**. It contradicts this version of myself in my head that I think I have, this victim who is also perfect and doesn't care, but when I Googled what the opposite of \"villain\" is, it is not \"victim.\" It is \"hero.\" Heroes don't go at things alone for sure, but they also don't get caught up in the petty drama of what they are trying to accomplish. They aren't some sacrificial lamb that needs to be coddled; they consistently learn and keep going.\n\nComing to this conclusion has brought some peace.

When I say destructive - things that destroy a child's self esteem, sense of safety and trust and later end up messing their decisions and responses to life as an adult.  \n\nI get a very bad taste when I look at things objectively and dispassionately about how a kid was treated, a hapless kid by a fully grown adult. Parents should remember their responsibility to children, but often they punish their children by projecting their own failings into them and get some sick sense of satisfaction in breaking their spirit and controlling them. I know not everyone is like that. I also know going through it makes you more conscious of what is good parenting and helps you someday probably to create a safe and loving space for your children. \n\nThey say the tormented becomes the tormenter and that can happen to anyone. So if you were ever at the receiving of any kind of abuse, verbal, emotional or physical from someone you trusted - please do the right thing and find someone who can help you. \n\nIt's not an overnight change, but even working on something just eases the load off from your mind and leaves you at peace.\n\nHope you all have a lovely day.", "title": "If you have trust issues and a bunch of toxic behaviours"}, {"created_utc": 1619705598, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n158hr/sleep_and_self_improvement_give_yourself_a_shot/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "Most people know that lack of sleep means tiredness and less energy, but did you know it also leads to weight gain, lower sex drive, heart disease, missing more days of work/school, getting along worse with other people and developing diabetes? \n\nResearch says a good sleep routine should be a huge asset to everyone on a self improvement journey.

I knew it was wrong, I want to be clear and say I am not using my past as an excuse I am just telling my story.\n\nBy 18 I was married and using my then wife like a sex toy.

After few months being locked into my home, relying on delivery and quick jumps to nearby store, I've realized that my average daily step count was about 3k steps.\n\nSo armed with the knowledge that 10K steps is better than nothing, I\u2019ve started slowly to build my habit towards 10K steps a day and by doing 10k steps a day, I\u2019ve found some interesting benefits I want to share with you and maybe motivate you to **try** to reach 10k steps a day.\n\n## Benefits of doing 10k steps a day\n\n## 1. Its easy to start\n\nThe main problem is that getting into any sport \u2013 requires financial investment and developing a mental love to it. Even simple things like running \u2013 requires you at least get comfortable running shoes, and I won\u2019t talk about other sports like gym \u2013 which requires membership or equipment if you want to work out from home; cycling \u2013 which requires a bicycle \u2013 obviously; boxing, rowing, skiing \u2013 which all require  equipment / membership and the latter also depends on weather. More over, sport is an individual thing. I hate running. I tried, multiple times. I hate it. Some people swear by it, I suffer when I run. And I don\u2019t like to suffer, so I don\u2019t run.\n\nHowever walking is something native to us. We walk all the time \u2013 whether its from the chair to the fridge, from our houses to a bus stop, in a super market, or just by the beach. Walking is natural to human beings. It requires zero equipment (you can even walk barefoot \u2013 some  people claim its better, I prefer shoes though) and its practically impossible to hate it \u2013 as its the basic form of moving as opposed to sitting.\n\n## 2. Its great for multi tasking\n\nWhen you run or cycle, row or lift weights \u2013 you are most likely trying to reach a goal be it distance, number of repetitions, weight of each repetition or speed \u2013 but you try to push your body to its limits. And when you push your body to its limits, it hard to do other tasks such as catching up with family or friends. Try to run and have a phone  call with your friend or do bench press and catch up with your family.\n\nWalking on the other hand does not raise your heart rate too much (unless you are doing fast walking) which enables you to do other tasks.  When I walk I tend to use this time to: catch with family or friends, listen to audio-book or podcast, listen to music, or clean my mind and explore, which brings me to the next 2 points.\n\n## 3. It\u2019s good for cleaning up your mind\n\nWhether you\u2019ve had an argument with your SO, can\u2019t figure out a solution to hard problem or your mind is just occupied with thoughts, its always a good decision to take a walk.\n\nBy walking, you are not worried about speed or distance, repetitions or weight, you just move \u2013 leaving your mind free to focus on other things. When I\u2019m worried or have troubles concentrating, I\u2019m going for a walk. It helps me clean my mind, get rid of my worries. There is even a walking meditation if you\u2019d like to try it (I haven\u2019t). I usually feel way better in terms of concentration or worries \u2013 when I come back from a walk.\n\n## 4. It brings the explorer in you and teach you to appreciate whats around you\n\nHuman beings are explorers. Before creating a settlement, we used to wander in searches for the best place to settle. Close to water source, away from predators, uphill for easier defense. By walking daily \u2013 you feed the explorer in you.\n\nYou might have moved to a new neighborhood or live in the same one  for the majority of your life \u2013 but how much of it you really know? Can you navigate your way home from any point in your neighborhood without a GPS? Do you know to tell me where I can find a good park or a nice bakery in your neighborhood, without checking Google Maps? I\u2019ve learned to appreciate this exploration, I found some nice restaurants, great parks that are few minutes of walk away from my home and it comes really helpful now, when my wife and I are looking to move to a different apartment. Before I\u2019ve used to walk and explore my neighborhood or the ones close to it, I wouldn\u2019t know who lives in each neighborhood. Is it a good neighborhood? Is this green spot on Google Maps a park or just  some grass with benches? But after exploring my neighborhood and the ones close to it, I know to say where good parks are located. What type of people live in each neighborhood. Whether its a noisy one because its located near a central street or a school or a quiet one because its full of small houses rather than tall buildings.\n\nIt also helped me to learn to appreciate things. When you walk, your mind is free to look around, judge the architecture, explore parks, smell the smell of fresh bread or coffee. The internet is full of  negative stuff, and by taking a walk I balance the negativity with positive appreciation. There was one day when I was walking and a light rain started, but instead of panicking and hiding I\u2019ve just embraced it and walked under the rain, smiling.\n\n## 5. It gives you perspective on distance\n\nBefore I started to aim to do 10k steps a day, I\u2019d look at directions to my doctors appointment, restaurant or a shop, in Google Maps and  judge its distance. 30 minutes of walk, to me back then, considered too long. I would opt for a bus ride or a taxi in that way, even if it took the same 30 minutes. My mind just wasn\u2019t grasping 3-4km of walking as something bearable or worth doing. But after I\u2019ve walked 10k steps for  some time now and realized that it takes around 1.5 to 2 hours and  amounts to around 7-8km \u2013 I look at directions differently.\n\nThe other day, I was invited to a gathering activity with my work colleagues. The walk was 45 minutes and 3.5km from the place I live. 5-6 months ago I would have never took that walk, if you\u2019d asked me to. For me at that time, 45 minutes of walking is too much. Today I realize that walking back and forth is not even 10k steps. And by aiming to do 10k steps a day, I decided to take that walk. And was engaged in other activities such as catching up with family, listening to an audio book, exploring new locations and appreciating the beautiful world we live in.\n\n## How to start?\n\nI want to finish with some tips on how you can start building your habit of walking 10k steps a day. Remember 2 important principles:\n\n## 1. You don\u2019t need any fancy equipment\n\nWalking is easy. You need regular cloth and shoes. You don\u2019t need trainers or special equipment. You don\u2019t even need a fitness tracker (however it did help **me** to kick start this habit) \u2013  your regular smartphone probably have a builtin pedometer in it. Just take your smartphone, a pair of headphones and a nice audio-book or podcast \u2013 and go for a walk. You can even skip the headphones and the audio book and just walk \u2013 looking around, wandering, taking turns you never would have took. Just make sure your GPS works, so you won\u2019t get  lost in your first explorations of the neighborhood.\n\nI tend to split my walks to two segments: one in the day and on in the evening. By taking a daily walk you also expose yourself to the sun which is important in order to get vitamin D, and since its hard to carve 1.5 hours of free time during a working day, I tend to do my longer walk at the evening, when I\u2019m done with work. It also helps me do a mental shift between work and home. I spend most of my time in front of my computer, and sometimes its hard to do a mental shift between work and hobbies since I literally stay at the same place when my work day is over. Some people like to dress up to work even when WFH, and then when they finish work, they switch to their home cloth to signal their brain of a mental shift from work to home mode. I find it too much of a hassle, however taking a walk does the trick for me. If you have a dog, take it with you \u2013 it does good to dogs as well.\n\nI also suggest you start small. Identify how much you are doing right now. It  can be 2k or it can be 7k. And then try to increase that number by 1k for each week you were able to do it consistently. If you fail at your next goal, downgrade it back by 1k and do that for another week. For each intermediary goal \u2013 you should **not** feel any muscle pain or extreme struggle to do it. If you feel muscle pain the next day, or you find it hard to reach your goal, keep doing it until you find it easy and only then switch to the next thousand.\n\n## 2. Walking is better than nothing\n\nThere is no guideline as to how much time you need to put into active lifestyle. And I\u2019m not a doctor \u2013 so consult with one first, but the general consensus is that you should do moderate intensity aerobic and anaerobic activities. However sometimes its hard, some days we feel lazy, and not everyone can workout daily. And walking is better than slumping on the couch.\n\nDon\u2019t stress with the 10k steps **a day** goal if you don\u2019t feel like it. I decided for myself that on days when I\u2019m working out \u2013 I might not reach 10k steps. In the end my time in the day is limited and if I did 1 hour workout, I might go for a 30 minute walk that day instead of the full 1.5 hours. If I did a 20km bike ride, I  might skip the walking for that day. Because the end goal is to stay active and healthy, so I don\u2019t want to stress about it if I\u2019m tired after a workout or had a busy day and was able to dedicate only 1 hour for activity that day. But I do try to stay active **every day** whether its aerobic or anaerobic activity, or walking 10k steps.", "title": "Why you should aim to walk 10k steps a day and how to start"}, {"created_utc": 1619701220, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n13t67/highschooler_changes_for_good_creating_a_new/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "High-Schooler Changes for Good: Creating a New Mindset.

Basically, the gist of this post is that, mentally and physically, I am actually probably in the upper 95-99%tile, though admittedly, of course it's not a competition. I have really worked on myself for many, many years, and finally find myself in a place where I think that I have embodied 'success'. Yet, I am tortured by my absolutely abhorrent sleep habits and I think it's ruining my life. Basically, I have had sleep issues since a teen, but before that, I never had *any* issue sleeping, as per my mom/dad and my friends, brothers and sisters, etc. \n\nI am diagnosed as ADHD, and have been on Adderall XR for years. There is absolutely no doubt that it has dramatically improved my life, at least with respect to my career and family life. I feel very much more in control on it, and for all intents, it really does do what it is supposed to do. I have been on various doses, 10-40mg, and experimented up to 60mg, but generally, I have come to accept the best dose is somewhere around 10-20mg XR, which is a pretty normal 'target' dose for an adult. I take it in the morning, and the effects seem to last about 10-12 hours. I fall asleep, and sleep generally great. I can even nap during the day, no problem. The issue is I get up way too early. And no matter what I do, I can't seem to convince my racing brain to go back to bed!!!!\n\nI have mentioned ALL of this to my psychiatrist, and we have experimented with dosing, also experimented with going to instant release instead of extended (that was my idea), to see if it would help me sleep - with the idea being it would be out of my system. It didn't help at all. In fact, it made me even worse, since it wore off way too quick.\n\nIn short, it's not the Adderall causing my sleep problems. I had this issue well before the stimulants. \n\nI think caffeine is actually more or less a bigger cause of this. NOT an effect of the caffeine, rather, a sort of compulsion to just drink drink drink that shit right when I wake up! Which, when its 5am or 6am, is possibly ok - but NOT when it's 2am. Furthermore, I have a VERY regimented exercise routine, and I feel that it sometimes stresses me out. I look physically ripped, with a built and muscular body, toned abs, etc. But man, I feel like I am getting weaker every day! For the record, I recently got a full body physical with EKG, blood work, etc and basically, everything is unremarkable...I am totally healthy. \n\nI feel sort of ashamed even having this problem, because I feel like people would freakin' kill to have a problem of 'I can't sleep in'. I mean, it almost sounds comical. BUT if you've experienced it, it's hell. \n\nThis week, I have made a goal of dramatically cutting back on stimulants, and exercise. Just one week. The clocks changing is a good catalyst, since I sort of artificially have reset myself forward an hour. Any help appreciated! My wife, who's very loving and supportive, has suggested it could be cortisol, or anxiety related. I was on SSRIs and even klonopin many years ago, and generally, I didn't think it helped. I have been in and out of therapy before for anxiety, CBT and whatnot. Perhaps I will mention it to my psychiatrist? He's a very good doctor, who trusts me with the Adderall, since I have been on it many years without abuse or issue...I am also very, very against sleeping medication, and my doctor agrees that is a last resort. I have found some things, like CBD, and Delta-8 THC DO help with sleep. But I'd like to pinpoint the underlying issue instead of just blindly treating symptoms.

I think one of the hidden obstacles is that we often try to achieve things that, deep down, we don't believe we can do.\n\nWe tell ourselves we **should** be able to do this, or we're **supposed** to be able to do this. Often our standard is set based on what others are doing (or worse, what we *perceive* that others are doing). The trouble is, our conscious (and often negative) thoughts - \"I should be able to do this\" - are in conflict with our subconscious beliefs - \"I'm not sure I can do this\".\n\nBy going through this endless cycle, we create an atmosphere of shame and punishment. But this is nothing to be ashamed of or to punish ourselves over. What we need here is some love and acceptance of **ourselves** as we really are.\n\nThe way I see it, there are two ways to go about this:\n\n1. Start developing our feelings of \"self-efficacy\". Self-efficacy is the combination of your actual ability and your attitude about your ability. It's a positive cycle of believing you can do something, and then getting better at it, which makes it easier to believe, which makes it easier to get better and so on. I think starting at either point - improving your skills or working on your beliefs - works great. As this develops, our subconscious beliefs develop and start to work for us rather than against us.\n2. Start *accepting* instead of fighting those subconscious beliefs, and work **with** them. If you just \"can't\" believe that you could jog 5K every day after having not exercised in six months, okay!  What **can** you do?  Can you walk for 30 minutes? 15? Even just 5? Fantastic!  Start there. Experience, see and feel yourself *actually* doing something, and see what happens with your subconscious beliefs (see #1!). The way I see it, it's better to start slow and eventually get to where you're \"supposed\" to be than have to fight with yourself to start there.\n\nThe world can be tough enough as it is, and I hope we all decide to be our own best allies instead of continuing this internal struggle. As always, I love interaction so share your thoughts, questions and definitely even disagreements with me.\n\nGood luck on your journeys, whatever they may be!", "title": "The importance of self-efficacy"}, {"created_utc": 1615764732, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m57b1k/how_to_get_over_numbness/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "I realized, i got so used to running away from my problems by numbing my brain that i cannot watch or read, basically focus on anything other than stupid youtube, or shallow Instagram videos.

Why is the default mental narrative of so many people \u201cI\u2019m a failure and I have no hope of getting better\u201d?\n\nWho put those poisonous words in your head? Who taught you to feel so much shame? I don\u2019t think this is you. I think you\u2019re trying to live someone else\u2019s life, walk in someone else\u2019s shoes and stumbling because they don\u2019t fit right.\n\nBecause society has a lot of expectations about your life. Society has a scoring rubric about what a good career looks like, or a happy relationship, or a flawless body. Society projects a lot of ideals onto us about the \u201cright life.\u201d And I think you\u2019re breaking your toes trying to fit into a shoe that was never made for you.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to tell you that you\u2019re a special star in your own way and you\u2019re better than society\u2019s stupid ideals. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve got issues, you have scars, and there\u2019s a lot you want to do better. And it\u2019s good to try and get better. But you\u2019re not going to go very far while you keep hobbling in that ridiculously poor fitting shoe.\n\nYou are not a failure just because you don\u2019t fit the mold life tried to force onto you. Everyone has different experiences growing up, different skills, different passions, different fears. How insane is it that we could all turn out the same way? The mold society has is just a guide that helps society survive. \n\nIf everyone in a society tries to be healthy and climb the ladder at work then the society will have a good economy and prosper. That\u2019s the point of the mold. It\u2019s not designed to make you happy, it\u2019s not designed with an individual in mind, and it is impossible that more than a handful of random people could fit it perfectly. That\u2019s why we glorify workaholics and people that volunteer and successful entrepreneurs. These are all individuals that happen to benefit the economy or their community. Society teaches us to value the things that are good for society - not us.\n\nYou are not a failure. You are just trying to wear someone else\u2019s shoes. So stop tearing yourself apart. Stop saying \u201cI\u2019m a failure because X\u201d and ask if X is actually important to you or if society just said it was. Ask yourself what is really important to you, and focus on that. \n\nI spent so many nights hating myself because my career was mundane. I felt broken because I was introverted and didn\u2019t like going out. I thought I was hideous and ugly because I didn\u2019t have a six pack. I thought something was wrong with me because I didn\u2019t know how to be what society wanted.\n\nThat\u2019s horseshit. Working 80 hours a week isn\u2019t actually important to me. Going to bars or clubs wasn\u2019t important to me. And I could be perfectly healthy without having a six pack. So why did I treat those like failures? \n\nI don\u2019t know you. I don\u2019t know things about yourself you really want to change and which parts simply don\u2019t match the blueprint society gave you. But I need you to think about it. I need you to ask yourself what is really important. Ask yourself who you want to be. Because society doesn\u2019t know what is best for you. And life won\u2019t get better until you figure that out for yourself.\n\nThe best you is someone who enjoys each day. Someone who doesn\u2019t tear themselves apart because their values are different than society\u2019s. Someone who learns what is important to them and tries to be a better version of themself - not someone who tries to be someone else.\n\nAccepting who you are doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re perfect and shouldn\u2019t try to improve. It just means **you\u2019re not a failure for who you are today.** We\u2019re all works in progress. And if we stop hating ourselves for 5 minutes we can look around and enjoy taking one step forward today even if there\u2019s a lot of steps left. \n\nWhen you get to the end, it\u2019s over. When you get to your last step you\u2019re going to wish you had taken your time and smelled the roses along the way. You\u2019re never going to be perfect. So don\u2019t wish away the days that you\u2019re getting better. Try to accept who you are and enjoy them. \n\nStop trying to live someone else\u2019s life. This is your life, and you can\u2019t get it back once it is gone.\n\nFurther reading: If this resonated with you then I highly recommend \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d by Paulo Coelho. It\u2019s a short novel about finding what is important to you, and it\u2019s helped a lot of people disengage from the society life gave them that they never wanted. You will never be happy while living someone else\u2019s life. Take off those horrible shoes. They\u2019re causing you so much pain, you\u2019ll go much farther when you live the life that fits you.

You have absolutely no way of knowing you'll ever get a job in the industry or even that you'll like the job as much as you think.\n\nThere are probably plenty of qualified and skilled people in the industry already so how do you know that it won't all just be a waste of time and money? I know you could say well you just have to persevere and eventually things will work out if you try enough but you cannot prove that at all. Also many people cannot afford to put their lives on hold indefinitely for something like a career change. \n\nHow do I develop level of belief and confidence that is based on pure faith and no evidence at all? And how do I rationalise the outcomes that disprove that confidence when they inevitably occur?", "title": "How do people have faith or confidence in something they really have no proof of or control over?"}, {"created_utc": 1615718201, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m4swhg/im_more_interested_in_appearing_smart_in_front_of/", "num_comments": 17, "score": 1, "selftext": "\nRight now I'm reading an editorial column about the new digital media rules in my country after every paragraph I read, I imagine someone saying something that's contrary to the article and me SHUTTING HIM/HER DOWN by reciting what I just read.

I moved in with my extended family and had a bed room until my Uncle got out of prison and took that room. I spent the first year sleeping on the couch working at a restaurant with nothing to my name due to me not having a storage unit for my belongings after the Immediate family move.

My uncle almost got violent with me on occasions because I wouldn\u2019t acknowledge every single thing he said. He wanted to me to take off my headphones and walk into the kitchen at midnight to talk to him if he entered the room. It was exhausting. \n\nI moved in with a friend for a year after that and started drinking heavily going to parties not acting like myself getting into fights having sex with random girls while staying up all night doing cocaine. I had zero self esteem and felt like I didn\u2019t know who I was anymore. Bar hopping spending whatever dollar I had on that shit and being an asshole.

No debt to my name. I deleted all social media\u2019s besides Reddit and focused more on learning about finances through Dave ramsey. I have more than all the clothes I Need. Got a passport with my \nOl lady and we left the country for the first time to Barbados. Have flown to Florida twice and her family welcomed me in with open arms.\n\nHer uncle and Aunt both passed away last year and it was tough on both of us. Since uncle J and auntie V died I took it upon myself to switch up from going to bars and using drugs to spending time with the 3 kids her aunt and uncle left behind. 1 girl age 9 who we just brought to Florida and she had an absolute blast. Also 2 boys ages 10 n 11 who I just dropped off at football practice bought them all sorts of clothes and shoes bring them to play baseball and teach them how to play and they\u2019re just funner to be around and despite money or materialistic items I\u2019d rather feel as if I\u2019m making 3 kids childhoods worthwhile instead of being selfish and drowning myself in Booze and problems. \n\nI\u2019m no father and I have no kids of my own but I do my best to be a mentor and do right for these kids because that\u2019s what uncle and auntie would\u2019ve wanted.

It came as no surprise after years of childhood sexual, emotional, and verbal abuse and neglect. I've been having a difficult time these past few years, before which was a time of peace. I've been feeling wholly isolated from my world, friends, family, and myself. Before the diagnosis, I've tried several antidepressants after my second suicide attempt and concurrent hospitalization last year, and they only made me more numb and hypervigilant at the same time. I've weened off of the last one, Effexor, and everything is coming back at the same time. I've had a couple fainting spells that I have no clue how long I was unconscious for, along with some other medical issues, and am not allowed to return to work, my escape and chance to feel normal, until I have a followup appointment on the 17th. I want to be able to confide in my friends, but it is always on my mind and it feels like it's all I talk about. I don't think they know what to say half the time, and while their presence is soothing, it makes me feel so disconnected from them. Their lives go on, and I feel like such a burden being stuck in situations with parallels to my traumas. It causes so much pain for everyone. They seem so much more relaxed and happier without me, even though some of them have told me they'd rather sit here with me and the discomfort. They just treat me differently, and it is so lonely. I try to participate in their lives, but it doesnt seem to be warmly recieved. On top of this, my living situation is precarious, having no choice but to move back in with my father, who was a prime contributor to my childhood abuse and neglect. I don't feel like I have a home, and every time I'm there, it's like walking on eggshells. I don't have much of an option as to where I can live, and I want to be somewhere that has space for me and where I am at least familiar with who I share my abode with. I am also trying to build a relationship with someone who I was in a relationship for nearly 3 years that ended last July. He doesn't feel present all the time, but I can't even imagine how much stress and pressure all of this is on him, too. I try to give him his space, but am trying to communicate better about what I am experiencing. It all just seems to weigh him down, and he can be quite cold in response to how emotional I can get. He has tried, to his credit. I'm at the point where I want this relationship to work, and so I need to do something. I want to learn how to be more than the reactions and processes that have been branded into me. I want to be present in my life. I'm tired of feeling cast aside and unworthy of affection and understanding because I can be difficult. I want to feel so much more than what I do now. I'm so tired and don't know what to do. I'm in therapy, and meditate every day. I've lost 70 lbs (to regain 20 of it in a relapse) with an adjusted diet and more exercise. I stay open to what the world has to offer, and try to be excited about the possibilities. It just gets so damn difficult without me even realizing it.

My father left for \"work\" when I was very little. He never texted/called me (on my birthday once a year)or supported us financially. He comes home every 1-2 years for a \"visit\" and it's hell for me. My parents are not married, they don't really get along but they're not split up. I might be wrong for not wanting anything to do with him, for feeling abandoned and hurt. I wanted to have a dad like all my friends but now the deed is done and I want to cut him off. He feels like a stranger to me and I wouldn't say that I \"hate\" him necessarily but sometimes I do. Whenever I try to explain this to my mom she says that he is my dad and that he loves me in \"his way\". Then I start crying and she starts screaming at me to stop because this is not a valid reason. For my birthday we booked a trip to the beach with my family, and now he announced that he's coming in 3 weeks so he's probably going there too. I was really excited but I really don't want to see him ever again, let alone go with him on holiday. My mom makes me feel like it's my fault and that I am doing it for \"attention\" or \"on purpose\". I try to at least tolerate him but I can't. I just remember the times when he once beat me really bad when we were on holiday (the only time but it stuck with me) or when he had s*x with my mother next to me and made me smell his hand after fingering her(I'm sorry, this is really embarrassing but I had to say it because it's what contributed to my feelings of hate). I was little and maybe they think I \"forgot\" or didn't know what's going on. I tell my mom that I can't stand him but never about these reasons. This year I will go to my grandmother while he's at my house and I hope to not be forced to see him. Am I overreacting and just picking and choosing events to hate on them?(I absolutely love my mom but I don't get why she's justifying his behaviour)]. \n\n\nupdate: I now believe that what happened to me was not okay and that I'm justified for feeling like this.

But I\u2019ve seen you set boundaries, I\u2019ve seen you cut out toxic people that were holding you back, I\u2019ve seen you take time for yourself when you really needed it. I don\u2019t think either of us are perfect at this. But you\u2019re important to me and I\u2019m glad you take care of yourself the best you can.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI know it feels like there\u2019s a long way to go, maybe you\u2019re not where you want to be. But please give yourself credit for everything you\u2019re doing right. More people look up to you than you realize, you\u2019ve made a difference in more people\u2019s lives than you realize, and you\u2019re doing more things right than you realize. These were just a few. Thank you for being you. None of us are perfect, but there\u2019s a lot of people who are really glad you\u2019re here.\n\n**Further Reading:** This letter is to my friend Charles, but if you do those 4 things then I\u2019m proud of you too.

I didn't have any help in applying to get in nor anyone or anything to prepare me for uni (I was much behind my peers when I started because I came from a different country). On the other hand, she is representing her country at the int chem olympiad, she got help and mentoring for it, excelling at school, and now has the support needed to get ahead and get into the same uni I was rejected by and excel there too.\n\nI have also struggled with severe body image issues I could never get skinny and just started self harming because of it. On the other hand she has an ED and is extremely skinny. not something I'm proud of, but because I also struggle with mental health I keep thinking why do I have the disorder that makes others hate me instead of the one that makes me skinny/ if I'm feeling suicidal anyway why can't I get skinny like that\n\nIn every way she reminds me of everything I have failed at in life.

My partner who has an avoidant attachment style began to back away and avoid me. He was used to shutting down and saying nothing due to childhood. This behavior continued with slight attempt's to change it but I was to selfish. I admit we both messed up during this time and it took over a few months to a year to notice this all, with slight attempt's and changes here and there. We tried adjusting, but even then it wasn't enough until I hit my realization with the help of my partner. It came full circle to me of how much I had been causing problems, when I thought the whole time it was him. \n\nWhen I hit this realization my first thought was that we needed to break up. I thought that we obviously weren't good for each other and where causing more pain then anything. I hated that I hurt him and he hated that he had hurt me. We didn't want each other to feel that way, but before we could except our fate, but before we could I drove to his house so we could discuss. We made a plan to move forward and I had new things to work on for myself. We knew that more then anything we loved being with each other and always had fun, but that to continue to being together we needed to change things. No relationship is perfect and all of them have struggles, and we knew that we where going to have to face these parts of ourselves at some point and it mine as well be now. \n\nAnd so, we moved forward from there, just before our two year mark. We have only been making progress it seems. I definitely admit that along the way we have had to call each other out, and ourselves out, to put things back in place. We have been more happy then ever before, but we still continue to work on ourselves and together. We will never be perfect but we will always try our best for ourselves and for each other. Our hurts sometimes do stick through from past issues, but together we talk and work forward to heal. \n\nI know many people say I'm young and to enjoy my teenage years, but I am. I don't think I'd rather spend it any other way honestly. I grew up to fast in the home I was raised in, but my partner has only showed me how to live in the moment, how to make more friend's, and how to have fun. He has litarly brought the best out in me and I hope he would say the same. I love him deeply and hope our adventures continue. We have discussed many aspects of life that we want and have a plan for when we get out for school. We are still learning every day and I'm just glad I get to be with him when I learn these things. \n\nI have had to heal a lot of myself. I have gone to theapry, I have written so many lists of behaviors I need to work on, I am trying to meditate, I am thinking more clearly. I am working on myself. \n\nI just hope that people know that things can change and heal. Both my partner and I agree that maybe during that time we did hold on for to long, but honestly are more greatful then anything now that we did. We realize now the behaviors we don't put up with and have placed boundaries. People can change only if they are truly willing to and open to it. Don't wait around for ever for someone to change, but don't attack them on it either, stay calm, open, work together, and love one another.

Sorry for that.\n\nJust a quick background on my relationship with her: we first started dating around 3 or 4 years ago, I broke up with her twice and she got back with me twice. The third time we dated is the period to which I will be referring to in this post.\n\nThe third time we started dating, it went well for the first 5 months or so. I was putting in effort to show her that I had changed from the last time I broke up with her, we were going on dates, hanging out, etc. After those 5 months, my destructive qualities took the forefront once again. I gradually stopped giving her attention, acted like I was tired on days that I actually wasn't so I wouldn't have to talk to her, kept forgetting important things she would tell me, and stopped making attempts to hang out with her. These are not excuses for my shitty behavior, but I also had other external issues that were affecting our relationship, such as my addiction to pron and severe anxiety.\n\nI was always aware of the asshole I was being to her, especially after I tested positive for HSV-1, which I had most likely gotten from my time sleeping around in college during our breakup periods. I never knew I had it until I first developed cold sores about 2 months after we started dating for the third time. I knew it was morally wrong to withhold that information from her, but I was scared of how she would perceive me and the actions she would take. I always tried to avoid her whenever I did have cold sores to prevent her getting it from me, but I knew even without cold sores, I was putting her at risk anytime I kissed her. I think at the time I found out about the herpes, I also felt it was unfair to me that I got it and never knew who it was from, so I tried using that to justify my silence to her. On a movie date we went on, I ordered one drink for the both of us and subconsciously was thinking about the herpes, so I asked if she was okay with sharing one drink, and she jokingly asked if I had herpes. I panicked and lied to her.\n\nI knew that eventually I was going to have to come clean about everything going on with me if I wanted to stay with her, but I never did until she finally got fed up with my complacency and decided to end things; when she did call for the conversation to break up with me, that's when I unloaded everything onto her at once. We went on a walk and she seemed alright when telling me that she wanted to end things, and perhaps she wanted to see if I still cared about the relationship. I told her I knew what a selfish asshole I was being to her, about my pron addiction/anxiety, and she didn't seem too affected by this information, but once I told her about the herpes, the whole tone changed. She asked me to shut up and for the rest of the walk back to her place we didn't talk. When we got back she told me to delete her number and never contact her again before entering her home, leaving me with the most sickening feeling in my stomach that I can still feel while I write this post. Obviously, she blocked me on everything. This all happened just a few days ago.\n\nIt wasn't until after that I truly understood the gravity of the type of person I've been. I realize now more than ever that I have been narcissistic and selfish, not even just to her, but to my family and friends. I only ever cared about what people thought of me, so much so that almost everything I've done in my life has been to please people and receive their attention/validation. While I was dating her, I actually had the mindset of, \"Her, leave me? Yeah right. If anyone would ever leave in this relationship, it would be me.\" I did, twice, and she took me back after breaking her heart twice, yet I still had that mindset even during our third time together.\n\nShe was the most loving, caring and incredible person I ever had the opportunity to get to know and I have cried both days since she ended things because of how I completely trashed our relationship. Do not get me wrong, I am not trying to draw pity from you guys or shift the blame to anyone or anything else; I know that as much pain as I am feeling, she must be feeling 10000 times worse, and all of this pain was brought about my my selfish desires and actions. I know I need to respect her wish for me to never contact her again, but I still have so much to say to her and I'm so regretful on the way I left things. Its not even like I want to beg for her forgiveness or ask for another chance, I just want to be able to try to clean up a little of the enormous mess I made, but maybe even that is my selfish nature coming through.\n\nHow can I ever live with myself knowing the terrible things I did to her? How can I be less selfish and stop ruining the lives of the people closest to me?\n\nI am willing to listen to any advice you guys may have for me, no matter how scathing or raw it may be.

I am 23 years old and during my college life I have been a part of several organizations where I was able to assume certain leadership roles, so I was very excited to take this course (especially since it had been recommended to me by many).  \nI take my classes every Friday and the dynamics of the course are quite strange, I feel that sometimes, under the concept of the course we are forced to put ourselves in situations of uncomfortable silences to take the initiative.  \nA few days ago something similar happened and we were told that we had a few minutes free in which we could do whatever we wanted. I tried to take the initiative and asked if in that free time we could do an ice-breaker dynamic (if the time they were giving us was ok for something like that or if it had another purpose) and the teacher completely misunderstood what I said and started to accuse me of being authoritarian because I was waiting for her \"permission\" to do what I wanted and that since I lacked authority and leadership in front of the others, nobody would want to do something I proposed.  \nIt is important to emphasize that everything she said to me said it in a despotic way and front of the whole class (class by zoom, all with the cameras on). When I heard what she said to me I really felt ashamed because of the public humiliation, and everything would have been \"fine\" if it wasn't for the fact that while the rest participated, she kept comparing me with the rest ( taking me as an example of how a good leader should not act) and kept throwing hints at me.  \nI am a very sensitive person, and when we had our break, I couldn't help but cry a little, I had never felt so humiliated in my college life. When we returned to class I started to feel as if I had lost the respect of the rest, because when the teacher asked questions about what we had learned today, one of my classmates made an example of me about how \"to mobilize people, I must first be a leader\". I think the latter was what hurt me the most because I know and feel that I am not a good leader, but I had never seen myself as an authoritarian person or a person with bad intentions, I feel that I have been unfairly interpreted and it hurts me to think that no matter how hard I try to be the best version of me, I do not achieve it, that makes me feel very frustrated because I feel as if I were a lost cause.  \nWhen I was 15 years old I suffered from such severe depression that I almost took my own life. I remember how I cried every night and it was very painful for me to feel so bad that day that I couldn't sleep either. I am very afraid to think that my mental health is so fragile that I depend on a single mistreatment to collapse.  \nFor a moment I thought I had taken it too personally and I asked my friends if the way I heard it and the tone in which she spoke to me was the way I felt and indeed, they also told me that they were \"shocked\" by the way the teacher treated me.  \nSadly, talking back to the teacher or complaining to the university are options that I have ruled out because I am on a scholarship and can't afford to let the teacher take \"revenge\" on my grades.  \nThe good news is that I only have three classes left, and I wanted to ask for your advice on how I might deal with these next classes:\n\n1. Should I keep quiet and not participate at all so that she doesn't take revenge on some comment of mine (this is the option I am considering the most as I no longer feel comfortable in that class).\n2. Should I continue to participate and play loud music when she wants to tell me something?\n3. Is it normal for such an act to trigger the crisis I felt? (well, I think the obvious answer here is no).\n4. Is what I feel really valid, or am I taking it all too personally?\n\nThank you very much for having made it this far, I want to apologize for the English since it is my second language, I hope you have a great day :)", "title": "How to deal with public humiliation?"}, {"created_utc": 1627803890, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovo0op/the_theory_of_controlled_suffering/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "There is no happiness without a purpose. Purpose has no meaning without a plan. A plan is just a figment of imagination if you do not execute it. Happiness is such a clich\u00e9d word but to actually feel being happy is quite rare. I see mediocrity all around me where cheap sources of instant gratification are promoted to the extent where virtues like patience and discipline have lost all meaning.\n\nFew years ago, I was caught in this conundrum myself. I was just a teenager and felt enjoying and doing whatever you like is how life is meant to be lived. I ate all kind of crap you could eat, watched all the movies and TV series and did whatever I thought would increase my endorphin levels. I may have enjoyed the moment but I was not truly happy.\n\nSooner than later, I realized that just doing the things that make you happy, do not actually make you happy. Just like without knowing pain you can never understand pleasure, doing things that you like just make you numb to the feeling of liking anything. I had many epiphanies and realizations later which I may delve into, in my later posts but the thing which I was clear from the get go is if I actually want to feel good, I need to do the things that I do not like.\n\nI started small, what if I plan to study for two hours and actually study for that duration. For the first few days, I obviously did not, as when you try to venture into something new, there is always the inertia that stops you from doing it and it is fine. We are humans and we are flawed. A week down the line, I again set a plan for studying two hours and the guilt of being such a slacker for not doing it for a week, actually did make me sit and read for the stipulated duration.\n\n Honestly, the pizza that I ate after the two hours had never tasted any better. It is a very small thing, it's not an instagram post that people may like to give your ego a boost but just doing something that you thought you would gives your confidence such a boost and you feel you could conquer the fucking world. I was in my undergrad at that time and slowly I started making more elaborate plans and executing some of them, failing at others. But what you realize is that with time your hit rate keeps improving and you start pulling off even elaborate plans and the quality of your life improves drastically. My grades improved and I was able to land a high paying job in an MNC which could not have been possible if I was leading my life as I was, just for instant gratification.\n\nWhat this whole experience showed me is that if you can control your suffering by doing tasks that help you grow in life, then you are essentially boosting the level of enjoyment that you will get from the activities you like. Freedom does not give you freedom, discipline does. We humans are insignificant when it comes to the power of nature and flow of time but if we think of something and do whatever it takes to accomplish it, our insignificance vanishes and we are powerful beyond imagination.

He just listened like a third party and he cannot fund me because I do not have any goal, I do not know what I am doing, I am just fishing to be able to stay in the U.S.\n\nWhen I came to the US, he started to date a girl who did not get family support. He was the main supporter, almost the one pushing me to the U.S rather than Europe. Of course, I am grateful, just saying that this was his idea/his passion for me since day 1 in my college. I cannot deny the sacrifices, support he has done for me. My dad was almost absent all the time except critisizing my discipline, behavior, hygiene habits, attitude, care of my hair even :D etc.\n\nAfter that girl my brother has dated, he started to blame me of being ingratitude of what I have. I started to randomly cut communication, as the best when he likes that way, and the cruelest if he feels the other way. He started to blame me for the years he invested on me.\n\nSince December, I cut off communication but reached out again. Now he is in a different person, distant, calm but saying old empty words when I am asking for confirmation, want to feel that brother love again. His soul is gone. His love for me is gone. Every trouble I have been going through or telling, he has zero empathy, just cold advice or \\*being realistic\\*. I feel like I lost him as he died while he is alive.\n\nI am good when there is a distance between us right now. This is very surprising but I killed the thing about him inside of him this previous six months. But since last week, I have realized something. When I am showing love to my dog, I am doing the same thing when my brother was showing love/being sweet to me until last summer. I am playing with his paws, I am trying to smell his back of neck like a baby. I am smelling his face. This keeps reminding me the love he gave to me, showed to me with his actions. This is gone. He was always there, almost deciding together when I was giving big decisions. Now he is just nodding.\n\nI am trying to stay in the U.S. instead of going back home. Today, I wanted to ask him because I am scared of this decision. I am not able to pay my rent after september. He just listened, he just said if you cannot fund yourself, then come back. It is your decision. Before, I was telling him everything upsetting me, now the maximum time he is giving is five mins, and it is just my career check. He does not care what is upsetting, hard for me anymore.\n\nIn May, he said that if I have a plan, he is ready to fund me while in the U.S. Now today he is saying that, this is not a plan, you do not have any target, you are not even close to find a job, probably you will not find one or take six months and he cannot fund this. Then he hung up when I lost it when he kept giving other people as an example, as better, role model etc. He is also saying that when he is tring to give advice, I am getting angry. I am close to the growth.\n\nWhen he says these, this really hurts. He has some assumptions but really do not know me. And it feels small to explain or prove myself. Even I do, he is smiling and saying oh come on you know this is not true inside. I am not close to the growth. I am not doing without any goal. I am not depending on someone else' money and it is my plan to live my life like that. He does not know me. But he knew me the best 5 years ago.\n\nShould I push staying here? Maybe he is right?

I was named after Jesus and felt pressured to be like him since I was 5. Catholic guilt amirite. My upbringing played a part too, parents were young and a bit impatient with me. \n\nIn my mind, every action had to be questioned and every act had to be explained. It was just the way I lived for 21 years. Negative self talk filled my everyday thoughts and it killed my confidence in everything. I tried my best to help people since I feel good doing so but fear always took over. The people I helped could tell, my heart was in the right place but I was so scared to mess up that I created this over-selfless persona. My social anxiety also made it hard to talk to people and fear made me feel inauthentic. My fear was so bad that I couldn\u2019t even put some of my favorite songs in my playlist because I was scared of being judged by other people. Even posting this post is firing fear in my brain.\n\nI coped with everything in the book. PMO, endless self sacrifice, constant self bashing, anything to make me feel better. None of it worked. Hell, the constant PMO and NoFap cycle made my mental state WORSE.\n\nFive days ago something \u201cclicked\u201d. I woke up wanted to start living and that this excess negativity had no place in my life. I though it was random, but I now see that I had been putting in solid work for the last year. Meditation, exercise, therapy, Support Groups, Reaching out for help, even scary stuff like telling my parents about my anxiety/depression. I had been doing so much good but my fear and negative mindset never let me see the progress. \n\nNow I see how far I\u2019ve come.\n\nSpiritual growth has been a big help. I was raised Catholic and grew up thinking I was either all in or all out. Left the church when I got to college. I rejoined a month ago. Now, my SO is bisexual so imagining how the church would treat her killed me. I left the Catholic Church again two weeks ago. I\u2019m now much happier practice stuff from all places. I pray to my Saints and God, I use Buddhist meditation practices, I try to live by my vata dosha, and I love exploring the creation of life via science. I\u2019m spiritually fulfilled and I don\u2019t even know what group to put myself in haha. (Half Catholic?)\n\nThis last week has been a blast. I feel so much happier and better about life. It started with simple positive affirmation and motivational . I started pouring my anxious energy from fidgeting into my work. I stopped tracking PMO/NoFap streaks and now focus on staying sober from MO part. I actually listen to others instead of projecting my insecurities. The people in my life saw a change too. They think I\u2019m more confident and sure of myself (I still have a hard time accepting that). The list goes on, y\u2019all get the idea. There\u2019s plenty of anxiety and fear still running in my head but I have the tools and mindset to face and overcome them now.

Something had been wrong for a while due to constant crying and eventually after writing the note, I tried to drown myself.

After January of last year, I found myself staring into a knife drawer and knew at that point, I needed to change or it was over for me. I went on antidepressants for 10 consecutive months and even went to college. I\u2019ve grown a lot over that time and met a ton of great people and yet after May of this year, I had come off anti-depressants cold turkey and went through a mental health crisis, all whilst in a part of a country where I was alone and without my support circle.\n\nI got through it however and it made me realise how strong that I truly can be.

I finished my PhD, and then pursued a post-doctorate hoping if I produced an applicable research that people could use, then I'll be valued. Nope. The only upside was, I was now able to make rent and essentials through the post-doc salary (as opposed to the PhD times).\n\nI questioned what all of this was for. All my work, my time, was hoping to get recognition that I was good at something. Monetary recognition being one of them. At the end of my post-doc, with multiple publications in good journals, all I had was an opportunity to do another 1.5 year post-doc with an annual salary which was \u00a37000 less than than my previous position. \n\nScrew it. I was out of academia. Have just joined the industry and am pissed off, because I didn't research enough before getting into the University. I jumped on an opportunity of PhD, because that's what the \"brilliant\" people did. Because I assumed my supervisor had my best interests in his mind. All lies. Supervisor couldn't care less about my work, he was only in it so he gets free-labour for his spin-out company, and how to make a sellable product. University only cared about if I was paying them their fees. It's all about money!!\n\nI now realise its all about money. Doesn't matter how 'great' my research is, if I don't make money for someone, no one cares. I'm going to try my best to never let myself be in a position where I am almost begging to make rent. Never again. Academia, I'm sure is great for some people, but for me, it was not what it markets itself as...a place of knowledge. BS. If the knowledge is not profitable, no one cares. \n\nIf money is what works, then I'm going for it. Screw \"working for the good of humanity\". I had a plush job earlier, which I left for my PhD, thinking I was going to make a \"difference\", I'm going to go and make my services useful to someone who wants to compensate properly. Who shows appreciation beyond just saying, \"oh that's nice, how can we sell this?\". I don't want to check my bank balance everytime I'm out with my friends, to see how much buying that dinner would set me back by. My skills are valued in the industry. I'm sticking to the industry. For all the promises the University made about establishing me as an \"expert\" in the field, all I got was huge debt and mental illness. It's not worth it. I'm worth more. \n\nI'm taking charge of my own life now, money, health (physical and mental) and time. \n\nThanks for reading my rant.

I want to share five key things that I\u2019ve learned about in regards to making mistakes that have helped transform guilt and shame into self-compassion and resilience!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1\\. You did the best you could at the given time.\n\nYou did the best you could with the tools you had. Your intentions were good and you meant well. Your mistakes probably weren\u2019t malicious. You could\u2019ve only done it this way at the time because the truth of the matter is\u2026\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2\\. You didn\u2019t know then what you know now.\n\nHow could you? You had to go through those mistakes then to learn they were even mistakes. Those mistakes brought you to these realizations. It would\u2019ve been impossible to truly learn and have the lessons resonate as much as they do now if it weren\u2019t for those mistakes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3\\. If you didn\u2019t have these realizations, you\u2019d still be back there.\n\nIsn\u2019t it better to have made those mistakes then rather than 5 or 10 years from now? You now have the advantage of learning and growing more in life. I believe life is going to keep sending us lessons until we learn them. \n\nInstead of thinking about how much you may have messed up or how you wished you had done something different, try practicing gratitude and compassion. You now get to go forward in life as a better person who not only acknowledged their mistakes but used them to become a more well-rounded person. That brings me to four.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4\\. Your mistakes don\u2019t define you.\n\nYou are not the person who made those mistakes, you are the person who has learned. You may have messed up badly but the important piece is where you go from there. The fact that you\u2019re self-aware, consciously working on yourself, and learning from your mistakes shows A LOT about your character. Your strength. Your resilience. Your integrity. Last but not least\u2026\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n5\\. Healing and growing are hard work.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to admit we screwed up. It takes a beautiful amount of courage and honesty to admit our faults to ourselves. We may find that even though we realize certain things and are moving in the right direction, that we may mess up again. Remember that that\u2019s okay!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMistakes are bound to happen. The important thing is what we do next. Life can take us on some hard journeys but it\u2019s usually these journeys that bring the most depth and meaning to our lives!", "title": "So, you\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes in life?

Okay so I\u2019m 23 and i\u2019m still a virgin. I have hooked up with a few guys in the past but I never had sex or even took my pants off while with someone. I was overweight all off my life and lost some weight once I hit 20 but by no means am I thin. Since I lost weight I have a lot of loose skin and it almost affects me more than being overweight did. It\u2019s like a constant reminder of how I let myself get to that point. I even stopped working out.

I know that everyone says that if someone likes you they don\u2019t care what your body looks like, they like you as a person but I just KNOW that when someone sees me naked they will be disgusted.

I did it dropped out literally the last week and was doing 13 hr shifts 6 days a week. Made about 1.8k in 2 weeks and that was enough for a room at my boys place who\u2019s parents moved out.

Again in like three years this is the second time I\u2019m getting envicies from a place it was out of my control the first two times and it was a feeling of impending doom it sucks. I decided to call up my sister and we end up making plans that were successful in getting a new apt under our names. My sister ( who I live with ) is very dependable and trust worthy.

You just always have that faith in your parents you know. But it didn\u2019t end up like that it just hurt I spent my whole life in NYC skated the streets smoked weed in the parks with my friends. Go on wild walks at night I loved NYC. I know a lot of people from different walks of life in my life so far and I really appreciate everyone and everything. And I felt like it was striped away from me. I live in good ole NJ now haha.

I was lost, hopeless, and stuck with a degree in a major I didn\u2019t even want to go into.\n\nI turned my life around when I decided to pursue school a second time and really thought about what I wanted out of life. In the past few months I\u2019ve been working on studying much harder at school (been doing well so far) and limit playing video games (also been doing well, although I kind of relapsed during reading week and am working out a schedule). I realized a big issue in my life was that I\u2019ve never had a consistent sleep schedule (staying up until 3am and waking up past noon) and that I\u2019ve never properly exercised consistently (I eat healthy and do not gain weight but I also don\u2019t have any muscle). My issues sleeping have taken a negative toll on my life. I constantly feel tired everyday, even after I sleep 10 hours, most likely because of the messed up schedule. I also feel like I never have enough time in the day to study and play, and it leads me to staying up later every time, continuing this cycle. I also have a bad addiction to my phone (only at night) so it prevents me from being able to sleep.\n\n\n\nMy goals for 6 months:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor the next 6 months, I want to really work on those two things, and continue the good habits I have developed in regards to studying and limiting video games. I will be doing light, at-home workouts everyday (less than 30 min), with 1-2 days break a week so I can feel healthier and hopefully be tired at night. My sleep schedule, I want to work hard to fix. I will try taking melatonin an hour or so before I want to sleep, and I will leave my phone away from my bedroom during this time since I find the biggest issue is my scrolling addiction at bed time. I am also looking at getting an ebook reader to possibly replace my scrolling habit in favour of reading an hour before bed.\n\n6 months is my time frame since I will be making a major move, and I would like to have healthy habits set in place to help with the transition. I am also currently on a skincare routine that will be showing significant results after 6 months, so hopefully I\u2019ll have a full proper glow up before the end of 2021! (I want to make a video of my before and after progress to document everything and motivate me to keep going :))\n\nIf you read all of this then thank you! I will be editing this thread and hopefully making a follow up thread in 6 months.\n\n\nProgress:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u2705 Day 1 - light arm weights and leg exercises", "title": "Day 1 of improving my physical and mental health (sleep hygiene and exercise)"}, {"created_utc": 1614462860, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lty8x8/i_want_to_go_to_a_dermatologist_and_i_also_want/", "num_comments": 9, "score": 3, "selftext": "I want to go to a dermatologist so I can get my dream of nice , clean and clear skin.

I did counseling for a few years but it got less and less effective until I got clinically diagnosed with MDD and Panic Disorder when I was 22. It took a good six months and being on the brink of a breakdown (which I did indeed eventually end up hospitalized over) to get me on medication.\n\n\nAnd it worked. I did end up having that breakdown but the medicine helped keep me level and that's what let me accept some sort of help and get hospitalized in the end. I stayed for 5 days, got the section cleared, and went home.\n\n\nThe first full month was hard. It was so hard. The medicine was working but not without its costs until I had enough in my system to make those side effects mostly go away. That took another 2 months. And then things were fine for a year and I decided I didn't need help anymore and went off my medicine. And it was fine for another 6 months.\n\n\nThen one day I stopped eating and my weight and appearance and food was my life for a year. I lost a bunch of weight as a result and I felt good about it. It was toxic though and I had toxic family/friends who encouraged it because all they saw was me \"getting healthy\".\n\n\nThen I met the love of my life. I hid it from him, the not eating and obsessive behaviors I had. Eventually I broke down because I couldn't avoid eating around him and gained some weight. It took another 8 months for me to get back in counseling because I thought I could do it on my own. I'd been in counseling for so long and I picked up things so quickly that I didn't see the point until I realized I was getting worse and I didn't want to put that on my partner. I needed to get better if not for me then for him.\n\n\nSo I started counseling but the physical symptoms of my depression came back. The constant fatigue, the day long bouts of disassociation, the constant anxiety and racing thoughts, the mood swings, the crying and that deep hole that just seems to grow every day. My counselor suggested medication or at least blood work as a starting point. It took another 2 months and a week of constantly bursting into tears for no reason for me to admit I needed my medication. I finally made the appointment and got a prescription for my old dosage of sertraline.\n\n\nLast night was the first dose and I'm struggling. I feel weak for having to go back on medication. I understand that it's a matter of brain chemistry and my body needs a little help to retain its serotonin. I understand that the dizzyness and stomach cramps will go away in 4-5 weeks. I understand that me not being able to drink is probably a good thing anyways. I know good times are on the horizon and have an excellent support system this time, way better than the last. I still feel that sting though. I've always tried to do everything by myself and pride myself on that. But pride has gotten me nowhere and I need to put it aside no matter how much my ego stings. I just can't do it all on my own and I need to accept that.\n\n\nSo here's to day one of this rollercoaster. I'm dizzy and mildly upset but it'll get better.

Feelings don\u2019t really work like that, though, do they? \n\nWhile you can\u2019t choose your feelings, you can choose your actions. This is important because if you want positive feelings, you can create them with positive actions. \n\nYou want examples? I have examples:\n\n* To feel calm and relaxed, listen to short guided meditations on YouTube.\n* To feel strong and healthy each morning, do pushups or other simple bodyweight exercises for a few minutes.\n* To feel a sense of purpose and connection, volunteer your time. \n* To feel active, take a walk at lunch to stretch your legs.\n* To feel clear and more aware of your emotions, journal when you\u2019re upset.\n\nYou can choose actions that will make you feel good. You\u2019ve done this before. Can you think of a time you felt great and productive after getting a lot done? And don\u2019t come at me with the \u201cI hate journaling\u201d or \u201cI hate exercise\u201d excuses. I do, too. And it\u2019s even worse because I\u2019ve done this enough that I KNOW I can feel better as soon as I do those things. \n\nThat is what this is about. Small actions that taste bad can create big feelings that taste great. Said another way:\n\n\"Comfort is not the *first step* to growing as a person; it is the *result* of that growth.\"\n\n*Dis*comfort is the first step towards growth, and that\u2019s okay. If good actions create good feelings, then the time you need good actions the most is when you feel awful. \n\nGood actions are the rope you can use to pull yourself back to safety when life ruins your day. Too many people are waiting right now to start that positive change. They\u2019re thinking they need certain shoes to start running, or that they need to feel completely prepared to try something new. \n\nDo me a favor and imprint these onto your brain:\n\n* You don\u2019t have to feel cheerful to get things done.\n* You don\u2019t have to feel ready to try something new.\n* You don\u2019t have to be brilliant to attempt a rough draft.\n* You don\u2019t have to feel emotionally strong to look up therapy exercises or journal out your feelings.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do these things well. You just have to do it, and you will feel better after. \n\nI\u2019m just asking you to work on the stuff you can control. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever sobbed while staring into a mirror and wished that you didn\u2019t feel so broken or worthless, but those are not feelings you can just wish away. Again, we don\u2019t get to choose our feelings, but we can choose good actions that create good feelings, and we can create good habits that we use every day. No, it won\u2019t make life perfect but I can promise you that taking these steps will make life better. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to start small.\n\n**Set Small Goals**\n\nSmall is simple, simple is consistent, and consistency is power.\n\nStart small and take the absolute smallest positive action that you know you can accomplish. Make your bed every day as soon as you get out of it. Go for a short walk every day. Write down one sentence of something you\u2019re grateful for. You can do something small like these every day, and those actions will continuously create positive emotions that begin to change your life. You want to get to a place where you do this on autopilot so you have good habits to lean on when you need them.\n\n**Create Good Habits**\n\nGood habits should be opt-out, not opt-in.\n\nIf you can create routines of positive actions that you do every day regardless of how you\u2019re feeling, then dark days will be much easier to manage. Not that you have to go for a morning walk if there\u2019s a blizzard outside, but it\u2019s better to do good things by default than try to start a new habit when you feel terrible. Having a variety of these habits will help when it\u2019s impossible to execute something on any given day.\n\nYour happiness baseline will be MUCH HIGHER by doing positive things on autopilot, and the more you get used to them, the less willpower it takes to continue. You\u2019ll do them because you want to, because you know how they make you feel. And you can add to them or adapt as you learn what works for you. Optimize it for whatever makes you feel the best and help you continue growing as a person.\n\nYou can choose actions right now that will create the feelings you want, and you can turn them into habits that give you those positive feelings every day. Feeling bad today is not an excuse \u2013 it is actually a reason to get started. \n\nYou can create good feelings by choosing good actions. What are you waiting for?\n\n\\------------\n\nFurther Reading\n\nIf this resonated with you, then I highly recommend *Miracle Morning* by Hal Elrod. That book changed my life by showing me how much better my life was when I traded a little extra time on reddit in the morning for actually doing things that made me feel better. The quality of my life has been so much higher just because I get a \u201cpositivity injection\u201d in the morning regardless of how I felt the day before or if I woke up feeling negative. It illustrates the power of choosing what feelings we want to create, and the book has great systems and advice and ideas for how to make a positive routine you can maintain. There\u2019s also a very supportive community of people all making these positive changes together and encouraging each other\u2026want to join them?", "title": "Good Actions Create Good Feelings"}, {"created_utc": 1614426377, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltmh2q/constant_stress_has_taken_control_of_who_i_am/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 4, "selftext": "At one point I feel like I was a very emotionally regulated and in control person.

It all started last August when I caught my boyfriend cheating on me with one of our friends. Since then I controlled all of his social medias and we only had one app where we talked and I didn\u2019t want him to use any social media because it triggered my anxiety and I felt like he if he saw any woman on there he would instantly leave me for them. I was very open about how I felt about it so he deleted all his socials except for Facebook and Youtube. Eventually, he got tired of dealing with my bullshit and left. Our relationship wasn\u2019t healthy at all because obviously I was abusive and my ex tolerated me because he thought that he deserved it for what he did. Also, I read in one of his conversations with his friend that he misses the girl and would like sleep with her. This sparked our last argument that eventually made him break up with me, but his reason at the time was that he is tired of me and never admitted to what I read. I accepted this because it is true that I have become a monster. Two days passed, then I found out that he is talking to the girl he cheated on me with, so I messaged the girl about the conversation that I saw. My ex got extremely mad at me for ruining his image and told me that he is never speaking to me again.\n\nI don\u2019t want to blame my ex for the things he did that pushed me to become abusive and controlling. I want to be accountable for what I did and change. I don\u2019t even like hearing my friends say that he is a bad person. I should\u2019ve healed myself first before accepting him back into the relationship. I didn\u2019t know that my feelings are my responsibility and how I react to things afterwards are my responsibility. My mindset at the time was that my ex had to gain my trust back by treating me special and agreeing to everything I want. \n\nIt has only been a week but I think I have made major progress. I have an appointment to a psychiatrist next Tuesday to hopefully fix this and all of my other issues. I have also started meditating and I am getting back on reading. I have been scouring the internet for tips on how to change my behavior and be better but all that shows up is tips for the abused people. So if anyone has any tips, I would really really appreciate it.\n\nRight now, I just want to focus on how to make things better. I am also looking for ways I can help my ex heal because I certainly do not want him to suffer the same trauma that I did.\n\nLastly, I just want to express that I feel guilty for being sad, like I don\u2019t deserve to be sad because I was abusive. But at the same time I feel like I\u2019ve been left behind because I am still hurting for what he did to me and now that he\u2019s getting back with the girl it feels like he is just pressing on old wounds.

We both are bisexual, pale short girls with long curly red hair and hazel eyes. We look very similar, except for that she is quite underweight and I'm not.\nEver since my boyfriend has expressed interest in her romantically, I can't handle being around her. Being around her gives me extreme anxiety and afterward I feel so insecure it hurts. It feels like she is effortlessly cute while I have to try really hard- despite the fact that my boyfriend says I am cuter than her. \n\nIt's giving me more body issues than I already had, especially since she is the type to wear revealing clothing wherever she goes (and looks great!) and while I'm skinny and wear mostly size small, I don't quite have the body to pull off that kind of stuff without looking skanky or feeling uncomfortable. She can pull off revealing clothing and still somehow look great, not trashy. Here's the kicker: she's insecure too. We've both gone through bouts of body dysmorphia. \n\nI've always had trouble making good friends and hadn't found a good one for about 4 years (social anxiety). Finally this girl comes by and is a really amazing friend and it all came crashing down after 9 months when my boyfriend says he has a crush on her. I'm almost afraid to go make other female friends now. I unintentionally started self isolating. \n\nI said no, I didn't want a thruple and I thought our relationship by itself was perfect how it was. It took him a few weeks to accept that it wasn't going to happen (he didn't understand why I wouldn't want to, with us both being bisexual, and sometimes joke-flirting with eachother, but just because I'm bi doesn't mean I want to date multiple people at once). He said he would try to forget his feelings for her. It hasn't happened entirely yet but he is working on it. \n\nI never thought this situation would happen to us and was not prepared. He always seemed like the most loyal person ever. Now I feel like old news, like I am boring even though he denies it. I can't help but think he wanted a thruple because he wanted something new and exciting even though he claims it's because \"she balances us out\". (Which I don't entirely agree with...) \n\nAnyway he says my anxiety and insecurity about the subject has been a \"constant stress\" on him and is \"making our relationship worse\". He says he knows that there are types of people who wouldn't let this sort of thing get to them so much, especially when he said he would try to give up on it. \nHe says I need to find some way to find security in myself, and stop comparing myself to her. I have a slight underdeveloped sense of self so I unfortunately rely on other people for reassurance because my brain doesn't seem capable of reassuring itself- (what do I know, I could be wrong, and then I don't want to reassure myself of something that is not true). Other people's opinions of myself matter to me almost too much. \n\nI want to learn how to be that confident girl who isn't afraid of being replaced, abandoned, lost or alone. I know this type of girl will come off more attractive than the \"what's wrong with me\" girl anyway. I just can't seem to get there. Every time she is brought up I feel jealous and inadequate.

I'm now only 4 runs away from completing it!

I've lived here for the past 10 years of my life, having emigrated from a poorer part of Europe. \nFor a while, I thought I was doing quite well in terms of \"living\" and \"adulting\" - handled and completed higher degrees, found jobs, got through several moves across and between countries, handled getting married and divorced and still done kinda okay.\n\nFor a while now, at least a couple of years, I haven't felt like I am doing too great...  I thought that by setting goals to advance beyond my starting baseline would help me feel better about myself, feel pride in my achievements and make life feel like its worth living. But I haven't felt that in ages. If anything, most aspects of my life look horrid from where I am standing.\n\nI once had a passion - my work and education. I've lost that about 4 years after I got my PhD. \nI am lucky to have had a job ever since I finished my PhD, but now the energy that kept me going in face of academic and office politics, energy which stemmed from curiosity and desire to find out new things and also teach people, has dissappeared. If anything I think it's all a sham and even within this \"masquarade\" I am not good, intelligent, knowleadgeable enough, nor do i feel like I have a voice. Also I do not have great relationships with my co-workers. I always thought that by being nice and smiling, saying good things to people, would win me kudos. But actually, perhaps I just come across as aloof and strange. I have no idea if people generally dislike me, feel indifferent to me etc... the only advice I keep getting is that I shouldn't care but... I also cannot live in a bubble not knowing whether I offend people or push them away unwillingly. And maybe I don't but I still fail terribly at making any meaningful connections.\n\nI thought that by diversifiying my social networks I'd feel more enriched by people's stories, experiences and would provide both a source of potential friendships and new, diverse activities. But after multiple tries, I gave up searching and trying....I only have my partner's friends to rely on (which I do regard as primarily his!), I haven't kept proper contact with my old friends (due to having to focus a lot on work for me to still have a job!) and I don't think they actually ever liked me. I tried rekindling old relationships frequently, but 90% I only speak to people if I initiate... And then I get forgotten.  Also, so much time has passed that I've lost touch with people's lifes and them with mine. So interactions are simply polite and out of politeness, when anyone has a bit of a free pocket of time to fill it (i.e. I would not have the courage to ask any of my friends to actively help with a house move or anything too onerous because that sort of closeness has never been there and it is less so nowadays).\n\nMy family life is not great either. I take comfort and I am grateful for my fiance's family for accepting me. I have 2 family members close by - my mother doesn't really like me and I have felt rather comfortable on the Nmother threads on reddit. I am still trying to please her to feel accepted and despite that plus LC, things are not getting better so I am workimg actively on helping myself accept the bad situation for what it is. \nMy only other family member who I cherish highly is understandibly too busy with their own family and worries, hence too tired for connection. I haven't seen this person in at least 10months and last time we spoke on a videochat was around March. Again, just like with the friends situation - we kinda lost touch with each others lifes.\n\nI havent enjoyed many things in many months, but I am constantly trying to \"do better\" and drag myself towards some goal. I continue to take medication for anx and depression. I have 2 therapists (one for past trauma and one for potential, self-diagnosed ASD). Drink alcohol socially once, max twice a week, without going overboard (given it could screw up my mood even more).  I have put on a lot of weight so I am trying to calorie count and get myself back into an exercise routine. But it all feels bleak. Ill do it, expend my entire energy/spoons for a day and then just want to go to bed at 9 and be on my own. If I could just not have to get out of bed at all and speak to no one at all that would be great... but also sad. Where is my energy and will to \"live\"? My motivation for anything at all.\n\nI feel lucky to have a partner who loves and cherishes me and who still wants to marry me. It feels like the sole comfort I currently have in what seems otherwise like a void life. I cannot really see a happy or at least content future, with my having kids, a nice house etc. I hate the thought that the way I feel right now might drive him away too, which would leave me utterly alone, as I have been before. But I am almost willing to accept that too, Id rather he were happy than miserable like myself.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am not sure tbh what my problem is or even where to start to make it better. But I do want to do better - surely, not everyone feels like this. Where to I start? Does anyone have any good advice for me? \n\nIn short: All aspects of my life feel bleak and void despite efforts. I dont know why my life feels so broken and I don't know how to fix the parts that are indeed broken. I have 1 good thing going for me and I fear that my current mood, low energy and lack of motivation will drive this 1 good thing away also. In dire need of advice.

The young elephant will not be strong enough to break free from that chain; it would struggle, pull, and attempt to break free.  This would go on, as necessary, but once it gave up, that was when the trainer had confidence that escape was no longer something the elephant would attempt. Once the elephant stops fighting it\u2019s learned, and now believed, that it\u2019s not strong enough to break free and abandons escape. \n\nFast forward: little elephant is now a big elephant. Still though, once it gets the chain around its neck, it believes it can\u2019t break free, for this is the belief that it\u2019s lived under its whole life. Why try anything new despite the reality that it is now a strong and capable elephant, one that could break that chain that has kept it limited? \n\nBeliefs are just something that we have thought repeatedly to the point we think it is fact. \n\nWhat beliefs do you hold to be true but maybe need some challenging now?  Like the elephant that can break that chain in its more mature state, what chain can you break through and leave behind? Maybe it\u2019s:\n\n\\-I\u2019ll never lose the weight\n\n\\-I\u2019ll never be forgiven\n\n\\-I\u2019ll never be able to start a business\n\n\\-I\u2019ll never break my addiction\n\n\\-I\u2019ll always be defined by my past\n\n\\-I\u2019ll never get good grades\n\nStop and look again.  Is that chain holding you back the same one that was put on you when you weren\u2019t as strong, mature, wise, or were in a different chapter? Is that chain as strong as you think, as the truth you\u2019ve come to believe?  \n\nTake back these beliefs and work to change them.  Don\u2019t be afraid of the inner negative talk that will stop you from challenging that chain: \u201cit\u2019s too strong; tried this before; I don\u2019t need to change; everything is fine the way it is,\u201d when truly you\u2019re looking for something beyond where you currently are.\n\nDecide to challenge the limiting beliefs you\u2019ve come to tell yourself. What you see as truth is not necessarily still true, you can do what you dream of.

I have always been a good student so there are no issues academically that I'm worried about\n\nBetween about 2019-Feb 2021, I had virtually no close friends, and would spend my time away from school playing video games. I had online social interaction as I was in a very large discord community that all played the same game, and I was part of a \"league\" for this game, so I presume that's what distracted me and almost became my primary world rather than the real world. Because of my huge preoccupation with this video game community, I had put no care into my fashion, appearance, social life, etc. Just grinding school and video games\n\nIn February of 2021 I started having mental health issues/anxiety about my future that basically came out of nowhere. I did a lot of self-reflection about myself, and, while most of it was negative and put me in a very dark place for several months, I am definitely now on the upside as I transition into the next phase of my life. Over the last 4-5 months, I have greatly improved my physical appearance (working out often), fashion/style, and social skills (although I'm still a bit shy, I don't have too much social anxiety as I once did).\n\nOne thing that makes me insecure, however, is my lack of a social life. Given the situation with COVID, I really haven't been able to interact with a lot of people my age on a regular basis since March of 2020, and even then I was barely interacting with people. Between March 2020 to about March 2021, I virtually had no connection with people from my school except during August - October 2020 when I was on my school's golf team.\n\nVirtually the entire summer up until a few days ago, I worked a full-time job. However, my work environment was small, only about 6 of us, and the youngest apart from me was in her mid-20's. While I had a pretty good relationship, and became friends with my co-workers, nothing translated to outside of work and I have not talked to them since my last day last week (I have no way to anyways). I do think this job definitely helped my social skills and reduced my shyness to an extent, but there's still a lot of work I can do in that department. Though, I get that it's pretty normal for someone my age to be shy and awkward.\n\nAlso, this summer, I hung out with some of my friends on four different occasions. During summer 2019 and summer 2020, i pretty much never hung out with friends. I realized that I was not awkward at all among my friends and we could have great conversations and have a great time hanging out. This made me realize that at my core, I'm actually pretty extroverted and love talking to people/hanging out all the time. My shyness and mild social anxiety just kind of holds me back from actively pursuing it.\n\nIn college however, I am pretty grateful to have a fresh start. So far, I have already met a few people through social media, including my roommate, and have had a handful of conversations with them. Though, I still find myself comparing myself to others and feeling bad about myself because I see others on Snapchat hanging out and talking to friends all the time, while I am not, even though I secretly wish I was.\n\nI have also been pretty insecure about my lack of experience with girls and relationships. Prior to the last few months, I probably couldn't hold a conversation with a girl for too long without it being very awkward and me being very shy. However, now I do believe I definitely can as a lot of my anxiety has faded away. Like I said before, I still got work to do, but I've definitely made large leaps from where I used to be and I feel almost like a new person in some regards. Though, i still feel insecure about never having a girlfriend, never having had sex, etc. I had a kiss when I was either 9 or 10 but back then I was just a kid with no real cares or insecurities.\n\nDuring the last few months though, I definitely look a lot better and I know that if I wasn't shy at all, I could definitely attract and get in a relationship. If I had to judge my appearance, just physically, I would probably give myself a 7.5 or 8 out of 10.  \nIf anyone wants, DM me and I can show you before and after pictures of what I look like\n\nSo to summarize, I'm basically just looking for advice on how to break out of my shell and put myself out there in college. I have a really good opportunity and have met a handful of people already through social media and I don't want to mess this up. I know that myself at my core is someone who loves to socialize and talk to people, but I just don't want my shyness or anxiety to hold me back.\n\nTLDR: Former extremely shy, ugly kid who has made large personal growth in the last few months, and is now looking to have a great time at college and have a fun social life, even though they are still a little bit shy and socially anxious", "title": "Advice for going to college and putting myself out there"}, {"created_utc": 1629238349, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p6dua8/how_to_continue_conversations_with_people_ive/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m great at meeting new people.

I spent a decade of my life imprisoned by my enemy. However, I didn't drown in fear and anxiety. This experience helped me to create the Philosophy of Changes (Yijing).\n\nThe years of guessing - \"will I be executed tomorrow or not\" - helped me to train the ability to confront uncertainty.\n\nAccording to the Philosophy of Changes, human exists between heaven and earth, in the area of changes, which are stages on the way to perfection, to the Truth, which in the Eastern philosophy named Dao\n\nThere is a key to deal with uncertainty in this teaching that you can try - being conscious. Cherish the past, plan the future, but focus on the present.  \n\n\nHow to apply it to your life?  \n\n\n**- Be conscious about every second**  \n\n\nDon\\`t mix up awareness with productivity or broad control. Being conscious means honestly asking yourself and honestly answering to yourself.  \n\n\nWhat and why am I thinking of just now?\n\nWhat and why am I feeling just now?\n\nWhat and why am I doing just now?  \n\n\nIf you skipped those questions, I encourage you to return and answer all three right now. Don't wait for an \u2018appropriate\u2019 moment.\n\nDon't be shy or embarrassed about your inner or outer state - there is no one here except you. You feel awkward because of the side glance from the stranger in the metro? It's okay. You overthink the misprints you did in the formal letter to your client? It's fine. You're laying on the sofa and read this lesson? Amazing.\n\nThe first step on the path of change is accepting. And you just made this step.\n\nStay connected with the world. And the world starts with your surrounding.  \n\n\n**- Connect with nature**  \n\n\nCome to the window, open it, and sense - the wind, the heat, the sounds, the colors.\n\nNotice the changes around, watch and see the movement. The Philosophy of Changes says: \u201cLook around - nature renews, seasons change, but there is no place for uncertainty or rupture.\u201d  \n\n\n**- Connect with people**  \n\n\nRemember, how often did you take people around you for granted? And how often did you regret it later? The Philosophy of Changes teaches us: \u201cManifest the Dao in kindness to mankind, maintain it in your actions.\u201d\n\nMake a call.  \nShare something helpful.  \n\n\nNow, as you did these three exercises, you made a great step toward a better version of yourself. You had a chance to increase awareness, connect with nature and people.\n\nYou can't imagine how it may change your life in the future.\n\nThe Philosophy of Changes teaches us that uncertainty is an essential part of the Universe, which comes from changes. Try to practice the exercises every time it recalls, and become more and more conscious about your life. Once it becomes a habit, you will ask yourself automatically, your awareness will be your armour, your sieves of truth.\n\nChanges are irreversible so deciding how to live with them and learn from them is necessary.  \n\n\nStay strong! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.

It started pre pandemic and then really took off during the two months I had no responsibilities but staying home. I delved deeper into the bottle than I ever had, I used other even more dangerous substances during that time because I was bored and I could. I started treating people I care about like dog shit I became manipulative I became hurtful and I didn't realize what I was doing until it became too late. \n\nI had to go back to work on like three days notice when my state opened up and damn was that I wake up call. From being under the influence of a variety of things 24/7 to having to be sober for long stretches gave me a lot of time to think and look back in horror at the person I had become at the beginning of 2020. That part was hard enough, but the part that really screwed with my head was that I had always been that way. Not as severe, but I always had the streaks of selfishness and self destruction they were just more well hidden. I looked at a lot of situations from the 5-10 years prior to 2020 and saw that I couldn't write off my actions as exceptions they had become the rule.\n\nThis realization fucked me up a little bit. I had always viewed myself as a caring person, someone who would do anything for the people he loved. And to a degree that was true. I do care, and I always would give the shirt off my back to someone in need. But the one thing I never did to help the people I loved was be the best version of myself. I felt so much guilt that I spent the next year wallowing in my sorrows and basically shutting myself off from the world. Minimizing the harm I could do to anyone. I gained 60 lbs, developed an actual physical dependency on alcohol and sleep aids. I gave more of myself to people than was responsible, I enabled friends and families bad behaviors because after realizing how much I sucked for so long I felt like the only way to make up for it was to do everything for them. This created a wicked codependency I'm trying to dig myself out of. During the last year I skipped my car payments to help my friends pay rent. I spent thousands of dollars on my friends and family over the last year not because I wanted to but because in a warped way it made me feel better about being a jerk for so long. I realized Generosity is good but when you are damaging yourself to cover for your friends issues just to console yourself it's not altruism. It's toxic and unhealthy. \n\nThere were many times the past 18 months I stood in the mirror crying and yelling at myself berating myself for the person I am and the person I was. I said some pretty horrific things to myself. As the title suggests I don't think anything I experienced during the last year was healthy or good. I didn't need to become a total asshole, if I had seen the warning signs years ago I could have sought help and fixed these before it blew up but in someways I'm grateful that I did have a blow up because the life I was leading before I melted down was unfulfilling and broken and if I had had just stayed at the same level of destruction I had been at I probably could have gone on 30+ years and been fine but I would have burned bridges I would have hurt people and I eventually would have ended up totally alone and rightfully so. \n\nThis takes me to the last few months. One day I woke up and felt just enough energy to do something and the energy was gonna be used to either off myself or improve. So I called my doctor and set up an appointment got put back on my ADHD medicine which allowed me to be stay focused on my goal of getting better. I started eating healthier, expressing gratitude to the people I loved. I even got a therapist to help me get to the bottom of why I acted the way I did and he helped me tremendously deal with some childhood  trauma that manifested itself as insecurity and selfishness. In that time frame things that would normally trigger me lashing out in unhealthy ways triggered genuine human emotions. I have severe abandonment issues so when friends or I move away I often treat them like garbage because I feel bad. In the past two months I've had three of my closest friends move far away and each one I told them that while I'm sad they are leaving I'm happy they are pursuing their dreams and I'm thankful for the time we shared. The best part it wasn't fake, this is how I've always felt about that stuff but normally I let the intrusive thoughts take over and say something shitty about them leaving me.\n\n\nThe progress has been slow, it actually stalled out a little while ago and after a couple false starts I talked to my doctor about anti depressants to help with the crippling anxiety I've felt for so long and they seem to be really working. I'm more clear headed than I've ever been I see what actions I can take to improve the lives of people I care about and what actions would hurt them and I always choose the improve option now. \n\n\nI still struggle with the weight of who I was. I don't think I'll ever fully forgive myself but I'm working on moving on. I apologize if this is rambling, I just looked in the mirror this morning and didn't hate the person I saw and it's been a long time since I could say that.\n\n\n\n\nTldr; BIG FUCK ups made me realize that I was always on a bad path.

Allow me to elaborate.\n\nI am a teenage girl into her late teens and I have had a crush on various boys ever since I was 9. I noticed a pattern was that I'd fall out of love if I knew they liked me back and suddenly get annoyed by all the attention I received from them, but I'd feel miserable if I knew that the boy did not hold any feelings towards me.\n\nRecently, a boy has developed feelings for me after I have pursued him for a few months. I still think that the \"crush\" feeling is there but I think it is fading fast. However, I do cherish him as a really great friend or person, and I guess to some extent I just want validation that this relationship is \"the one\". I know - I'm young and there's a lot of time ahead of me, but the problem is the boy doesn't know about my current feelings. \n\nHe has always told me that if I don't like him anymore (he and I both have low self esteem), I am to tell him honestly. Thing is, I don't want to lose this friendship (because I still... like him? I think? The English language needs a word for this) because I still do care about him. But I am so scared that I have been leading him on and I don't want to hurt him if this is the case.\n\nAlso, I hate that I do this. This isn't the first time and I've chastised and chided myself for this. I don't understand why I feel this way, chasing a boy then not loving him anymore, but I need a way to genuinely love someone and not just enjoy the dopamine. I do have a budding social circle and many friends, and so far I've barely had problems with keeping those relationships (but then again, it could be because they are around me all the time). They ship me and this boy but they don't know we actually like each other, but I do think some of the pressure is getting to me.\n\nWell, sorry for the long one. I'm hoping for some advice that could quell my worries - maybe validation. I've tried to be as honest as possible here so that it may be as accurate as possible, but I don't see a solution right now. \n\nThank you everyone.", "title": "I fall out of love every time I know the boy likes me back and I hate this.

I want to be better. I really do.\n\nMy problem: I kept recurring flashbacks of being bullied and a petty incident at McDonalds which make me angry! (More elaboration below) It makes me have angry faces, scream out tics that are racial slurs (which I understand is wrong but why does my mouth say things?), and start punching the wall, sofa, mirrors, and air.\n\nBackground: growing up as a kid with immigrant parents I had language barriers. I could not develop social skills, and elementary school kids were mean to me because I was ethnically different. Therefore I never had friends and I was so awkward and weird. I suffered from depression and loneliness as a little kid. Parents were always working rather than bonding with me.\n\nIn middle school I got bullied because I never had elementary school friends. I got physically bullied and verbally bullied. In high school, I got physically bullied and beaten up too for being so annoying. I also got verbally harassed by my teachers too. They wouldn\u2019t believe me. They also called me annoying to my face and killed my self esteem.\n\nIn college, I didn\u2019t get physically bullied. People thought I was annoying and avoided me. They also spread rumors about me too and told the incoming freshman not to be my friends.\n\nThus I developed lots of PTSD and depression and anxiety.\n\nIn my first job, I made a bad first impression for being lazy and unfocused. I couldn\u2019t listen and do the work because I couldn\u2019t focus (ADD/ADHD). I also have OCD when I was a kid and I always wanted things to be perfect - lines needed to be straight, constantly looking up and down to see if something was there, and always running back to make sure my door was locked 10x (OCD). The flashback to the petty McDonalds incident was also described as a compulsion in the OCD.\n\nEven tho I didn\u2019t have good friends or a good relationship with my parents, my boss Dave was my biggest inspiration and father figure. He actually sat down with me, communicated with me, actually wished me success, and was fair with punishment and disciplined. He actually wanted me to grow and he noticed my behavioral issues, and sent me to therapy instead of firing me. He was great. He gave me so many second chances.\n\nEventually, I was fired from work because people spread false rooms that I was using drugs and pushing drugs at work. This wasn\u2019t even true. I hate when people spread rumors about me. It started with coworkers joking that I looked like I was on drugs. Then eventually people and rumors spread and it grew into the grapevine. People went from he\u2019s \u201cprobably a drug user and seller\u201d to he\u2019s \u201cactually a drug user.\u201d It was such BS. I never did drugs, drink coffee, drink alcohol, or smoke. Dave didn\u2019t fire me. Dave\u2019s boss Ross fired because many people complained. I think about Dave everyday. He was such a great man, a great boss, and patient and kind church loving man.\n\nI am just hyperactive and stupid. The hyperactivity, fidgeting, jumping around (not metaphorically- literally jumping and skipping around) are results of ADD/ADHD.\n\nAfter all of this stress, i decided to apply to graduate school. I got accepted, during my wait time from 1 month of getting the acceptance letter to the first day of school- I went to McDonald\u2019s.\n\nSo in my 1 month of free time, I was at McDonald\u2019s- a quiet day as normal until I sat down in an empty seat. All of a sudden a man (from the X race) came and invaded my personal space. He started touching my shoulders and demanding that I move from the seat. He wanted to sit down on it. He was so annoying that I got up and left anyway. I moved on with my life. The McDonald\u2019s incident was 10 minutes. It was annoying and stupid. I thought I could move on as and adult. But for some reason, my brain is fixated on this memory for more than 1.5 years now.....\n\nI went back to grad school, and I couldn\u2019t focused. All the online lectures flew over my head. Even after I rewatched the recorded lectures 2 times, I still couldn\u2019t focus or absorb the material. I was also having traumatic flashbacks of being physically bullied in middle and high school. I also got flashbacks about the 10 minute McDonald\u2019s incident.... I started to curse the F word! I started to unintentionally say tics with racial slurs about the X race.... it was so messed up and I don\u2019t know why.\n\nMy compassionate boss Dave was also from the X race, and yet why was I saying racist things about X race in response to the Mcdoanlds flashback?\n\nIt\u2019s so petty and dumb. I also say the racial X slur to flashback memories of bullies who aren\u2019t even in Race X. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nSo my psychiatrist diagnosed me with ADD/ADHD and PTSD after a 5 Hour long assessment and history and evaluation. She then prescribed Zoloft which didn\u2019t work. And then she prescribed Wellbutrin which somewhat worked in helping me focused on my online classes in the Covid pandemic. However I still suffer from the racial tics and physically fitting the environment.\n\nMy issue is: I still get mad, flashbacks, and I still remember the 10 minute mcdoanlds incident and start punching and fighting the walls, sofa, mirrors, and start screaming racial slurs!!!! Sometimes there aren\u2019t even triggers. I could be alone in bed, chair, or walking. And my PTSD/IED would explode on the memories and flashbacks. Then all of a sudden, I\u2019m screaming and punching.\n\nWhat do I do? How I can stop my ptsd? How can I stop my mouth from unintentionally screaming racial slurs? I\u2019m so scared. During online classes, my camera and mic are off so no one could see my body automatically going into rage mode without any triggers.\n\nNow my classes are going back in-person classes and I\u2019m worried that my OCS/PTSD/IED will get out of my control, I\u2019ll unintentionally scream out racial slurs, and I\u2019ll start punching the desk and air randomly and uncontrollably. I don\u2019t want the grad school to think I\u2019m crazy and kick me out of grad school. I also don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m a racist when I\u2019m not.\n\nI have tried magic mushrooms. They didn\u2019t work, I tried 3 large dosages in different occasions. I went on many hallucination trips. I still was not cured. And I stared ticking racial slurs and physically hitting the environment for no reason.\n\nI tried 10 mg of street MDMA because I because the FDA have some clinical trials where molly could cure PTSD. The one pill was good that it made me calm and not go on ptsd rage for 3 days.....\n\nUnfortunately i can\u2019t find any street Molly since I can\u2019t find anyone to sell me. Also street molly is dangerous since I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be pure.\n\nHow can I stop my ptsd and outbursts, unintentional racial screams, and fighting?", "title": "I\u2019ve been diagnosed with PTSD, OCD, IED, depression, anxiety, and ADHD.

Our mother is also the owner/boss of the business. So my entire work/family/ life is completely enmeshed and has been very damaging. I won't bored you with the details, but suffice to say I was suicidal last night and tried to do better by tell my therapist (something I normally wouldn't do for fear of cause unnecessary worry and stress). \n\nShe felt very concerned and encouraged me to call our local crisis resource and meet for an assessment for some intensive care to get me away from my triggering environment for a little while.

Whether it was by my father, who played favorites with me and my brother due to hair and eye color. My eyes and hair didn't match what he wanted, so I was put under my brother. Or to the more literal side of my foster mother locking me up in the basement storage room for days on end with little to eat or drink. Even beyond childhood when I tried so hard to break the cycle of abuse that I was born into. Every attempt found me under the waves of uncertainty, self fulfilling prophecies and abandonment. It never seemed to matter what I did nor how much effort I put in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 38 years old and I have nothing to show for those years. No job, no formal education, no family of my own. All of it seemingly robbed away by the outside world or by my own vicious mind. To say my mind is vicious towards me is an understatement to say the least. Only the few who really get to know me ever get to see it when it kicks into high gear, right at the climax of a relationship usually. Though not always.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI led my life pursuing my emotions mostly, because I never really knew any better. Nobody was there to teach me those things and even if they were, I'm certain I would have still followed the same path. Given how hardheaded I can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the last 2 and a half years, after a break up that tore me to shreds. A relationship in which was the first that I allowed myself to actually be open. The first time I wasn't giving into mistrust and jealousy. In prior relationships i would constantly accuse my partner of cheating on a daily basis if not more. In this relationship, I had changed. I never once accused her of anything. For me that was an extremely beautiful moment to realize that I could be alright, that I didn't have to always be so distrustful. That I could change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, it came to an end because she could not stop lying to me. She tried to blame it on me and how sensitive I am and how hard that made me to love. I understand she was being apathetic, ignorant and purposefully trying to cause me harm to doubt myself. She succeeded in that for the following years later. Up until maybe a month or so ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believed everything she said because it was words I have grown so familiar to hearing. I had heard those words, or some iteration of those words all my life. How could I not believe her? That goes without saying that of course I would believe her, I put all my trust into her, into us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBroken, I began to pursue psychology in an effort to figure out what was wrong with me and how I could go about fixing it. For two and a half years I submerged myself into my own mind and began self analyzing based on the information I had read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe answers never came, but suggestions did. Suggestions that were often very hard to find or difficult to see. But I managed somehow. Still, it wasn't enough. I was doing all this research and I had all this information but I just couldn't break myself out of my hole. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hole suddenly wasn't just about the break up anymore. It was about everything, all of it. All my regrets, all my emotional scars, all the pain I've endured, everything I lost, why and how most of it made no sense. It just was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I met my current therapist and on our third or fourth session, she put a new piece of information into my head that started getting the gears turning. She told me something along the lines of \"when we're trying to learn a new behavior, we expect to get it right all the time. But what if you looked at it like you were learning a new language?\" Perplexed, I looked up at her sideways, still hunched over in agonizing emotional distress. She continued \"you wouldn't expect to learn a new language right off the bat, would you?\" And I shook my head \"no\". She followed up with the gem that made everything suddenly make sense \"that's why we have to practice, so we can get better at talking in that new language\" and she didn't know it but right at that moment, my brain had fired off one thought that tied it all neatly together. Love is factually a language. We have several psychological studies that verify everyone has a specific love language. Why wouldn't self love be the same? The answer was simple, it us the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe concept or notion of practice was never something that was instilled in me. Even though I was in the military, it never was something that stuck with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis aspect allowed me to begin caring for myself, for my body. Yet it still wasn't enough to get me entirely out of my hole. That came from a concept that I had developed based on cognitive attitudes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn cognitive attitudes there are 8 specific attitudes. One of those 8 is something referred to as a tertiary attitude, sometimes referred to as the \"child function\". Hold that bit of information in mind while I turn to the part that brought this all together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was watching a Tedtalk about anger, specifically rage. Because I have a TON of inner rage towards myself and there's some aspects of that that are based on people I've lost and things I never got to experience because my existence had just been that cold. Like love, I have yet to experience what a healthy form of love feels like and I'm 38 years old. That's a pretty good reason to be extremely angry with existence, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this woman is talking about how rage comes out of us, physically and emotionally. Then she gets to a point where she refers to it as a sort of car model. Wait a minute! Jungian theory also talks about a sort of car model! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe begins to describe how the anger is like that 10 year old child in the backseat and sometimes that little, angry child gets into the driver seat. Boom! The car model for Jungian theory states that our child function is likely around the age of 8-12. With our inferior function being an infant, no older than 5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's the connection my brain made and then she started describing why we feel that anger. It's because a boundary had been crossed or we failed to set a boundary and our inner child got hurt as a result. So of course there's going to be anger involved! When you get hurt, it's very natural to become combative, right? It's part of evolution after all, which goes beyond just our human race. That is true for every living creature. When wounded, they go into fight or flight mode and most of them with fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I understand! That's why I'm so angry. I still hadn't been putting up boundaries of any kind. I've began putting some boundaries in place but just like with self love, it takes practice to learn where to set those boundaries. Sometimes it's not always easy because we don't always know the intentions of others and often times, you won't know a boundary is needed or has been crossed until the first time you have that negative experience. Which kind of answers the question \"which came first, the chicken or the egg?\" Sure we can preemptively set boundaries but you'll still never know they've been crossed until you experience that discomfort first hand in the vast majority of cases. Life isn't ideal after all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd with that information in hand, I began focusing on trying to really care for myself. Not just physically but emotionally as well. I started asking myself what it was I truly wanted to experience because I know there is so much more than everything I've lived through. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat doesn't make it easy though, even as much as I know what I want to do now. It is still extremely difficult to make headway and I know the reason why. I have a lot of fear in leaving the comfort of this little rut I've dug for myself. The outside world is chaotic, unpredictable and full of every possibility both good and bad. While in here, it's not so chaotic. But there is a trade off. Inside here, the answers never change either, nor do the outcomes. It is always failure by default because I refuse to even try. So I know the negatives of living the way I have and I'm slowly working my way towards the light. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet I find this to be the most difficult battle I've fought. Even I don't know which side of me is going to win. Will I keep being lethargic and allowing life to just slip by? Or will I be courageous enough to brave that bright light and open myself to all the possibilities? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to believe I'll choose the latter, when the time comes and so long as I keep moving forward, it's ok if I come back from time to time.

You think and regret about the mistakes in your past, you think and worry about your future and you think and worry about your current situation and where you are in life when compared to your circle of friends.  \nThere should be some way to stop these futile thoughts, to somehow control the emotions that gush forth with no practical implications that are positive. You do some research and find that meditation is the answer to your problems.  \nWow.. now you can become the wise old guru of the mountains with answers to life and its problems. So you decide to get started right away. You dig some more on the internet and come up with plenty of websites that talk about meditation. There are plenty of apps, websites, videos etc and you finally zero in on a handful that look promising.  \nIn most of the instruction videos, you notice that the meditation guru has a serene setup before the meditation even starts \u2014 a yoga mat, incense sticks, posters, meditation clothes, beads, pendants, candles and whatnot. This matches with the image that you commonly associate with anyone doing meditation, thanks to the picture portrayed in most movies about meditation.  \nYou decide that you definitely need to buy all this \u201cbasic\u201d stuff to even get started and you spend many hours surfing for the best meditation articles and products.  \nStop.  \nI am going to now take the liberty and assume that you have at some point in your life been in a state of complete focus while working on a task. It could be anything like vacuuming, walking to the store, going for a run, playing a game or even reading an article on meditation which is what you are doing right now. I sometimes go on a run or ride my bike. At some point in the run, I notice my breath going in and out of my body, I look down at the pavement and am mesmerized by the odd patterns of the pavement tiles or when running on the road, by the little stones wedged together by the concrete making patterns that I never knew existed. When I am in a train and I look out the window, I am hypnotized by the different shapes of the buildings that zip past me or the varied landscape. Even when I am reading something like how are you doing now, you notice how some random letters bunched together are able to make meaningful sentences and ideas.  \nStop.  \nYou are now meditating.  \nYes, even at that fleeting moment, when your mind was focusing on these tiny things, you were meditating. This is mindfulness meditation at its practical best.  \nDispel all your thoughts about meditation and trying to become the meditation guru. The purpose of meditation is to bring your focus on the present and that is what you have achieved in the above examples. You don\u2019t need that expensive meditation mat, that scented candle, that dedicated time to meditate. Sometimes you cannot afford the money or the time.  \nMeditate when you go about your daily tasks. At any time, all the time. Stop a moment while you read this to notice your breath. If you are like most people, you are taking very short breaths in and out. As you read this line, take a deep breath in and a deep breath out.\n\nRepeat 3 times..\n\nDeep breath in\u2026 and out.\n\nBreathe in \u2026 and out..\n\nBreathe in \u2026 and out.\n\nGet back to your regular breathing pattern.  \nCongratulations you have completed your first meditation practice.  \nMeditation is all about the present moment.  \nSeize the moment and seize the day!  \nCarpe momentum..

My story will be a bit long so I apologize. Today I turn 28, and it is very common for my daily routine to have these tides from the past that generally overflow with sadness. I gain strength and do my exercises stronger, I look back and, although the tears fall, I continue to concentrate on the present.\n\nI have loved a woman, what will we call D, even now, for many years.  Almost husband and wife, a beautiful relationship of almost 5 years that ended very badly. She was my best friend. All started very slowly. We met at a conference where I gave a lecture. We started to go out, we became friends, and over time we grew to like each other. From the beginning I undressed myself with my defects and virtues, hoping that from past experiences, I would not make the same mistakes. I thought she had done the same. But she spoke words that I will never forget. \n\n&gt;When you find out who I am, and you will go.\n\nD had a beautiful personality, I considered her as the sun of my life, since I am the opposite (an Introvert). But that does not mean that I was happy on my own before I met her, everything was going very well. Over time I understood that it was the love of my life, we planned so many things and shared so many dreams that now it seems that I was fooling myself into pursuing the same dreams alone. I got to know her very well, well enough to know that she was carrying a sadness from far behind, which never wanted to heal, despite the fact that financial support was not a problem and I wanted to disguise everything as couples therapy.\n\nCurrently, I work as a professor at a university (head of laboratory practices). Since the virus arrived, my work tripled to the point that I rarely had the time to chat with her or watch a movie via zoom or google meet. Logically, our carnal desire was also even greater, but we could not satisfy it more than in a virtual way. We were unable to move together precisely because of the pandemic. So the relationship was like this for almost the last year. She can't quite understand it, so she thought she was being left alone. She also couldn't stand his family, and the only consolation that I could give her was that I would always be there for her whenever she needed me. Eventually, living with herself led (for a long time) her to take distance from everyone and tell me even I have time, she must tell me something. We had seen each other a couple of times before that, in reality it all happened in a month, and since the beginning of 2020, I had had a wedding ring forged that had written in Braille:\n\n&gt;Even if the storms come, I know that if I'm your side we will overcome them together\n\nSo on the day he had met me, I was going to propose to her.\n\nTo summarise, that same day she ended the relationship with many excuses, they were very confusing, but I understood that she wanted to be alone. So I agreed, I kept the ring, and I was talking with her how much fun we had during those years. I recived a call in that moment, my grandmother was entering the hospital for Covid, so I told her and left. Before I left she had confessed to me that she tried to commit suicide in the time that I did not know her, I thanked her for how brave she had been for telling me, I hugged her and told her that I would always be there for her, only if she wanted it. That day, was probably the saddest day of my life, my beloved left me, my relatives began to fall one by one to the virus, and only I was left. \n\nI spent days going to the hospital and feeling very unhappy, I constantly felt that it would be best to end everything. But every time I remembered my family (my grandmother, mother, aunt, uncle and cousin) I understood that I still couldn't afford such a luxury. If I disappeared, they would have the least chance of surviving the virus, since someone who is not hospitalized is always needed. I got psychological help as quickly as I could, to overcome the duel and the crisis that I was facing. I started to exercise, to motivate myself and not let be defeated by anything, by the way, to prevent my thoughts from defeating, to have a stronger mind as well. Several months passed.\n\nLife sometimes plays in strange ways. My cell phone was stolen and I had to go back to the cell phone I used when I was with D. An old message that was never sent, that day it was sent to Discord and we started talking again. We agreed to meet. I had overcome the pain, I did not hold a grudge and still loved her very much. Not knowing why we broke up, I decided to win her back, what I saw was not pretty. I saw her thin, I could feel her ribs, she didn't eat well and all the time she said that I was better off without her. Immediately, I remembered her last words and began to hang out  more often in order to help her get out of the hole. Then the second attempt came, and his relatives finally found out about her illness. ***She has chronic dysthymia***, started therapy and also began to develop a very narcissistic and selfish personality that maybe she had been asleep all the time.\n\nI spent all my savings on my relatives and on her, I helped her in a modeling career on Instagram,  with makeup, I learned basically everything since cero, I thought in this way as a method upon which she would improve her self-esteem. Every time I had a chance I would tell her to go out, maybe play something like \"just dance\", go for a walk, watch a movie or talk about fun things. I understood her situation and for a long time I thought that she did not insist on seeing me because of her illness. Then, she began to force changes in his personality and beliefs. First, she is bisexual and a feminist, but somehow, she created a sexual account somewhere and got a Sugar Daddy, practically betrayed the ideology of selling herself to some stranger and tried to convince myself that it was a good idea. I've known her for so many years, not for nothing, but I knew that she didn't even believe it herself. In addition, doing this went against her therapy, I told her that if she needed financial support I could give it to her, it was not necessary to do these things and that I did not judge her, but apparently she continued to do so. Her depression increased.\n\nBefore everything was ruined. We went out to a boardwalk in our city. She said she loved me, but because of her condition she still can't be with me, since she wants to give all of her to me. I replied that if that is what she can give me, it is because it is everything and it is a lot, that it is not necessary to give great things for the relationship to work, just be honest and never keep things as hard as what she is going through right now. Normally, we consume our love whenever we see each other, but it was not just sex, it was deep conversations about life, our dreams, goals and the things we would have together once everything is solved. The final day arrived.\n\nAll happened in one day. First, she made me wait about four hours, without even answering my calls, an ugly mania that she always had. When she finally arrived, I saw her very badly, I couldn't even articulate coherent words (the meds I thought), and sometimes she looked at me as if we were talking, but it really wasn't like that, so as not to make her feel bad I kept asking her things while she answered me with her gaze. I asked her better to go home and see us another day, but she didn't want to. Then, for someone reason she showed me her TikTok account in which she reply to \"Four words that women like to say\" with \"I also like girls\". Also, showed me other videos talking about handsome tiktokers and that she hopes they are of legal age. Inconsistencies, I did not consider her immature to do this kind of thing either, but apparently she thought it would not affect me, it was very random and uncomfortable. I'll ask for the second time to go home with me, but she threw a tantrum, and then almost passed out. When I was about to call her mother, she asked me to please not do it, because they would not let her go out anymore. She told me to go somewhere that she needed to rest, so I took her to a hotel and she was sleeping for hours.\n\nAll was very confusing, I feel guilty because I knew I should have taken her home, but I was also afraid that her mother would forbid me to go out with her. Between the hours that she was sleeping, she had many nightmares in which asked for help and water. I helped bring down her fever with wet towels from the hotel. While hugging her, she pushed me once, She was already a little awake and I asked her why she rejected me like that. She could not answer anything. But asked:\n\n&gt;Why you love me?\n\nWhen I started to answer her, she apparently couldn't hear me, her glance directed at the sheets, only she pay me attention when I did say a few words:\n\n&gt;... This is why I am afraid to lost you again, because you are not telling me nothing else, it feels like you are being involved emotionally with new persons in TikTok and Instagram ... but ...\n\nIt was at that moment that she unleashed all her rage against me, among all the insults she gave me were: \"You are selfish, insensitive, you don't care about me.\" She pushed me with such force that ripped some of the flesh off my forearm. As much as I tried to calm her down, she kept attacking me with words. I haven't had an asthmatic attack in years and at that moment I felt like dying. When everything was calmer, she asked me to make love, then we would talk these things later. When we were in our homes, She told me that I was irresponsible for not taking her home, that she had blackouts and she remembers very little of the things that happened. I played along. Currently, I take it as a great excuse to justify her behavior that day. She rejected me twice after that, On February 14 I wrote her a farewell letter, which she surely did not understand, and for which she only thanked. She persisted in the conversation until a delayed gift arrived days later. And since then I don't know anything about her, she hasn't spoken to me, yet. Today It is my birthday, and she hasn't even said hello to me, I would like to end everything here. I think I helped her enough, but she does not love me, nor does she value me.  I recently met her sister, and she told me that last year (which was when we broke up), D told her that we broke up because I had no decision-making power and didn't know what I wanted with my life... A lie ... basically she has lied to avoid the fatigue of being asked of us, if she prefers to invent anything, rather than do justice to me, to us, I think those 5 years did not mean anything to her.\n\nI am going to translate this whole story into a book, which bears the title of the post. How much I have suffered this time. How today I threw the wedding ring in the nearby lake where we had our first kiss. I keep fighting not to have those thoughts of ending it all. I want to see how far I can go, and I feel like maybe someone reading this could benefit from this. Sorry if it was too long, I hope someone can read it.

Left my whole life behind over night. But why? Well.. When I was in hs my mom was crazy and mentally traumatized me. I have issues to this day over it. She was very controlling and mentally abusive. She also had many health problems and was sick so used it as an advantage and made me look like the bad guy. I couldn't have a job, I couldn't see my friends, she just wanted me home with her. Needless to say, I'm very socially awkward due to this, funny I became a barber right? It helps me talk to people and come out of my shell. Great career to reverse.. Well, the damage. I was very fit before my mom totally lost her mind and destroyed my life. But that was over when I got depressed, fat, and addicted to smoking weed daily. Also smoked cigarettes every day.

Well, now that I'm in AZ I've quit eating meat (I was a vegetarian in hs but also have that up) (I'm a giant animal lover so feel guilty when I eat meat) I've caved a few times but in really trying and I'm just happy I'm doing as good as I have even though I need to stop occasionally giving in. I just started going to the gym every morning, trying to lose these man tits and get jacked again. I'm also starting at a new school soon to finish my hours. Basically, I'm not there yet.. But I'm closer than I've been in years. It's been so long since I've felt this good. I still smoke pot, to be honest it's just a coping mechanism I'm not ready to part with yet. Hopefully when the time comes. I just really want to be healthy and happy and take care of my body again. It's been so long but this slight progress I guess just gave me hope for the first time. It's a long road but I'm just so blessed to have the ability to get back to my old self even though it requires lots of work and discipline I haven't fully gained back yet.

To put it into context, I was a very talented dancer but struggled with a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders, along with some childhood trauma. I come from a mixed race lower middle class family that was always on the fence about letting me pursue dance. My father didn't see it as a wise career choice for a male, and my mom was tired of covering the bills and tuition for so many years after my dad left us.\n\nFast forward to high school graduation, I had no idea what to do. I'm from Canada so taking a year off after high school is common. I ended up taking two years off of high school continuing my dance training in hopes to prepare myself to audition for prestigious schools in the US. One summer I attended a dance convention in NYC that was giving out college scholarships to selective participants. Even though I wasn't a part of the competition aspect of the convention, I attended the college scholarship audition and walked away with 3 scholarships and additional money from the convention.\n\nI end up at a great liberal arts school in NYC to major in dance at 19. Those 4 years at school were some of the best and worst years of my life. I struggled extremely hard with anxiety, depression, financial hardships, bulimia and so much more. I could barely stay awake and focus on my academic classes after I woke up extra early to get to the gym and also pushed myself too hard in my technique classes that were scheduled before academics in the afternoon and evening. I can't believe I'm writing this about myself, but I was one of the top dancers in my class. I was always praised for my technique but encouraged to bring out my personality in my dancing. Little did my professors know that I was hurting so deeply inside, which made it so difficult to even know who I was and how to express that in my dancing. I managed to pull myself through the 4 years with terrible coping mechanisms such as alcohol abuse, starvation, and having to use my physical body to pay my bills. My parents didn't know how expensive it was to live here and we've always just done the bare minimum to get by. Being around my rich friends, I couldn't dare open up to them about all of my struggles and how I was dealing with them.\n\nAnyway, I ended up graduating, which I am still surprised I made it there. I left school with no prospective dance jobs, as many do in this industry, but mostly because I had no idea how to network and put myself out there during college. I was way too focused on making it through. I ended up taking on work at fitness studios around NYC in exchange for free classes- I was still very focused on my body image and now that I wasn't dancing hours a day, I needed some other physical activity. I dedicated myself to receptionist and administrative work that I deeply hated while I watched my friends slowly enter the dance world. I worked extremely hard at these jobs and went above and beyond to prove myself. I thought if I couldn't pursue the dreams I had, then I better be the best at the most simple tasks. I developed some decent relationships and my employers spoke of me highly, but I had absolutely no desire to be sitting at a desk in a fitness studio managing rude clients from uptown NYC. I spent the majority of the year after I graduated finally earning some money, working on my mental health, and navigating through adulthood. Before I knew it, I realized that I had not done enough dance work in order to apply for an artist visa. I was devastated. How could I have gone from the dancer who worked so damn hard, spent years commuting to studios on public transit, begged for my parents and grandmother to put me through private school in NYC, had so much potential just fail like that...\n\nI only had 1 year on my student visa after I graduated and by the time I contacted lawyers to see if it was possible for me to work on an artist visa, I was essentially told that I wasted my time in NYC. I ended up moving back to Toronto in the summer of 2019. I was completely heartbroken, angry, sad, and all of the other depressing feelings. I managed to get a part time receptionist job at a hair salon near my house at a lower hourly wage than I was making in NYC. At that time, I was so deep in my depression. I thought things just kept getting worse and worse for me. By the end of 2019, I couldn't take it so as the avoidant person in me would do, I booked a one way train ticket to Vancouver. I thought this was my time to find myself again. I would move across that country and run away from my problems and start new. I could tap into my inner nature lover alt style self and settle in the PNW. Of course I realized as soon as I got there that I had no idea where I was going to live ( I was able to stay at a friends place for 3 weeks as he was out of town) or where I was going to work. I had no friends other than the one who rented his place to me- we were not very close, but rather just acquaintances from years ago.\n\nI fell into old habits of \"comfortability\" and ended up at the front desk of another fitness studio. Shifts started at 5:45 am and I would wake up at 3:30 so I could leave at 4:30 and walk across the city and think about my life and my failures and how I got to this place. This would continue for weeks. I thought that I could really unpack the choices I made in the past and start to look at them as lessons. I always knew I wanted to go back to school again. I wanted to redeem myself from not putting in more effort into my academics during undergrad since I was so focused on so many other issues. I also knew that if I wanted to live in NYC again, I would have to either apply to school or talk about marriage with my partner who still lived in nyc, and our relationship wasn't in a great place as we were long distance and this was the start of the pandemic. I started to use those early morning walks to think about my passions and values. I thought that I wanted to become a food journalist to shed light on eating disorders, veganism, and wellness in the dance industry. I got a job at the local food co-op that I figured would be an interesting experience that could help me with my application. I put together an application for NYU Food Studies MA and was accepted to my surprise. This was so validating to me. I could have never imagined being accepted to NYU. I had so many doubts about my academic voice, and to make things more interesting, I didn't even formally apply to schools for my undergrad, I was just accepted based on my dancing at the summer audition.\n\nI was on cloud 9 for a while until I realized that there was no way my family could afford to pay for that school. As the pandemic became more and more serious, I realized I would feel terrible trying to reconnect with my absent father who I only speak with 3-5 times a year to ask him to cosign a line of credit for me as so many of us were losing jobs. At this moment I realized food journalism wasn't my passion. I didn't want to risk trying to get private loans in the US or moving to another country in this time of uncertainty in addition to bizarre policies being put in place by Trump, which ended up affecting many international students in the US. I deferred my admission with hopes in the back of my mind that covid would ease up by 2021 and I would have time to apply for scholarships and such. Neither of those happened, and by June of 2021, I was exhausted. I found myself in a similar place that I was when I was working in NYC\u2014 I was going way above and beyond at the food co-op to prove that I was capable of doing things. I craved validation so much. This cycle was toxic for me. I would start jobs, put forth so much effort to prove myself, begin to feel extreme anxiety if I made one mistake, start to think negatively about myself and the job position, and then quit. I told myself that I would move home to Toronto after only 6 or so months in Vancouver to be closer to family during the pandemic when the reality was that I could handle things in my life.\n\nI found a tiny basement apartment in Toronto that I paid for with unemployment because the family home that I grew up in was too small to accommodate me. I spent my days dreaming about moving back to NYC and distracting myself with online fitness classes and such. I came to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I contacted my doctor and they started me on antidepressants. Some of my general anxiety and depression eased, but I was still so frustrated with my life/career journey and wanted to do something about it. For the rest of 2020 and 2021 until this point I have lived in NYC with my partner. We are making things \"work\" for now as we find comfort in each other during the pandemic. We spend our days hanging out with our roommates dog and just exploring nyc like we used to. This time is different though because I am staying at his apartment rent free and he is supporting me with many things such as groceries or dinner and drinks. It's like I'm almost at the place where I want to be, yet so far. I want to have my own place and return back to NYC on my own terms, not relying on someone else, which ends up with deep feelings of guilt.\n\nI've been spending countless hours browsing grad programs, writing in grad admissions forums to see if anyone knows an affordable program for someone with a BFA interested in dance, fashion, culture, and community. I could not find anything that would suit me. There are so many programs in NYC, but it felt like none of them connected to me and that I would end up going into even more debt for something that I am not committed to just so that I could move back. I finally came across a program at Pratt the other that is extremely interesting to me. I found out that they are still accepting applications on their website so I emailed them to confirm. I was scheduled for an informal interview, which happened yesterday that I feel like I bombed due to my social anxiety, and poor vocabulary. The man was really nice and to be honest, I don't think that he judged me that hard. I think my inner saboteur/imposter syndrome can easily take over. For some reason I feel good about this program. I feel like it is the first and only grad program that is right for me. I feel like despite all of the hardships and struggles I am currently facing, I am in such a better place than I was last year, or even a couple of months ago. I guess I'm scared to believe that there is a chance that I will get accepted, and even if I do, I am terrified that I won't receive enough funding to make it happen, but something deep inside is telling me this is the right path for me. It's hard to describe and perhaps I'm just a little out of touch with reality, but it's almost like I can see this happening for me. For anyone that has made it to this point, thank you for making it through these messy thoughts and feelings. I just really needed to get this off of my chest. I don't think I am looking for answers or anything, but I hope someone out there can relate!\n\n**TL;DR I am a 27 year old washed up dancer from Canada who once was on the right path but fell off track. I've faced some hardships and obstacles that have set me back, but I recognize the lessons that made me who I am today. I am ready and eager for my comeback moment and hope to move back to NYC soon.**", "title": "I feel like a huge failure. From talented dancer to insecure 27 year old.

It was in-person and they even paid for me to take a covid screening before entering their facility.  I met with a panel of 5 engineers and they hit me with their toughest technical questions, and fundamentally I aced it.  Eight years of experience were rolling off my tongue.\n\nThen came the solder proficiency test.  There was one engineer there who was skeptical in nature, asking me some off-schedule questions which implied doubt.  He pointed to the smallest, hardest reach component on a circuit board and asked me to rework it.  To his credit, he did help me adjust the microscope, which was nice.\n\nI was at an unfamiliar workstation, and these components are really really small, very densely populated.  I was nervous going into the interview about the solder proficiency test and my anxiety didn't fail to deliver:  My sponge was not wetted and therefore the solder tip would not stay clean and therefore the solder just wasn't flowing for me.  My mask was fogging up my glasses impairing my vision, there was no brush to remove debris, I didn't have any familiar equipment, and like I said, the solder just wasn't flowing for me today.\n\nIt was kind of embarasing, sitting their fumbling with the part in my tweezers under a microscope while everyone waited for a result.  It took way too long but I completed the first and second test, barely, and certainly not up to standard.  At least one of the engineers was sympathetic, pointing out my technical knowledge and stating something positive at the end of it all.\n\nBut I knew I botched it.\n\nDang if only I had requested to wet the sponge before I began! \n\nThis whole thing brings up feelings for me, going back to middle school, when the teacher had to pull the test out of my hands while I struggled to finish on time.  And then I ended up a ritalin kid.. \n\nThere are two ways I could interpret this.  One: Maybe I just need to work a little harder at my weaknesses and I am just steps away from being the best damn technician in los angeles.  Two:  Maybe I am meant for something more than assembling tiny parts in a laboratory in an industry that is, by necessity, unforgivingly perfectionist, and it is time to consider what the next decade of my life ought to be.\n\nI am disappointed in my performance today but there is a silver lining:  We learn more from our failures than we ever will from playing it safe.\n\nCan't tell you what it is that I learned, but maybe it will reveal itself in time.\n\nMaybe I had invested a lot of hope into this opportunity that it might propel me into a happier phase of my life, and maybe happiness is my own responsibility.\n\nI want to say that I am grateful.

However, simply knowing this truth most of the time is not enough to make us act on it. It seems too abstact. Our attention inevitably shifts to more flashy but unimportant things which can't bring us real fulfillment and sense of accomplishment. This makes us procrastinating on our deepest desires and goals. I've recently read a book written by Marcel Proust where he provided a very simple but striking question to help us to reflect on this truth and always keep it concrete in mind. I wanted to share it with you and framed from his perspective. Wish a good read!\n\nHello! I am Marcell Proust, a French writer and thinker. I wrote the famous series of novels \"In Search of Lost Time\", and that's the theme we will cover today.\n\nThe value of time is, of course, a tricky topic to discuss. But since you are here to learn how to use your time more efficiently, I have a few practical exercises.\n\nWhat would you do today if you had an additional minute?\n\nJust one minute. 24:01 instead of 24:00. It seems that it's so tiny\u2014a drop in the sea.\n\nHowever, would you reject it when given a choice? Probably not.\n\nIf you want to know the price of one minute, ask the son who missed his flight and was late to arrive home when she was dying on her bed.\n\nOr the boy who is waiting for a girl on a date, being unsure whether she would come or not. For him, this one minute is eternity.\n\n**What would you do today if you had an additional minute in your day?**\n\nIf we learn to value the minutes of our lives and think about spending them wisely, we will build an overall healthy attitude to our time.\n\nNow, think of what would you do today if you had an additional hour?\n\nOh, that's far better\u201425 hours instead of 24. And now multiply it by every day for the next decades you will live on this Earth. Well, it's a lot of time now.\n\nYou'd probably want to spend this time on your passion, the thing you always didn't have time for as you were busy working or doing some other stuff but always wanted to do. Maybe that's another hour reading your favorite novels, or playing with your kids, or doing some team sport with your friends, or simply walking in the park and enjoying nature?\n\nMany people would say that, but not so many would fit it into their existing 24-hour life. So why would you postpone it? If it's something you want to do anyway, isn't it possible to find that one additional hour by reducing the time you spend on some other less enjoyable activities?\n\n**So what would you do today if you had that additional hour?**\n\nP.S. If you liked this exercise, I have written more lessons like that. Just in case you\u00a0**are curious to explore more**, let me know and I will share **the** **other lessons**\u00a0in DM.\n\nThe themes I cover are:\u00a0getting disciplined, reducing anxiety, learning about your life values, decision-making, the art of happiness, and being present in the moment.\n\nThe lessons are based on the primary sources of wisdom from more than\u00a02500 years of history of philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, Lao Tzu, Carl Jung, Stoics, and many others.", "title": "How to stop taking life for granted and never forget how priceless is our time"}, {"created_utc": 1621346045, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nfbavz/i_am_leaving_a_toxic_relationship_to_stay_with_my/", "num_comments": 13, "score": 1, "selftext": "In the past year and a half I've (28F) let my entire life fall apart due to binge drinking and being in a relationship with a fellow alcoholic.

If not, can you point me to the right subreddit?\n\nSo, on Thursday, May 13th, I had a massive fight with my only friend. I said some absolutely horrible things because I was stressed out with money and my motorcycle and other stuff, and I needed to blow off some steam.\n\nI took it out on her. It was just a phone call.\n\nShe was and still is the most important and amazing person I've ever met.\n\nI was also angry at her because I was feeling ignored and neglected. But I failed to take into account her own mental health. I was selfish and cruel, and I will regret what I said for the rest of my life.\n\nShe blocked my number, my Instagram, my Snapchat, and my Epic Games account.\n\nThen on Friday, less than 36 hours later, I got called in for 2 job interviews, and I got some money I was waiting for. I paid for my motorcycle insurance, and as of today (Monday), I got both jobs.\n\nI like fixing and building things. I'm good at it, too. I can fix most things if I put my heart into it. I'm really good at puzzles, too. I used to build them all the time. People are puzzles. And I like helping people. I fell in love with this woman. And she is one of the most complex people I've ever come across. I think I might the most complex person I've ever met.\n\nHer birthday is in about 50 days, and I've been writing her an apology letter and ordered 24 tulips for her. I think I'll try and change the order tomorrow and have the flowers delivered to her place, as well as 7 roses. We were friends for 7 months, and she's turning 24, and I told her I was available 24/7. I've also been making a playlist that I will put on my iPod to give to her.\n\nI struggle with emotions, and music is the only way I can express my emotions properly.\n\nThe apology letter is coming along pretty well. It helps that I'm a writer.\n\nThe playlist is another story. I've been trying to recreate it in iTunes from a playlist I have on YouTube. There are a lot of songs.\n\nI'm doing all this because I told her I was working on my mental health but kept failing to prove it. I got the motorcycle. But that's not much? I mean, I could have spent the money on sex and drugs. Instead, I chose the high road and bought a motorcycle. I'm taking meds for my OCD. I've quit drinking and cutting. I'm still smoking.\n\nDuring our last phone call, my friend told me I was a fucking psycho who didn't know how to be a friend. I asked one of my therapists and the escort I see regularly and got 2 *extremely* different answers. They didn't conflict, but instead, they seemed to compliment each other. It was weird, like that George Lucas quote about poetry and rhyming.\n\nSee, our friendship had been falling apart for a while. I didn't know why. Maybe I did, but I was too scared to admit it or something. But now that she's gone from my life, I think I can finally see where, when, why, and how it all went wrong and how I can fix it.\n\nI think if she's willing to talk things over, I might be able to explain what went wrong and how I've changed. Sure, it'll only have been about 50 days, not enough for most people to change who they are, but I'm not most people. And neither is she.\n\nThe very last thing she said to me was she wished me well. Well, her wish came true. And I fulfilled my promise to deal with my bike and my money. If we had waited just 4 days, I think we could have fixed this friendship.\n\nI think the best-case scenario is I prove to her that fairytales are real. The worst-case scenario is I get arrested and charged. Maybe a restraining order. I think the most likely scenario is she ignores my gifts and apology letter.\n\nI want to be a good person, I want to help people, but I needed to help myself first. I just haven't been able to do that. At least not until now.\n\nEXTRA DETAILS.\n\nSurprisingly, there's a lot I left out. I'll fill it in here. I was a selfish, cruel, narcissistic, vile, despicable person to her, and I treated her like shit. And she was the first and only person that ever made me feel like  I was worth something. I fell in love with her, and I repaid her kindness and generosity with cruelty and lies and manipulation.\n\nIn my absolutely measly defence, she failed to tell me important details until it was too late, and her pattern recognition is so bad to the point where it seems like it doesn't exist. I'm autistic, and one of the things we're known for is fucking pattern recognition. And a complete inability to understand basic human emotions. I only know what emotions are because of pattern recognition.\n\nIt's been a long four days. I've been walking up and down hills for at least 12 hours since Friday, and I said some of the worst things I've ever said in my life to one of the kindest, most understanding people I've ever met, leading her to call me a fucking psycho that doesn't know how to be a friend.\n\nI'm going to log off of everything for a while. Hopefully, something longer than a few seconds. Something closer to 3 days would be better.\n\nThanks for reading.", "title": "I lost my closest friend because I was stressed out and angry and needed to blow off some steam.
