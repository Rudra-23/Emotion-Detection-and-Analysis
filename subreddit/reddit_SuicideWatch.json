Wanted to share something just to calm myself, otherwise I'd be no more. Been through ups and downs, but my lowest point started when my father and maternal half-brother died.\n\nFather died on 2011. Heart attack. (My parents separated years prior.) I learned about his death when my Uncle texted me. That day, I didn't cry. He's dead? So? I hated him. Still, we went on his wake three days later. It didn't go well. We were not allowed anywhere near his coffin. Why? I am an illegitimate child. The legal wife was there. The legitimate children were there. They disliked us. We were an outcast. We forced ourselves out the same day. I only cried myself out on the way home. For years, I have not seen him, not even on his death bed, not even on his last day. We never talked about it at home either.\n\nMy older half-brother, 19, died on 2012. He had a congenital heart disease. He lived well, so his death was unexpected. The elders said my father loved him like his own, so he probably took him with him. :) He was buried on my hs graduation day. Instead of celebrating, there we were mourning, tired.\n\nTwo strikes. But life goes on. I started uni that same year, took up Civil Engineering. Made friends, and had fun on the first two years. All is well. Or so I thought. On my third year, I started becoming anxious and stressed. Started failing grades, started skipping classes. I spent most of my time at home. Sleeping at lot. Yes, nearly a whole day. Until I decided to just drop and reassess myself. I stopped doing any thing, but journaling. I realized how much I miss Pa and how lonely I have become. I mourned late and it affected me severely. Since then, I started thinking of self-harm. I badly wanted to be with them. Attempted several times, but I couldn't just complete it. I know that I am not afraid of death. I was a few times near. But I thought maybe life would be better if I give it another chance.\n\nMy mother saw and read my journal. She talked to me about getting help. We came to an agreement. But getting help was a mistake for me. I only felt so much more vulnerable. I've become worse. To the point that I couldn't even leave the house unless someone accompanies me. I can't step out of my comfort zone, till now. I got back to harming my self. It's the only way I know to stop bothering every one.\n\nThe trigger has been pulled:\n\nRecently, I got on a huge argument with my mother (she is away) and siblings. She talked on how ungrateful I am; how dare I talk back to her; that I am disregarding her sacrifices... Hold up. You don't want to \"sacrifice?\" Wasn't it a parent's obligation in the first place? Then you shouldn't had gotten pregnant. Told her she should have thought of it before she engaged in adultery. Yes, I said those. I am angry and not backing down. Maybe wrong but I am and will never be sorry. Now she threatened of abandoning me. I have pride and all right.

It normally doesn't cause visual defects, but it can and in my case it does. No one can say whether I will go blind one day or if I get to keep the sight I still have left. With no prognosis, I have since age 12 (21 now) adopted a mindset where I (so that I don't have to fear the prospect of blindness, which to me seems worse than death) have gotten used to the idea of suicide if things go south with my eyes. \n\nAt age 12 I was in pieces, mentally, and I've never been able to, or even tried, to accept blindness as a possible outcome. The idea of death quickly latched onto me as a source of comfort. I realized I didn't have to deal with my illness if I didn't want to, and from then on it's been my only way of handling life. \n\nFor now I try to live as well as I can (not easy with OCD, GAD, alcohol issues and severe depression), but the thought of suicide is always at the back of my mind. I consume everything I can find on the subject of death. I read about and watch terrible things to fuel my obsession, I  write about it and I live in it every day. I have become desensitized to the thought of my own death to the point where it's just a regular daily ritual for me to think about it. It's ironic, but I honestly believe that the thought of death saved me from even more severe mental illness. Just the knowledge of having an exit, a back door sort of, gave me something to focus on and I didn't feel so helpless and lost anymore. I've come to realize that control is the thing I crave the most, and suicide would be the ultimate taking back control over my own destiny. \n\nThe sad part is that it has stolen away all my dreams. I have become an alcoholic, nihilistic hedonist living just for the moment, because there's no use making plans for the future. I look down upon myself and others. The world is an awful place. Nothing has any real meaning, I just want to cram in as much stuff as possible while I can, even if it hurts me. I feel so empty. Not even music makes me feel as great anymore. I just exist for the sake of curiosity and out of duty. As long as I'm not blind or close to it, I will keep on. But seriously, it feels so pointless.

All due to complex trauma (CPTSD).\n\nMy childhood wasn't awful, but my brother was abusive, made me feel impotent and scared, I would wet the bed regularly, etc. My parents constantly fighting, a dad that is constantly angry, depressed and anxious and on pills, mom would parentify us and tell\nus of her suspicions of his cheating, etc.\nI dissociated and daydreamed through that a lot, but It wasn't the worst. \n\nThe actual worst came in high school. Four years of isolation with not a single friend because I was queer in a  conservative poor part of latin america, which meant that for years I had to hide whom I liked, how I wanted to dress, act, etc. I became a ghost in a shell. I developed an internet addiction, making it worse as I saw teens in the US or wherever leading the sort of life I wish I had. I developed a porn addiction because I couldn't even tell others I was gay without fearing for my life, so porn was my only known way to relief.\n\nI went on to study something I didn't want to because you couldn't even formally study what I wanted to in my tiny country, and I would make no money with art, allegedly. So I just continued being a shell.\n\nAt 20+ I got grindr, moved to a big city and was finally living sort of how I wished, except that stored trauma and a broken amygdala don't just go away instantly. So I was still out of my body, which is a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone. I was finally able to have sex but so many years of my previous life made it uncomfortable. I was subconsciously  terrified of being touched. I hated my body even though it was fine. So many shitty things all because I went without a hug for years. I had to drug myself to be sexual with a human being. \n\nSo I put a stop to everything. I couldn't carry on like this. No point. So instead of the regular pills and talk therapy I quit school and decided to try whatever I wanted and felt night help. This actually worked, and slowly over the years I've been healing from dpdr. Finally, after a decade+ of pure hell, I'm out.\n\nOr not. Coincidentally, in these last years I started balding fast and, some months ago, chose to try finasteride to stop it. I quit it 6 months ago due to side effects, and now I STILL have no libido. And no hair. As a virgin.\n\nIt feels like a cruel joke. My stunted desire to be with someone else was a major reason for my sickness, and now that I'm recovered I don't want to be with anyone. Why couldn't I have been asexual all along? \n\nI fought over a decade with the mental health system and took dozens of pills and did tons of therapies many of which made things worse or retraumatized me, to finally find things that worked to get me out of the HELL that is dpdr, ONLY because I had hope that I would one day get out and be able to live all that I couldn't then. Well, nope. I won't be able to have sex. I can't even look at myself in the mirror because of my hair or lack thereof, either. I had to quit college due to my illness and now I have to start all over again...\n\nBut I have no motivation to continue living. I fought for too long. I have no interest in fighting these new battles now. The only energy I can see myself investing now is in slowly making peace with the fact that this consciousness is going dark soon.

I've been depressed from a very young age and been suffering from anxiety for as long as I can remember.I'm a hard working person and I've never asked for a handout from anyone and I don't care about \"having things\" that much.  \nI'm very very bad at relationships because no matter how good the person I'm with is, I can't seem but to bring them to a point where they can't stand me being myself. I can't commit to being there for anyone every day, I can't keep the energy to talk to people all the time as I need to be alone for the most part. The small group of friends I have are the only people I've managed to keep around for so long and it's not for anything that I can offer them that someone else can't, I think they're just used to me and that's why they have stuck around so long. I try my hardest to be a good person, not to bother anyone, not to hurt anyone, and not to be a burden to anyone; and I can easily recognize actions/behaviors that would bother or burden people and I avoid them at all costs.   \n\n\nLife is emotionally and mentally too much for me and I can't think of any other relief than ending my own life, but the only two things that have been keeping me from actually doing it is fear and guilt. I'm afraid of whatever comes after and I don't expect that to change because who the hell knows, but the guilt has become something too much for me to even think about. I don't want to hurt people around me by such an action, i know my family love me and they've done their best to give me the best life they could and they don't deserve to feel that way as a consequence of me ending my life. I love them really much and I wish they had the son they deserve who would make them proud and happy instead of a depressed lonely person like me.  \n\n\nI myself feel responsible for everyone's mental and emotional wellbeing and I just don't know what I can do anymore.

It took me 5 years to finally tell my therapist that I was suicidal and it went badly. He told me that one of his patients commuted suicide and now his mom was one of his patients. He shamed me and I couldn't bring myself to go back. \n\nNow I'm 23 and I'm having a ton of issues. I feel like I've cut off all my emotions and never feel like I'm living in the moment. I can't engage in conversation easily mostly because I just don't have the emotional capacity to do so. I remember what it's like to feel things and I know how I'm suppose to feel when talking to people but I feel numb. Lately I've been having issues with my memory to the point where I'll shower multiple times a day because I forgot I already showered. Also Ive I experienced my first panic attack and it was bad. I was hyperventilating so badly that I couldn't moved my fingers at all and my dad had to pick me up from work. I tried grounding myself with the 5 senses grounding exercise a friend taught me and it didn't help. I just couldn't bounce back.\n  2 weeks ago I decided I owed it to my family to get help. I reached out to a therapist who referred me to someone else who ended up referring me to several experts in somatic experiencing. I emailed all of them and have gotten no reply from any of them. I'm starting to think I may have dreamed writing those emails but am remembering it as a memory. The reason I think this is because I emailed through the therapist website and unfortunately that means it doesn't show up in my sent emails. I don't want to email them again on the off chance I've already reached out to them. I don't know what to do here. \n\nI was thinking I could talk to my psychiatrist and talk to him (been going to him for 10+ years) but I feel such an overwhelming need to present myself as fully functional that I've never talked to him about my problems and unfortunately I'm super neverous to even start that conversation. I feel strongly that I can't be vunrable with people already present in my life. \nI just don't know what to do? Ive been stuck like this for so any years that everyone thinks I'm actually this way as a person but I know for a fact I'm not, you know? The worst part is that I'm extremely open about my issues but because I present everything like it's no big deal it just gets brushed off. I'm not suppose to be like this. A good example is that I use to be very affectionate and touchy but I'm not either anymore. I don't even let my family touch me or even sit next to me. I realized recently that I do this because I don't feel safe.\nWhat do I need to do to feel safe again? Why isn't anyone listening to my begging for help? Why isn't anyone emailing me back? What can I do to help myself when no one is getting back to me?\n\nI'm at such a loss. I'm not really expecting anything to come of this post. Really just a public place I can be open with. I just want to feel like myself again. To feel safe and vunrable but what can I do.? I know it's bad but I've been thinking really hard about possibly ending it. Dying sounds like such a relief that I think about it often. I just know I can't do that to my family. We've lost several people to suicide and I can't do that to my mom. But I'm scared.

I\u2019m a 46yr old male who has struggled with depression my entire life... my teens, 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s were filled with attempt and attempt... none of these were attention grabbers, a vast majority of my attempts were and still unknown by anyone. I tried everything, and I do mean everything, so much so I kinda accepted that you can\u2019t go til it\u2019s your time. Anyone who knows me thinks I\u2019m the life and soul of the party, I\u2019m the guy you come to when you have problems or secrets or just need a distraction... but inside I\u2019ve been dying for years. My family have all passed away leaving me behind and it made me realise just how pointless everything is ... it\u2019s all worthless so instead of attempting more suicide attempts I just thought I\u2019d wait it out and let the bad genetics that toon my family take me to. I withdrew completely from society, not having any social interaction whatsover, as a result what little social interaction skills I had have deteriorated to zero. In April last year I caught covid, it hit me extremely hard and I\u2019m still suffering from its effects... but it\u2019s not the physical side that\u2019s the issue but the effect it\u2019s had in my mental Heath... the depression I fought a long time to get a grip of has hit me harder than any other time in my life, my emotions are so all over the place they are exhausting me... I am emotionally exploding over every little thing... I\u2019m angry or crying continually. To escape lockdown and force myself to interact I started playing an online mmo when all this covid stuff came to the forefront last feb/March, I kinda felt I fitted in with all the misfits and outcasts that make MMO\u2019s their home and I became/am a rather popular character who people flock to as they find me funny... but they don\u2019t know the pain and struggle I\u2019m fighting everything single day.. they come to me with their problems... I shoulder so fucking much all day every day but these people need me. Trouble is I\u2019m now at the point myself where my struggles are becoming futile, the suicidal thoughts are back stronger than ever, I don\u2019t have any reason to fight anymore (I\u2019m single, no children, no value to society) and I\u2019m now making plans... I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m writing this as I know nothing anyone says can change this thought process... I don\u2019t need people telling me things will get better as I\u2019m old enough to know they don\u2019t, life experience has taught me every single day is a struggle, just some less so than others. I don\u2019t need people to tell me I need to go talk to someone, I\u2019ve done that many many times, it doesn\u2019t help, it just makes me more determined in my ways... I don\u2019t like people.. big on a person basis but as a species as a whole... I want no part of it and have no desire to engage. I\u2019m not looking for neither encouragement nor distraction... both are just temporary... the depression is still there in the background gripping tightly to my every thought. I\u2019m not looking for advise on being medicated, I\u2019ve tried them all... from diazepam to citalopram all the way through to seroquel... nothing has helped, I\u2019m not responsive to meds or therapy... I was turned away from cbt and told we can\u2019t help as there is no Avenue in, there was no way passed the barriers I built, my psychiatrists think it\u2019s my intelligence that was the problem... they could not find a way in as I headed them off at every pass... and that therein is where my problems stemmed... wasted intelligence, I saw the world for what it is really rather young and worked out the pointlessness of it all and therefore stopped trying out of a perceived perspective of futility. I still think it\u2019s all pointless, all of it... every action, every thought, everything... and I\u2019m now back to where I was... planning my exit... meticulously. Get help with your depression you\u2019ll say... but I love my depression... it\u2019s comfortable and embracing, I\u2019ve always loved it... it\u2019s been my only constant. So yeah that\u2019s it... I guess I\u2019m writing this for no reason other than I\u2019ve never really got these words out... i still intend to end it, I\u2019m not in no rush... it won\u2019t happen tonight or tomorrow but it will happen and I\u2019m neither happy nor sad that it will...

My violation states that I had failed to tell him(my PO) I missed physical therapy on 3 separate occasions, all within the same month. This is also during Covid and during a time which I have been having transportation issues.\n\nThe condition stemmed from me having a TraumaticBrainInjury and mental health issues which I failed many times to get to my appointments so this is their way of making sure I maintain my appointments. Also I am not court ordered to do Physical therapy and its not mentioned anywhere on any of my court files. It is for my hip from a car crash and he never asked me how it was going. He randomly decides to call them after about 2 months of him knowing I was doing PT (I have been doing PT for 2 months and have been talking with them about quittting since I have transportation issues and alot of other stuff going on like babysitting, treatment, college, mental health.) Without an ROI may i inform you that he called them and they told him the days I missded.\n\nThe judge and prosecutor approved this violation and it was served to me about 5 months ago. I was not arrested. This is my 4th violation. My probation officer is asking for 30 days in jail plus another 10 days for each day I have missed a physical therapy appointment.\n\nA little fact - I am doing the best I have ever done in my 7 years of being on probation. This is the longest I have ever been sober or maintained a treatment plan. I signed up for school in November and I started full time college at the beginning of January which I have all A's except for one class is a B, I have been taking my meds, I have been in contact and done everything hes been asking me. He still wants to send me to jail for not telling him I missed physical therapy.\n\nI have a mental health lady that I work very close with who knows some people in the justice system. My mental health worker agreed that this didn't sound right so she reached out to one of her contacts. The person she reached out to(a court administrator) also agreed that this was not okay to violate me for this. This person called my probation officers supervisor and they had a good chat.\n\nHis supervisor agreed that I should not be getting violated for this and that he needs to be aware of my TBI(that's another story). His supervisor also set up a little system that would have him and my mental health to meet once a month and discuss my barriers, my mental health(which is very severe), and what could help me to succeed. At this point I thought things were okay and the violation would be dropped or something.\n\nIt has been 2 months since his supervisor was contacted and he was spoken to by his supervisor. The court administrator started the first group conversation between him and my mental health, all he had to say was negative things about me pretty much trying to persuade them I was a liar and mannipulator. This upset my mental health worker but she kept her cool and replied hoping to work on what this was set up for and he never replied back.\n\nThe second time my mental health tried to communicate with him through email via the conversation his supervisor had created for them to work together, this time he never replied at all.\n\nmy probation officer tried to call my treatment counselor once and the main officer once over a four month period but didnt get an answer so he told me it wouldnt look good for me if he couldnt get ahold of them and he basically made me get all the information on my UA's and days attended at my treatment and I had to have my treatment counselor call him( he said these exact words \"you wanna have something good to add into your violation right?\", so I did that and the treatment had all great things to say about me. He didnt mention any of this in the violation and he refuses to acknowledge it in court.\n\nAnother thing. My lawyers father has brain cancer and she wasn't able to look into my case much until a few weeks ago.(boy did she get a lecturing) .. but anyways she told me we couldn't use the fact that he violated HIPPA Laws against him. So she said I will ask the prosecutor if theres anyway we can get this dropped. She called me back not even 4 minutes later and was like hey I have good news \"The prosecutor agreed to drop the violation if you can just provide a copy of your grades and attendance\"\n\nI sent my grades and attendance in right away and everything was good to go. I had court last week and I was in a good mood thinking \"heck yes thank you jesus this is finally gonna be sorted out properly\" (I have been prosecuted and taken plea deals at least 15 times, I never had help or proper counseling. I went to 3 prisons for a year and a half and I sat in jail for about 3 years. I have been locked up more than free since I was 18 and I am 25 now.)\n\nWhen court started my lawyer said \"im sorry judge i thought we had this sorted out but I guess not\" she said nothing else and then my probation officer started down talking me again saying negative things about things from my past(another story on how I ended up with a condition that says I have to do 40 hours of work a week or 40 hours of community service if i dont have a job) but now im going to school so that condition is irrelevant and covered.\n\nI called my lawyer right after court like what the hell why didnt you say anything to me why is this happening then she said \"your probation officer wants you to go to prison\" and im just like what the heck and i start getting after about her poor work ethics and how come she hasnt looked into A B or C etc. my phone died thank god. So after that I called my mental health worker who directed me to call the court admin lady that spoke with his supervisor.\n\nThe lady from court admid said \" i'm gonna have a chat with your lawyer (my lawyer finally started looking into my case 2 weeks ago because her dad had brain cancer, which she shouldve let me know or took off work but that was her excuse and i dont know) but she talked to my lawyer and called me back and was like \"okay..I had a good chat with your lawyer we are on the same page now, I am going to call your probation officers supervisor again and see if we can't get this thrown out. If he still wont drop the violation if his supervisor pressures him than I and everyone else that has been working with you this past year are willing to come testify on your behalf)\n\nI haven't had the best life as a minor or as an adult but I am finally strong enough to break some of the bad habits i picked up over the years.(I cringe everytime looking back at how mentally weak I was to my addiction and everything else in the world even though I wanted to get better so bad i could never do it, It almost hurts to type this and think about what I put myself through but im finally doing good im finally able to succeed and i can feel it) I am starting to find myself and remembering how to enjoy life and how to talk to people again i dont have any friends right now but Im starting to figure it out. Im finally at the point where i feel grown up and I want to do good I want to have a life and help other people. So I have been doing everything right as i can and trying to get help with my head and memory problems and social skill problems. \n\nAll my UAS have been clean. I have made it to all my appointments. I have been sticking to myself helping at home and spending time with my family and I finally figured out who is bad for me to be around since I have very strong addictions. Like I can say I beat my adiction and I want to become an addictions counselor thats what im going to school for. I'm doing everything I can this is my turning point in life and I don't want him to take that away from me because I don't have any more chances and Ive already wasted so much of my life and oppurtunities im finally starting to feel happy again and i still have work to do but i know i can do it. Ive told him this and he doesnt wanna hear it he says im just lying. I have only been working with him for about 8 months if that makes a difference.\n\n I have complied with everything hes asked for and I let him know of anything I can think of when needs to be. He has only came to see me once this whole time and barely ever contacts me but he wants me to go to prison because i'm a bad communicator is the way my lawyer puts it. Honestly guys I can take a picture i am being violated for missing 3 days of physical therapy and not telling him about it. I have so much to do day to day keeping up with school and my 4 mental health workers and trying to make it to community service at the time I honestly didn't think he cared about my physical therapy since it has never been mentioned in court.\n\nI am meeting with my lawyer tomorrow to sign ROIs of everything I can think of so she can prove how good im doing. Also if he wont drop it we have already planned to subpoena all my workers along with the lady who spoke directly to his supervisor.\n\nI am having a hard week because of this all and I keep expecting the worst no matter what. Last time I went to jail it was really hard to get back to normal and get on track again which really scared me.

But I'm still targeted for some unknown reason. It's so discouraging I'm afraid to even show up to class. I hate my school to begin with, so this doesn't help either. I can't stand being there.

I have limited vocabulary, poor language processing and communicating is extremely difficult. Doesn't matter if it's written or spoken. Very loose understanding of the world/society and just all around ignorant. Like being in a perpetual state of childhood but trapped in an adults body. I'm 30 and female.\n\nI don't have any interests or passions because I'm stuck in a mental prison where everything is confusing. I've never been able to even follow plots of standard entertainment like movies, TV shows, books. Attempting to read a book (even something like Harry Potter) makes me cry because it is too complex and having something as simple as a children's book be lost on me feels so defeating. Functionally, I'm illiterate. Forget being able to be educated/informed about important things or read notices sent in the mail/comprehend an important email. It all comes through into my brain as babble. Never was even able to learn to play video games or regular games because everything moves too fast and I can't understand the concept. I lose track of the objective and am unable to use higher thinking processes like strategizing. Games are so hard, just a chore and stressful. Sports are a blur. How can you learn about or truly understand anything when language and processing is so impaired? \n\nI also don't have the mental capacities to take care of myself, like think of what to eat, how to get necessary ingredients, how to prepare it. Anything I've ever done I've had to do by rote memorization. Motor skills are awful and I cant get a handle on how to do simple tasks from start to finish. I make a mess without noticing and trying to find the executive functions needed to clean it up is exhausting. If I accidentally hurt myself I don't know the necessary steps to take to handle it. I freeze and have a meltdown in the instance of accidentally hurting myself. \n\nThis is a miserable existence. I don't even have distractions I find enjoyable to get me out of my head. No ability to enjoy things in life, no ability to take care of myself, I stay inside and stare out the window living in a mental prison. Sometimes I'll go for a walk but I feel like a defenseless child all by myself. I get lost easily. Even when I tried to get into something not requiring too much skill or thought like hiking, I can't read maps or follow the trails well which just frustrates and upsets me. I think all of the learning disabilities and limitations got put into my brain from birth. \n\nHave tried to get professional help but how do you get accurate diagnoses, proper support when you yourself cannot communicate accurately? I accidentally leave out important background info, focus too much on irrelevant info without knowing it's irrelevant...cannot fully comprehend the info given back to me by the professional. Can't understand written reports. Have been on certain medications for years simply because a professional told me to and I felt I didn't \"have time\" to schedule appointments to figure out how to get off once I was on (think SSRIs with discontinuation symptoms). I can only do as I'm told which is so sad and scary. \n\nI faked it for so long without realizing I was just mimicking other people. I've heard this called \"masking\". The only way I could make sense of my limited understanding of things and how childlike I was was by thinking \"oh, it's because I'm in my 20s and quirky, I'm growing up! I'm learning as I go!\" I thought everyone was like me. Then I turned 30 and looked around and realized this is permanent. I've crashed and burned and the veil has been lifted.\n\nI would not wish this existence on the most evil person on the earth. Count yourself lucky if you have even one activity that is enjoyable! Music you like and knowing how to access it so you can listen to it! If you can understand a person when they are talking to you without just pretending to follow along! If you have ever enjoyed a book and understood it! If you can express yourself accurately! So many gifts people have that they don't realize.\n\nAll the days are the same to me. Endless nothingness. Time doesn't even hold meaning. Don't have memory of the events of my life. My parents and brother also have communication difficulties and struggle to get by, so we are prevented from having true relationships with each other although we desire connection.\n\nHow could suicide not be justified here? It is the kindest, most compassionate, most loving thing I could do for myself. My body will only get more worn down as time passes, with a mind unable to take care of it.

To give a very short version: I got a job almost a year ago (UK, for reference). Immediately I had to shield for 3 months because covid.

I rotate between a number of Reddits; r/COCSA, r/adultsurvivors, r/AutismTranslated, r/buddhism, r/CPTSD, r/widowers and a bunch of related ones. Just on a hunch I searched and found this one. I am both a survivor of an attempt, and the widower of my wife, who succeeded. \n\nI think my attempt, which nearly worked and left me disabled, realigned my thinking about suicide. I'm autistic and alexitymic and a bunch of other alphabetic combinations. My wife struggled with her CPTSD, for our 32 years together. Her treatment over the last fifteen years was clearly innefective. One of our last conversations was that she had decided that suicide would not be an option, after four previous attempts. She told me she would not do it.\n\nIt's hard to say what came first, our emotional struggles, financial struggles or the struggles our children have faced. Hard, because obviously it was our emotional struggles. Which, in retrospect, it seems we should have found healing. But, you can't find what you're not looking for. My wife and I both came from a time and culture that discouraged exploring or treating our mental health. \n\nWhen my wife sought therapy, after her first attempt, she asked me \"what about you?\". So, for a time I also saw someone. Skipping over vast swaths of my trauma history. Encouraged by my therapist to \"stay in the present\". My wife's experience was similar \"what would help you feel better NOW?\". Instead of us both finding support to sort out our past, our trauma and THEN how we could begin to live in the present.\n\nA prominent trait of being autistic, as \"high functioning\" as I may be, is that when I am stressed out I revert to taking things quite literally. In the weeks before her suicide, my wife confronted her mother over the source of her \"depression\". After nearly two years of her mothers damning \"truth\", her criticism of our marriage and parenting, and holding up the home she had provided my wife growing up as an exemplar of parenting. My wife had been serially abused throughout her childhood and adolescence, with her primary abuse only stopping with her fathers death when she was 20. Her mother called her a liar.\n\nThere are twists and turns to hers, and my story. I thought that final confrontation with her mother was a turning point, and it was. Not for this life, but for the next. I can't be angry at my beloved, because I know how she suffered. I only wish I had found a way to intervene, a way to help her find peace and gratitude, here in this life with me and our adult children. Because although they are adults, they are devastated (two years and several months out), and so am I.\n\nSo... I don't exactly know where I'm going with this. Other than as hard as life has been, and is now, I would rather continue on. I've lived long enough to know that the depression that nearly consumed me as a teenager... passed, the abuse... ended. Had I succeeded I would have missed out on all of the happiness and joy that was to come in my late twenties, and lasted long enough that I would never want to have missed it. \n\nThere is sanctuary in hope.

Two years ago I was kicked out at 18, I fled to GA where my girlfriend was and her family let me stay in an old pool house. I worked my ass off and finally got to a good point after about a year. Got a car, rented my own place. For that whole time I was destroying my body, I was miserable so I ate. I gained 200lbs in a year and a half eating cheap Mexican food from the restaurant I was serving at. Since then I've been working a decent job but it's mindless and draining while also working the same serving job on the side. Still just making enough to survive. Somewhere around February I finally got in a good enough mental state to clean up my diet and start working out more after I nearly lost my toe due to an infected ingrown toenail, naturally due to obesity (and probably undiagnosed diabetes) I have lower circulation in my feet so an infection there could've been really bad. Almost immediately after I started working out more my girlfriend of three years broke up with me and started dating a guy she met weeks prior, someone I \"didn't have to worry about\". Following that I repeatedly kept getting called into work at the restaurant, taking time away from the gym, also where she works and talks to her new guy, repeatedly subjecting me to that. Not her fault of course, just absolutely hurt to see play out infront of me so fresh out of the relationship. In my other job my work load keeps increasing because I'm responsible, just so draining to do the same shit every day and not seeing much for it. Now a couple months later my ex is forcing her way back into my life, saying she broke up with me because she thought it was best for me so I could focus on self improvement. Of course, she's only coming back after finding out the guy she started seeing after me had a girlfriend the entire time! So she's begging me to forgive her. I told her everything her relationship did to me and how I could trust her again, and I had to watch her cry. This week my landlord is getting an appraisal and I feel I'm going to be kicked out. I can't afford other places in the area. I have no connections to anyone else, no good relationship with my parents since I was kicked out. No friends in the area. I feel like I'm on the cusp of losing everything again, if I get kicked out I am buying a gun and killing myself. If I don't have enough improvement by the time I'm 21 I am killing myself. I just feel so destroyed by these past few months, working two jobs on top of dieting and going to the gym just leaves me feeling broken. Emotionally I am broken from my relationship. I just want it to end. I just want to feel stability. I've lost 35lbs but I'm still massively fucking obese.

He said that anyone who thinks this world is great is in an ignorance is bliss situation, and they just don't understand how horrible people are. \n\nNow through all of this he has never put any blame on me or made it feel like any of this is my fault and reminds me that I'm one of the great things in his life.

I got him out of his bad situation but it's been **four years** with little progress and a lot of backslide. This is OK; it took him decades to get where he is and it's going to take time for him to get back from that place. With that said, he has recently received two very unlikely treatments that really have him back on his feet.\n\n \n\n1) Nothing would treat his depression. Every pill would work for a week or two, and then he'd be back where he started. Because of his PTSD, his doctor was considering electro-shock therapy. It got back enough that he went to see the shock doc, but they didn't light him up. Instead, they put him on a medication for seizures - apparently his severe mental state has actually changed the way his brain works, so he can't even sleep like a normal person. His brain doesn't heal/recharge overnight. If you were led to your state by a long line of abuse or trauma, then you might benefit from the seizure meds as well. Tell this story to your doctor. Keep in mind, though, that these meds would be worthless if they hadn't also done:\n\n \n\n2) A blood test. I never would have thought of this, and apparently none of his other doctors did until he got to the electroshock place. The verdict? His Vitamin D levels are exceptionally low. Vitamin D is a major factor in your energy levels. It turns out the reason he was tired all the time, all day, every day, no matter how much he slept, waking up tired, was not because of depression or PTSD - he was just at about half the bare minimum of a functional level of Vitamin D. The doctor gave him a huge dose and within a few days he was back on his feet. It wore off recently; apparently he has a hard time absorbing it naturally, but they got him on a steady dose and in a few more days, he was back.\n\n \n\nHe wasn't frustrated and hopeless because he was 'sad' - his brain had literally been beaten out of shape and, from its perception, hadn't slept in ten years. A pill is changing that.\n\n \n\nHe wasn't tired and unable to function because he was 'sad', he was biologically missing something his body needed. This was easily replaced, once it was detected.\n\n \n\nDepression is very real. I have it too. It makes you feel bad things much, much moreso than they are worth. Anxiety is real, I have that too; it amplifies stress and if you're not stressed it'll whip some up for you. PTSD is real - do I have it? Maybe a little, I don't know, but he was properly diagnosed. What does it do? If I understand it, it takes all your problems and sorts them to little categories, and whenever you have a stressor, it puts it in the category and then tries to make you re-live everything in the collection. Also, it makes you unable to sleep properly so your brain can heal. These things are all real and I am not dismissing them, and we will both struggle with them to some degree for as long as we live - but they were masking some basic, mechanical aspects his physiology that were out of whack. \n\n \n\nThe point is, I urge you all to ask your doctors about this stuff. Get a battery of blood tests done, ask if you might have some kind of trauma affecting your ability to sleep. Take a look at this very basic stuff before you do anything permanent. I intend to follow my own advice very soon.\n\n \n\nI almost lost my best friend. While I was looking at his abuse and family history and all these grand horrors, the truth was that I had moved him to a place that was a little too cloudy.

She was so smart, so funny, so beautiful! For me she realy war Perfect. I have imagined many times how we will grow old together and live a whole life of complete happiness.But, you all know, how its end. 4 years ago I ended up in the friend zone. We continued to be friends, to spend a lot of time together, because during these 4 years she did not have any real relationship with anyone. I was happy every day that I spent with her, and in those moments I was really happy.But at the beginning of this year, she started a relationship. And today she stopped 7+ years friendship with me because she does not have time for me because of her new boyfriend.And i am so lost. I have the feeling that I have lost a part of myself, I lost not just a friend, or gilr i love, in which I am in love, even if she did not love me, but a person with whom I had such a psychological closeness as I had with no one before. I think that I will never hear her voice, her laugh, never see her smile, never touch her hands. And I don\u2019t know how to deal with such a loss?

I think that everything that I would like to do with her in life she will do with another man, that she is happy, while I am not even a part of her life. And i really dont know how to live with that situation.  \nver the past 11 years, I have been rejected 8 times. I've never had a real relationship.  \nNow I am sure that I am one of the worst people in the world, that I am trash, because even the most dear person in the world \"threw me in the trash.\" I don't believe I can ever be happy.  \nI'm so deeply stuck in depression that I have no idea how to get out of it.", "title": "Im in very dark place right now"}, {"created_utc": 1623152197, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nv1z0y/fuck_them/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m so fucking angry.

It took every thing I had not to burst into tears while he went through the flight and detailed every single thing that I did wrong. I tried so hard for this test, everybody I talked to about it said \u201cyoull do great! you always do! you got this! itll be amazing!\u201d and I think thats another reason it hit me so hard , bc I was so fucking embarrassed. I don\u2019t fail things. The whole time he was talking I just couldn\u2019t stop the thoughts of how worthless and stupid I was.

For some reason theres a sharp blade in my car and a few weeks ago I discovered that its very effective in making myself bleed. Its kind of like a scalpel?

My last girlfriend joked about me wanting to drive cars and said \"just make sure you don't buy one with a blown headgadket haha\" and that's exactly what happened.\u00a0  \nIt's like God or some force is confining me to some narrow field of reality where I have no control and feel as though I'm being groomed to be an artist/musician. Every time I try to break away from the patterns and behaviors associated with that it's like the force returns multiplied. My latest forceful effort being performance car driving.  \nMaybe I'm having a midlife crisis.  \nI'm 32 and live with my parents and I didn't used to think it was a big deal and I've never been a freeloader or at odds or consistently mean to my parents, it's been relatively normal since childhood. Yet my last girlfriend and all of the internet friends I had were so nasty and spiteful to me about being my age and living with my parents still whenever they got angry or had a bad day- then they'd go back to trying to be sweet or talk regularly.

I felt like I was getting too old to pursue that dream.  \nI got out of the mental hospital and just started working hard and went off meds. This is the longest I've ever held a job and I make 11$hr.  \nI figured after all of the car deals went bad that I should just play guitar and see where it takes me and then a guy I consider a friend at the store said \"oh, so you're gonna be a rock and roll loser\" when I said I might just give up on wanting to be a driver.\u00a0  \nLike what am I supposed to do?  \nThe way this is typed is terrible because I'm on a phone and everything is fresh from today and yesteryear so I'm just typing sorry if it's terrible  \nI feel like killing myself and I didn't really allow myself to realize it until about 10-20 minutes ago.  \nIt's like whatever I do there's some pre-written narrative I can't control and the people I call friends are so mean to me and it's not an exaggeration at all and then when I do the same to others to try to push back then I'm the mean person.

Or at least just go away and live on my own. Nobody has to care about my shit. Everyone already has enough problems to deal with mine.\n\nAnd this brings me to the reason I'm writing this post. I spoke to my \"girlfriend\" and I asked her, what would happen if I disappeared and never came back?\n\nShe said it would be normal. Everyone was going to disappear.\n\nMaybe I worded it wrong? Maybe it came out of nowhere and she decided to take the most logical answer... But if I'm honest, I felt a punch in the gut with that. I felt she doesn't care.\n\nI didn't want to come here. But honestly I got tired of making people uncomfortable with my jokes about suicide or depression. My best friend from high school outright told me one time; \"you make people sad\"\n\nAnd I do, I make people sad, and that's the main thing I wanted to avoid. I want to make people happy, if I can't laugh along with everyone, I might as well make people laugh at me, right?\n\nI just need for someone to make me feel like I exist. I want to recognize my own existance, like I have the right to exist. I don't even ask for happiness anymore... I just wanna feel like I'm not some sort of ghost.\n\nI just wanna exist.", "title": "I feel trapped."}, {"created_utc": 1629465929, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p8558p/my_suicide_note/", "num_comments": 26, "score": 3, "selftext": "I don\u2019t care who reads this since I\u2019ll probably be dead but I just wanted this out there I guess.

I've attempted suicide a few times and I never liked to make suicide notes but, here we are.   I hate bothering my friends with that shit, but I need to get this out, so, I'm posting it here. \n\nLockdown ruined my life and my mental state.  If you see previous posts/comments I've made that will explain why.  I don't want to go too much into it because its too painful for me. I just hope the next generation sees this and never repeats something like that ever again. \n\nI have an undiagnosed mental illness.  The doctor says its CPTSD, I don't think its that but whatever it is its got worse.  I can't stop hallucinating.  I can't stop being paranoid.  Every person who so much as taps my window by mistake is a person from the government spying on me in my eyes.  My panic attacks have become so bad they've almost knocked me to the ground.  I have not known true happiness since I was around 18.  I don't experience any form of happiness asides mania and that's the fucking worst part of it because my manic episodes have ruined my life.  I don't know whats real and what isn't real anymore.  I still think my abusive ex can read my thoughts.  I keep thinking she's seeing me write this right fucking now.  at least I'll be free from her.  \n\nThe mental health services here are a joke.  I've tried so hard. So. Fucking. Hard. I've tried my damn best to get some kind of help. Anything. I'm clearly mentally fucked, I always have been, 2020 exarcerbated it.  They have done nothing. They spoke down on me like I was a teenager going through a phase, even though I'm almost 23 fucking years old.  I don't think they even bothered their arses to check my age.  It took my mother to yank the phone off me and tell them how I can't stop self harming and doing self destructive shit, and beg them to do something.  They still haven't.  I begged to be checked into a psych ward and they flat out said no.  All of my appointments have been through fucking ZOOM for christs sake.  My legs look a mess from self harm and they wont even let me have the dignity of getting a real appointment. \n\nI have no money. None. I will die in poverty. I've already told my best friend to take my cat, she loves him.  She deserves a far better pet owner than me.  I've not told him I'm dying. \n\nI have tried so hard to get a job. So so fucking hard.  Universal credit and council tax keep fucking me over at every turn.  I'll likely die on this shit, but its better to go out now than inevitably starve to death. \n\nAnyway, I want to say goodbye without worrying my friends and family to death.  They will probably find this and find out why I've died.  \n\nAnyway.  For gods sake.  I seriously hope the younger generation see this and fucking DO something about how absolutely fucked up this planet is.  I'll be watching down on them. \n\nI'm going to call an ambulance so at least I'll die in hospital instead of some poor fucker finding my body.  The last thing I want to do is fuck up anyone else's life. \n\nGoodbye.  Please take care in this fucked up world.  Look after yourselves and your pets.

I've been researching methods for a long time too, and since I am unable to get a firearm where I live, I have decided to use a very sharp knife instead. I have an insulin pump, so I may also put myself into an insulin shock to make sure I die. Not one method is certain to work, so it's better to use multiple, right? \n\nToday something happened. I do not wish to share any explicit details, but it is another major failure, like those in my past that have put me onto this path in the first place. It is irreversible, and after so many years of working to repair my past trauma, I am unwilling to go through all that (work which is also still very much unfinished) again with this.

I have parents that love me. I have a brother. I even have lots of friends, although none are particularly close to me anymore. Do I have a girlfriend? No, and I've never had one. That is one of my many failures. But I understand no one could have a healthy relationship with me, in my mental state.\n\nSo what will I do today? I will spend the day doing simple things I enjoy. Watching my favorite shows, playing some video games, eating good food. I will write a short message on my notebook for my family and friends.

That's where I will do it. I'd be lying if I said I'm not afraid of the pain, but I've felt all kinds of physical pain in my life, so I should be able to handle it. I know how to cut my wrists so that I will bleed out. It will be a while before anyone will find me, so that should increase my chances. I will probably listen to some music while I go. During my life, I've slowly been building a playlist of songs that have some special meaning to me.

So I was left to find a better paying job to be able to afford to live on my own. I found a better paying job and things started to go well until they let go a bunch of people because it was slow. I was one unfortunately that got let go. I have tried to apply for unemployment to help out but they never approved it. So the past few weeks I have been looking and looking and nothing it\u2019s hitting back. I am about to lose my car, home, my phone is about to be shut off. Hell I can\u2019t even afford to get food barely. I am literally at my last straw all I have ever done was what I was told to do and I get fucked over and treated like shit by the world and I am just done with it. \nIt\u2019s just a deep void And as soon as I see a little light I just end up falling deeper and I\u2019m tired of it I\u2019m just going to let the void take me because I just can\u2019t honestly afford to live anymore.\n\nMy family is not the most financially stable so I can\u2019t even ask them for help. My credit went down when I had co-signed on a car for my dad then he ended up filing for bankruptcy and left me to find a car on my own.

Also forgive me for the format, I did it because I am\n\nmentally ill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what's wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere do I even start  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI noticed severe depression at some point in elementary school. I believe I was about 8 or 9. My first suicidal thoughts followed soon after. I knew nothing\n\nat the time, but this depression was the start of my mental health crisis. Middle School was the first time when I had considered \"Okay. There actually may\n\nbe something wrong with me.\" Early Middle school is when my drastic mood swings began. Imagine you were chained to a swing set that constantly swung back and\n\nforth, sometimes swinging faster, and sometimes being stuck on one end or the other. Could be for days, could be for years, I never know what to expect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one end of the swing you have total darkness. Completely consumed by your thoughts every hour of the day. I would include that there\n\nare suicidal thoughts, but now that I think about it, that is the only type of thought I have during this period. When in this state I withdrawal from \n\neveryone. I used to try and ask people to help or talk to me, but I have never met someone who understood or could say something to help me. When in this \n\nstage I am utterly hopeless and won't allow anyone to help me. One thing I have noticed is that when I am in the darkness, I typically never hear from my \n\nfriends or loved ones. It is a combination of people not helping me because they feel I have pushed them away as well as people keeping distance from me.\n\nWhen in this state I will frequently lash out at those trying to help me, any combination of the wrong words will make me feel hatred for you. A lack of\n\nmotivation and effort leaves me sitting idly wondering \"Why should I not just fucking do it to myself right now?\". And I have tried. Twice while I have been\n\non this specific side of the swing. My longest depression lasted well over a year. And by depression I do not mean crying to yourself at night, I mean a \n\nconstant debilitating weight on your shoulders every step you take. My confidence turns into nothing and every conversation I have is extremely awkward.\n\nEvery interaction leaves me thinking that the other person secretly hates me, and I take action to avoid as many people as I can. I once went 10 days \n\nwithout saying a word. I wouldn't even speak to myself. However I am still unsure if I was in the darkness or no mans land when that happened. Whenever \n\nI reach out for help while in this phase, the advice people give me just makes me mad. I got so tired of the same trained bullshit response that to this day\n\nI can't stand therapy. Nobody can help me when I'm in the darkness except for myself. And it's very frustrating because no one understands that there is \n\nnothing they can do to help. When I talk to therapists I hide my real thoughts because they will think I am crazy. I have felt like this ever since they \n\nsent me to the hospital for speaking my mind and trusting someone. My stay at the hospital became a huge source of trauma for me. Shortly after this point I \n\nrealized that the mental health system is a total joke and none of these psychiatrists have any clue what the fuck they are doing. If someone \n\nis gonna help me, it has to be me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other side of the swing I feel enlightened. This is not enlightened in the traditional sense, but more just the overtone of how I feel in this phase.\n\nI will believe that I am a genius, gain all of my confidence and obsess over things. I have energy, I command peoples attention and I feel like a comedian. \n\nWhen I am in this stage I do not give a fuck what anyone says to me. This causes me to act impulsively. I get aggressive faster and there is always a small \n\nchance that I burst into a full blown rage over something small. Instead of getting sad at night when I am alone, I get angry. My thoughts will race for \n\nhours as I punch the wall in agony of my traumatic memories. I do not sleep much at all when I get into this zone. The memories hit me as flashbacks and\n\ndaydreams and when I snap out of them I have to force myself to relax. The worst trauma dreams I have consist of me beating people I hate to death, however\n\nI would typically (not always) snap out of it before I killed someone in my mind. I know I would never actually kill someone but this is what happens in my \n\nthoughts on occasion and I can't help it. This often leads to me getting fucked up. It has been a self medication for me for a while because when I am \n\nintoxicated I can usually avoid the most painful thoughts. However sometimes to no avail, and I end up fucked up in terms of my sobriety and in terms of my \n\nhead. The best way that I cope with this side of the swing is by surrounding myself with people all of the time. There are certain people who's energy I feed \n\noff of. Recently, since I learned how to cope with this part of my mood swings, I have genuinely loved my life while I am in the enlightened phase. Although \n\nI still have the dark outlook on life, I reach an understanding where I feel like since I'm stuck here anyway I might as well be a fucking Rockstar. I gain \n\ncharisma and am able to befriend people so quickly. This head space is ideally where I would love to be all the time, a loud, outgoing and confident person. \n\nI would deal with the stress, rage and flashbacks happily. But unfortunately I have no choice. I think I am in the darkness more frequently than I am \n\nenlightened. Occasionally I will meet someone when I am in the darkness or in no mans land and go on without seeing them again until I am enlightened. There \n\nhave been several instances of people meeting me again and saying that I was like a completely different person or that I was way cooler when they met me the \n\nsecond time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow those are both sides of the swing set, but the scariest part lies in between. I call it no mans land. A deep and profound emptiness. It is very different \n\nfrom being sad and feeling like our pointless lives are grains of sand in the universe. It is a feeling that makes me say \"Are we even real?\". My third \n\nsuicide attempt came while in this stage. I did not kill myself because I was sad and had nothing to live for like when I am in the darkness. I attempted \n\nsuicide because I felt like I was a pioneer for the after life. It was driven by curiosity and reassured by knowing that I have absolutely nothing to lose.\n\nWhen I am in no mans land there are times where I do something and realize after that my conscious had no control over my actions. I had acted completely out\n\nimpulse. Sometimes I would say awful, horrible things to people. Whenever I drive with the window down I feel an immense pressure not to throw my phone out \n\nthe window. In no mans land I do not worry about the consequences, and it can be a dangerous thing. I will have the occasional vision. This is different from\n\nmy daydreams and flashbacks. my sight fades out and I start seeing a different situation in my head. My visions are almost never pleasant, and it is extremely\n\nhard to explain to other people. I do not hear 'voices' in my head. Everyone has a voice when they are just thinking to themselves, and when I \n\nam in no mans land I can't control the voice at all. This is another extremely difficult concept to explain to people. My mind's voice, as if I was passively\n\nthinking to myself, just goes nuts in my brain. And at the same time I know at a deeper level of thought that it is not what I am thinking about or doing \n\nwith my hands right in front of me. My thoughts, feelings and actions are all completely separate. I feel like I'm trapped in a prison in\n\nmy brain. In no mans land I have major issues communicating with people who I am not comfortable with, but for the people who I am comfortable with I can \n\nmanage. The most defining feature of no mans land is the constant overtone of paranoia. You question the intentions of those who love you most. This has \n\nresulted in me ruining several close relationships. Constant indecisiveness and the feeling of my mind blanking make it so hard to meet new people. Even \n\ndespite the strange unhuman feeling of this phase, I can usually act like a regular person and function normally enough to blend into the crowd. Life \n\ngets extremely repetitive and feels like it is not real anymore. No one ever understands what I mean when I say life is not real. Considering all of the \n\ndetailed daydreams/flashbacks/visions/dreams who is to say that I am not just part of a flashback or dream. Sometimes in no mans land I convince myself that\n\nI am retarded. Something of an autistic person or some other freak that people treat regularly - or even sometimes are kind to - because they feel bad for \n\nthe retard. This specific line of thought typically doesn't last me long, at this point in life I understand that I am not a retard. Fucked up in the head?\n\nYes probably. But definitely not retarded. However this just goes along with the paranoia and uncertainty associated with being in no mans land. Nothing is \n\noff the table and everything is questioned. When I look back to time periods where I was deep in no mans land, I would consider myself completely unstable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's the start of an answer to a very loaded question. What's wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a step into the darkness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI been fighting battles inside my own head for what feels like an eternity. And I see no end in sight. A lot of times I question why we as people are not \n\ngiven the right to take our own lives. I question a lot of things and I never get answers. I wonder what death is like, but who's to say I'll ever find out.\n\nI hope that it is eternal nothingness. The non-existence of my soul for good. I would like to feel inner peace, free from tormenting thoughts and backbreaking\n\nstress. When I look into the mirror I hate who I see. Everything that I hate, I am. When I look into my eyes I can see the pain. I just wonder why no one else\n\ncan. Why does no one ever check in on me? Everyone I'm close to knows im fucked up in the head already. Is it that they don't care? They don't believe there \n\nis anything they can do? People only love you when you can do something for them. Why does no one love me? But if I actually took my life it would be all \n\nkinds of fake love on social media posts from people who could never care enough when I was alive. This world makes me feel sick. Social media especially \n\nmakes me sick. There are so many young people who poisoned their mind with social media. And as much as I hate it I am still on social media because if you are\n\nnot, you are basically seen as a loser. I can't feel good anymore. Everything hurts. Even getting up to get food is draining. I have barely been eating at all.\n\nI feel suicidal. I have been locked to my bed. When I look to the future, I simply don't see how I can finish this semester. One day at a time. One day at a \n\ntime. One day at a time. There needs to be relief. Every waking moment is misery right now. Long, long nights and hard days. I am so behind on school work\n\nand I can't get myself to do it. I am carrying so much stress right now, I am living for my Maine trip in August. What is it about me that repels everyone away \n\nfrom me. I just think about people I know who can make meaningful relationships and maintain them too. What the fuck is wrong with me? I wish I could rewind \n\nand fix myself before I got to this point. I don't know how to use a support system. Even if there are people who want to help me, I am incapable of reaching\n\nout and exposing myself to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am fully surrounded by darkness all the time. I constantly think about killing myself. Every time the conversation goes silent, or if I think to myself for a\n\nlittle bit it starts to consume me. I am hearing these thoughts so much that they are changing from passing thoughts to genuine considerations. I know that I \n\nam bound to continue to have these feelings and moods for the rest of my life, so why not fucking kill myself right now? I am getting to a point where I don't\n\nsee the light anymore. I can't look forward into the future and be excited for anything. When I think about my life I feel like I would rather just kill \n\nmyself. everything I do feels pointless. I feel like I am bad at everything. I want to kill myself. It is sickening that the only thing stopping me from\n\nkilling myself is the shame and disappointment and sadness from people who are still alive. At the same time I feel like I shouldn't give a shit because I'll\n\nbe dead and won't have to worry about it at all. I feel like I am completely different from everyone around me. I feel like I am insane. What the fuck is \n\nwrong with me? I am starting to hate being around people entirely. Anything more than an hour makes me want to be alone now. I just feel like shit all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after I wrote all of this above, I went to see the school therapist. It was coaches suggestion that I see someone since my grades were so bad. Jordan \n\nwas a unique therapist, was very good at getting me to open up. Good enough to get me to let him read everything above. The result of this, in classic therapist\n\nfashion, was to dismiss me from school as a liability to myself or others and make me someone else problem. McDaniel was never the right place for me anyway \n\nthough, and quite honestly I am happy that he did that for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent my whole life in school and training for basketball and then my first year of college I crash and burn and ruin everything I have done with my life. It \n\nmakes me want to just kill myself. I don't know why I worked so hard for such a meaningless thing. I should have finished the job years ago. It would be fitting\n\nI couldn't even properly kill myself. Everything is downhill from here. I think I am getting delusional. My head hurts all the time now too, I never really had\n\nmany headaches before. I feel like I am doing nothing all the time. I have been researching effective ways to commit suicide. I have also been considering \n\ngathering materials and choosing a way to go. It just feels like I am here doing nothing, I'll be more useful wherever I go when I die. I have no desire to live\n\nanymore. I wanna run my car off the road and kill myself. Make it look like an accident or something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday I took a small amount of mushrooms and felt something I have been dying to feel for so long. I had a perfectly clear mind. I was sitting in my room \n\nand in the passenger and my thoughts were undisturbed. I felt in control. It wasn't until I had acknowledged my thoughts and how clear they were that I even \n\nhad a suicidal thought. It showed me just how much my thoughts were racing everyday. I was thinking a lot about \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ too. I really haven't had these kinds of\n\nfeelings for a girl in a while. I am just afraid that I am not in a good enough spot mentally to have a good relationship with her. I was thinking about texting\n\nher right there and telling her I had feelings. I don't want to fuck up another relationship, that shit really kills me inside. It is just so hard for me to\n\nmaintain relationships. To the point where I am scared to try and make new ones. It feels like there are multiple people living inside of me, waiting for their\n\nturn to come out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mindset towards medication is very undecided. I completely understand that I am sick in the head, realistically I need medicine to prevent me from doing\n\nsomething reprehensible. My worst fear is that the medicine changes me. And when I come to think about it, I don't know why I am scared of that. You would\n\nthink that I would want to be far away from my current self. But at the same time when I'm up during the day and sober, there are a lot of times where I \n\nwish I was on medicine. Just to feel different in any way. While I am finally coming to accept everything that is fucked up with my mind, I still don't \n\nunderstand it at all. And it is a horrible feeling to not understand why I feel like this or why it happened to me. let alone what the fuck I can do to fix it.\n\nI am in a very dark place, but to me it is a very good sign that I feel better than I did yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm back again. I should have put dates next to each passage, but fuck it. I have to be in a special mental headspace to even open this document up, and \n\nevery time I revisit this I get the same weird feeling. The reason I'm back is because once again, I feel utterly hopeless and I don't want to be alive anymore.\n\nSince I got this job offer and have had to be sober for a few days, my thoughts have really gotten to racing. I hate being sober. The job is very good. Great \n\nsalary, benefits. But these sober thoughts make me question the value of it. Who cares about the money when you go to sleep hoping you don't wake up every \n\nmorning? I simply do not see the point anymore. There's no more light at the end of the tunnel. Sometimes I feel like I am being ungrateful. You get a job offer\n\nfor a great job and want to die instead?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been sitting here for almost 15 minutes now and cannot create the words my brain wants me to say. I just want to die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's only been a few days since my last passage. It is currently 3 in the morning. The insomnia is fucking killing me. My thoughts have been racing for hours.\n\nI can't tell if I am having another mental spiral or if its just from being too sober. Time will tell. I am a human ticking time bomb. My irritability has \n\nbeen through the roof, which is a lot of times a sign I am about to go manic. I have been carrying far too much stress recently. I just can't stop thinking\n\nabout everything. Overthinking everything and really freaking myself out more than anything. It has been small things that have been happening, they occupy \n\nmy mind all fucking day, I can't fucking shake these thoughts, I want to curb stomp myself. Breathing exercises, meditation and things like that\n\nare completely ineffective for me. If anything it has a counter effect and makes my mind race even more. My mind has been going 100 mph for like 18 hours now\n\nand is not slowing down. The drug test is stressing me out. It is the only thing holding me back right now, if it wasn't for that then I would already be in\n\ntraining. The worst part is that I have no idea if these supplements and drink will even help me pass the test at all. For all I know I am just going to burn\n\na whole through the cup and waste another fucking month of my life doing nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't see the end game in life. It only gets worse from here. It's only gotten worse since high school. Why would I subject myself to years and years more\n\nof suffering. The way I see it, kill myself now and save the misery. Unfortunately everyone in our society would think I am insane for that. Why can't I\n\nhave the choice to live or die at the end of the day? Giving people the right to die would benefit humanity enormously in the long run. Less suicidal and\n\nmentally ill genes passed down would likely result in a better quality of life for people who actually want to live. Even despite this thought process, I am\n\nnot going to kill myself. Yet. Why? I don't even fucking know. Maybe I'll change my mind next week. Sometimes I feel like it is only a matter of time. I hate\n\nthat people judge those who kill themselves so harshly. Saying they were selfish. Maybe they are the selfish ones for forcing someone to live through misery\n\nwith them. Or maybe I'm just sick in the head. Suicide should be legal, people should be educated about it, and there should be some kind of way to get \n\nassistance for suicide. Should humans have the right to die?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to write about substances, since they have become a pretty big part of my life so far. I wonder how I would be if I was never introduced to any drugs.\n\nHell I probably would of already killed myself. I feel like I need a balance of substances in my life because I am incapable of creating those good feelings \n\nnaturally. And at the end of the day if your life is void of good feelings, your probably better off dead. Now that being said, that does not mean that I live\n\njust to use drugs. Drugs help me pull myself up from my lowest points and provide temporary relief to a permanent sickness. To say I live for drugs would be \n\na lie, but they certainly help me live. I do not consider anti depressants drugs, since I am almost positive that the majority of the anti depressants I \n\nhave been on were placebos. At this point in my life it feels like I need the help of certain drugs just to manage my stress and generally pull enough\n\nenjoyment out of life to justify continuing. Currently, the best use of any drugs I have gotten is from taking a barely noticeable amount of mushrooms (Micro dose)\n\nIt eases my mind, helps me relax, and doesn't really have any side effects and is only very slightly intoxicating. The issue is that I do not know the \n\nsustainability of this method. I am not worried about it making me have psychotic break, I am already insane. What I worry about with the micro dosing is the\n\npotential to build a tolerance to this drug, deeming it useless for me and losing one of my best tools for fighting off the ensuing darkness of my mental \n\nillness. I really do not enjoy drinking that much anymore, I just get so mad when I am drunk. I am liable to explode over nothing. I was never an angry\n\ndrunk before, not sure what happened to me. It's funny, a few months ago I wondered if trying to go sober would of helped my mental state. Jesus Christ,\n\nit made it 10 times worse. And I haven't even been completely sober. I think part of the insomnia, not all since I have had these issues for so long, is due\n\nto my abrupt quitting of weed. It's a little harder to go to sleep when you can't simply smoke yourself retarded. I am extremely indecisive on my feelings \n\ntoward weed. I go through periods where I don't smoke any, have no desire to except for the occasional bowl to help me sleep. Then there are periods where\n\nI can't fucking stop myself and I just smoke every time I wake up. Smoking right after waking up is one of the worst things I can do to myself. Unless it's\n\nlike a Sunday or something and I don't got shit to do. At the same time, I feel as though weed is one of my best medicine because it doesn't get me hung over,\n\nis relatively healthy compared to every other drug, and I can just smoke it at night and keep a good balance, it is also very good for calming me down and making\n\nmy brain shut the fuck up. Unfortunately I got to pass this damn piss test.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am getting furious at people who I love. Sometimes I feel like I can't control myself. Sometimes my actions and thoughts will be doing 2 completely different\n\nthings. Sometimes I don't want to get mad but I can't help it. It is hard to explain. In my brain I'll be thinking about how it is no big deal, I am actively\n\noverreacting, yet still my actions and words to others are explosive. The feeling of walking away from something after completely losing control of myself\n\nis one of the worst feelings ever. It makes me want to kill myself. I have been laying awake at night with my traumatic memories and waking up in cold sweats\n\nto stressful fever dreams. I have been getting about 2 hours of sleep per night over the past week. I have been feeling like I have to cry, but nothing comes\n\nout. Some of the feelings I have been getting are inexplicably horrific. I don't even know how to explain it. I feel like I have had a headache for like a\n\nmonth now. Every time I eat food my stomach gets queasy for hours. I feel uncomfortable almost all times of the day. I can't even get comfortable in my own \n\nbed. A lot of times at night when I can't sleep it feels like someone is watching me, or right behind the wall or something. I know that there is probably \n\nnot anyone there, but the paranoia has been pretty rough. The other night I couldn't sleep because it felt like there was bugs crawling all over my legs.\n\nI proceeded to check my legs just about every 5 minutes and there was nothing. I feel like I am building up to spiral out.", "title": "This is something I wrote over the course of like 6 months, any feedback is appreciated"}, {"created_utc": 1632621283, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvkeao/i_give_up_goodbye/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "My mom keeps telling me to kill myself, she said it 3 times in the last ten minutes, so im gonna do it, I don't care if she doesn't mean it I don't care how she feels, I can't do this anymore, bye mom, fuck you and dad.", "title": "I give up, goodbye"}, {"created_utc": 1632621150, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvkd1i/tomorrow_i_might_do_it/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "why why why why why why why.why do i have to be like this .

I'm in a different country (Netherlands) and still learning the language so I'm kinda restricted in the jobs I can work.\n\nSo i saved up money for university and my e-bike got stolen. It was a rental bike. Paid a lot of money in fines, my uni plams went out the window. B8t this time i had pretty severe chronic pain.\n\nI tried to work around it but it didn't go away.

I relapsed on benzos and completely shut down, laid in bed all day, was too stressed amd terrified to go to the fucking toilet.

Wish I had the courage to kill myself, or just succumb when death approaches. Very depressed. \n\nI'm a young male with the comforts of life, passable looks/fitness, decent social skills, intelligence (formerly, degraded of late). I should be travelling, working, fully educated, taking risks, with a girlfriend or family already. I'm none of these, and feel trapped in hell. Only one woman other than my mother ever said she loved me, and she's gone away.\n\n**Abusive family situation**\n\nDad verbally abuses, gaslights, attacks and harshly punishes anything that isn't his way. 17-y-o me didn't want to go to a summer camp? Solution: threaten to call the police on me and put me in a young offender's institute for the summer. My brother got a girlfriend? Kick him out of the house. Disagreements with friends at church? Scream at them until green in the face, then shun them. I was failing university, very depressed? Solution: \"I can't stand to see you suffering, get out and live somewhere else.\" (or 2020 edition: \"Get out of My house right now! There is no contract!\") I threw out an old floor cloth out? \"Get out of My house; Little Devil! Do not challenge me, you will lose. You do that again, I will break your face!\"\n\n**Failed university**\n\nThey had \"open book exams\", as part of their \"no detriment policy\" in 2020, as a half-arsed way to make up for dropping all classes and offering no support because of cOrOnAViRuS. I was in a bad place when it was running normally. Deadlines were as merciless as usual, I could get no help from them nor from Mum or anyone to get extensions (requires writing complex, evidenced essay about why you need more time for the complex evidenced essay you were supposed to hand in), and government loan people started trying to dodge out of paying for the course (which would have ruined me). I had to chase all that, so of course, fell behind again and failed. (There is no curse in the tongues of men or demons foul enough for the Univershity of Bath)\n\nNo degree, no luck finding work, no hope, no help finding any. No hope of finishing degree here in UK. \n\n**Lost contact with friends**\n\nI was raised homeschooled in an isolated lifestyle in Europe; went months at a time without seeing a single person outside immediate family. Childhood friends lived in different countries or elsewhere unreachable. Highschool in UK was good; I made up for lost time and was very popular, with lots of superficial friendships (and I liked it that way). Lost touch with most of them, save the best ones. After one of my dad's recent threats, I was spending a lot of time away with a nice lady and tutoring her little daughter; we fell in love with each other, and for a few short months, though not cured of depression, I felt happier, I lived a better life, with people to care for. But she's gone back to her home country, and I'm alone here. If I was worth anything, I'd be following her back there, finishing my degree at a local university there, working alongside helping raise the Little One. But I'm a mental mess, scarcely more than a child myself, and have always played it too safe to take the risk of jetting out to a new country and possibly failing a second degree.\n\n**No future hope**\n\nI'm a (possibly former) Seventh-Day Adventist. TL;DR it's a gloom-and-doom apocalyptic semi-Jewish Protestant not-cult, that has been expecting Dies Irae, 666, and Jesus [since 1844](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Disappointment). Maybe you heard of [Waco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege)? It was always ma\u00f1ana where we could look forward to being tortured and killed just prior to Jesus reappearing (unless a new US president or Pope is elected, in which case This One is The One who will bring about the Apocalypse/Antichrist). I've become increasingly cynical about it all; the prophecies read like numerology, the Second Advent is nothing to look forward to (since it involves being tortured and killed prior, and inhuman transfiguration after), the SDA church alternates between nuttier than the nut muesli I had for breakfast or a happy-clappy rock concert betraying its own beliefs. \n\nAnnoyingly, current events don't lend themselves to much hope, and look on the surface like a fulfillment of the prophecies of Revelation/QAnon/Adventist thought. It looks like the conspiracy nuts like my dad were right, with no end to authoritarian government restrictions in sight, despite beating the coronavirus with multiple vaccines and cures. It's just gonna keep being \"show your social credit papers to get in to this place, work here or buy food at this shop\", \"get your yearly government mandated medicine for XYZ or your social credit score drops\". I hate the conspiracies, don't want to believe them, but don't see any hope.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nSorry for the long post; probably half-doxxed myself, but hell, what does it matter? I'm not well; there is no hope or help to be had. Keep missing opportunities, don't have any hope for the future, wish I was dead.

I'm trying to avoid getting my driver's license for pure fear of being in an accident and being tortured like that, which makes me want to pray to die in the accident.\n\nI also developed an immense fear of needing surgery, although more manageable. To be forced naked into a room full of people looking at me, I would honestly consider just waiting to die of whatever is afflicting me, I read that you can wear cotton underwear, but they can just take it off if they judge necessary, and I can't trust them for that, even more, if the surgery has proximity to that area, like an appendectomy. This feeling just intensifies when I think about being in a coma, my body just covered by a thin layer of fabric, different people touching and seeing all my body every single day whilst I'm unconscious, unable to do anything about it, they could even put me in a shared room or don't close the door while cleaning me, a friend or family member could just walk in\u2026 if woke up from something like that I would just KMS, living with that information would be too much.\n\nHonestly, to have my heart hurt and my chest burn out of pure anxiety and panic every day by just thinking about these scenarios is making me insane, I already had some mental illness, depression, ADHD, and I'm autistic, tried to get help from 2 different therapists, but they told me \"just control your anxiety\", I don't want to die, there is so much I want to do, never fell in love, I just started my first year of college, there is so much I want to explore, but this pain is crippling me, just looking at my body when I have to go to the bathroom can start a panic attack, I would honestly rather die than to be in any of these scenarios.\n\nI had surgery on my chest when I was 14 because of Gynecomastia(increase in breast gland tissue in boys) for aesthetic\u2019s sake, I had back pain because I tried to hide it, it really made my life better, but when I remember I had to get naked for that, and everyone in the room saw me, I just\u2026 start to cry, even years later, the memory just comes back at random moments.\n\nRight now I'm still having online classes, but next year we will be in class and have to leave my home and be exposed to a number of dangers like driving and to bet victim of some sort of accident, I have already changed my diet because of the fear of developing something and needing surgery, but I know that there are things that I can't control, and I'm afraid of how I would react to them\n\nWell, I had to get this off of my chest, had no one to tell this to, thank you if you read it, I'm just desperate from the pain, I don't have anything that makes me happy in life, no goals, no interests, I'm alive just for my family to not be hurt and because just living wasn't that bad(I had attempted to KMS some months ago, told one of my friends, they didn't seem to care that much, we joked about it), but this pain, it makes me question if living is worth of this.

I\u2019m just so fed up with life and most of the time I feel like I\u2019m not living it. All my life I\u2019ve felt this barrier between myself and others, fuck even myself and myself. I know I have depression and anxiety and I\u2019m sure I have other shit too, definitely something that causes me to be a little maniac. I\u2019m also pretty much certain that I\u2019m on the spectrum to some degree. Not to mention I\u2019m also trans...so what fucking hope is there for me in life? I have no talents or hobbies. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m entirely displeasing to be around but once you see under the surface you\u2019d wish you hadn\u2019t. I\u2019m pretty much passing this school year by the skin of my fucking teeth and I can barely take it, if I don\u2019t do these two assignments tonight then I\u2019m not going to end of story. I have no plans beyond that whatsoever and I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m doing, I truly truly don\u2019t. \n\nThere was one thing that was keeping me going. A girlfriend. I loved her and I still do. Basically though - she told me at the beginning of the relationship that she was with another woman but they were both moving away from one another. I was ok with that because she pretty much told me I would be her main partner. A little less than a week ago she told me they\u2019re getting engaged. At least I had the guts to leave her...I already felt unloved in the relationship. And I\u2019m always going to be somebody\u2019s second best. I think I should be happy just to be that honestly. I just can\u2019t do this anymore man I really can\u2019t..\n\nThe thing is I\u2019m not always like this. Last night I was so happy my face hurt from smiling. Now today I\u2019m crashing and I feel just so empty. I\u2019m broken. So broken. And I want to feel beautiful but I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t. My self esteem is so low and even if I keep going on, I\u2019m never going to be comfortable with myself or love myself. I\u2019m not saying that as a choice, I just can\u2019t. I never have even as a child. I will never, ever, accept myself or love myself outside of these little manic fits I have and even then I know it\u2019s fake. I\u2019m disgusting and I hate myself for being trans so much. I hate myself for being on the spectrum - no, I haven\u2019t even accepted that fact even though I know it\u2019s true. I\u2019m just a cliche and I\u2019m never going to achieve anything. I\u2019ll end up living with my parents - maybe getting an apartment if I can get my shit together that much - until around the age of 20-22 and then I\u2019ll be gone. Like a whisper, like a ghost. I can\u2019t see myself living past twenty-two and honestly, I shouldn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be right. This is my own self-fulfilling prophecy and I\u2019m seeing it out to it\u2019s end. If I get unstable enough I may not even see 20 and I don\u2019t even want to see 19. I don\u2019t even want to see right now.\n\nThe one thing that\u2019s keeps me from it? My sister. She\u2019ll never see this but she\u2019s my best friend and I would be in an even worse place today if not for her. I love her so much and she keeps my grip on reality. I don\u2019t want to leave her alone. I want to see her live her life and be successful because she deserves it. She\u2019s so strong and the smartest, talented, beautiful person I know. Above all else, I love her empathy. She\u2019s been so patient with me and been there for me even though I\u2019ve lashed out and treated her like shit before. I haven\u2019t respected her in the way I should and that does hurt. Even when I go, I wish there was a way I could still be there for her...\n\nAnd who knows. Maybe I will see twenty-three, twenty-five, thirty or even forty. But I know it\u2019ll end in taking matters into my own hands, so to speak. I just know it will. I\u2019ve treated my mother so poorly. My dad fucked me up. But I\u2019m just a fuck-up in every sense of the word and I\u2019ve hurt so many. But really - I\u2019m just nothing. I\u2019m a ghost, I\u2019m barely here mentally and physically all the time. Just in my room never going outside...I can\u2019t even cry anymore. This is so melodramatic and I could keep going on. If you\u2019ve read through this, thank you and I\u2019m going to be hypocritical and tell you that you are lovely even though that means nothing if you can\u2019t see it yourself. I think you\u2019re all lovely, I just know I\u2019m not. And if you want a word of advice? Don\u2019t end up like me. There was a point where I could turn things around and it\u2019s basically gone now. Any opportunity I have now I know I won\u2019t take it. I\u2019m letting it slip right through my fingers.

She asked me do you want antidepressants and i was like well idk maybe not bc im scared and she was like okay.

I am new to Reddit and I don't even know if it's the right subreddit to submit my writing but I hope I could find poeple who can relate to me. If I can't, that's ok. I would be just glad to have gone through with some of my troubles here.*\n\nEver since I was in middle school, I always had this disgust and hatred towords world and myself that I cannot seem to get over. Now I think I was approximately about 11-12 years old when I discovered my abomination towords life. You may ask what could a 11 year old girl could have possibly gone through that she resents life this much. To be honest, I don't know either. I commited suicide when i was 14 and 15 but I was brought back to life each time. And each time, I was really dissapointed.\n\nNow I'm 21 and I think about killing myself every waking hour of every fucking day. There hasn't been a day that I didn't curse at my existence in this world. But I don't do it. Why, you ask. It's because I care about my parents too much to do that. Losing a child is already devastating enough, imagine losing a child to suicide! I love my parents too much to get them exposed to this kind of pain and lifetime of guilt. Which is where it gets really twisted. I don't live this life for me. I live because it's a fucking responsibility. I don't think I have enough words in my vocabulary to express how much of a painful thing this is. I don't have any dreams, passions, aspirations, talents or goals. I simply exist because I don't wan to upset my parents. Not because I enjoy living.\n\nThe second reason is that I am really afraid of not succeeding in it and having to live with some kind of disability.\n\nSo I am trapped in everyway. I can't seem to get over my past and I really do not like who I was and who I am; and I'll certainly won't like who I will be. I am 21 and I have done nothing with my life. And I am running out of time to put my life together because I was born damned. I am not supposed to be here, I wasn't supposed to exist. I don't buy that we exist for a reason crap and I certainly don't like people lecturing me about my deperssive suicidal thoughts. Even my shrink doesn't understand me.\n\nI don't have any motivation to do anything. I used to like watching movies, I am a cinema freak. But I can't even wrap my head around of a film, not even for 5 minutes. I used to like to read, now I can't focus. I am losing hope and interest in everything and I don't like the system I was born into. It's like I want to slowly fade away from existence, but something is holding me back.\n\nI am sick of living in this money-hungry imperialist world where I have to listen to some really complex shit in university lectures, just to get a little above minimum wage with no free time. We live in a world of deception. They tell us to work hard but we barely even get anything in return yet we are decieved into believing we got what we worked for. It is a fucked up system here and I don't wanna be a part of it.\n\nI really hate my major in uni and I don't have any friend. I don't know what I'm doing, and I don't know what I will do. Our financial situation is not really good.\n\nI am simply just floating, and bleeding. But I really wish to sink.\n\n*I am tired now. I am not sleepy. But tired. Of everything. It's 02:47. Everyone at home are asleep and I am awake with endless thoughts, writing this in my room knowing that it will not make a diffrence. I think often about how afraid I am to participate in life. Hell, I can't even drive. People are accomplishing things and I see waking up as a responsibility. I'm tired of waking up, I'm tired of small talks, I 'm tired of going to the local park just to feel something, I'm tired of eating, I'm tired of everything.

I've been struggling with this since before I hit puberty and now I really can't stand it anymore. I'm not sure whether my attempt will succeed or fail, but what I'm relatively certain of is that this account will not get used for a while. So here's some reflection.\n\nThroughout my life I think I have always been afraid of losing friends and being alone. But it's happened again and again, so clearly I must've failed somewhere. At first I thought that I wasn't trying hard enough or that I wasn't friendly enough, but it feels that the reason is that I'm not good enough. It seems to me that every effort I make is half-hearted, half-baked, and only half-meant. Not just socially, but in most things about my personal life. I really hate it.\n\nTo be honest, I've been scared of death for a while now, and I think it's the reason I have lived for as long as I have. Something about not having control of anything has tapped into a fear. However, right now I am more afraid of what might happen if I don't end it all. I mean, I've been in as much control as I possibly could for quite a long time, and nothing really good has come out of that.\n\nSome years ago, I used to be on some forum where suicidal people could share methods and all that. There was a general chat feature there and honestly, that was the last time I chatted openly on the Internet. I've always preferred talking in reality better, which is strange because I'm very socially awkward. But it was nice, seeing people, talking openly. I left that place because that general chat was removed (plus I read an article about police intervention?) and I haven't been able to talk like that on the web since.\n\nI don't really have a good reason or explanation for this, but I have tried to prevent this fate. I was going to a therapist who really kindly let us meet for free, but they've been busy lately and I don't want to bother them. I really do like therapy, but it's quite costly. \n\nSo yeah, I've thought about this for a long time and I'm less impulsive than the last time I attempted, so my method will be pretty sound, I think.

Whenever I hear someone young say they're depressed I just immediately think they're just a teenager, they are going through a phase and that's what I think about myself too. So I try to hide it, but whenever I express feeling like shit, I immediately start hating myself. I feel like an attention seeker 24/7. I always always feel like I'm doing everything wrong. Doesn't matter what it is, it could be only walking and I somehow find a way to shame myself for doing it wrong. ESPECIALLY when I'm around other people. My heart starts racing like crazy. I can feel my body tightening up and I observe every single thing I do at that moment and can't relax even a bit. \nMy life isn't complicated, it's very ordinary. It feels like I don't deserve any of it. I can't physically feel anything good. I find myself being totally numb from everything around me or being totally anxious about everything. Even when I'm alone I can't relax. I can't do anything I enjoy because there's nothing. I used to love music, art. I even used to love writing. But whenever I try to do anything I judge myself heavily so I can't enjoy it. It's like a constant feeling of being trapped and not being able to run away. How do you run away from your own mind? Only through drugs. Now, I really try not to do them except for nicotine, but that isn't much of a help. I often find myself dreaming about doing cocaine again. I just felt everything. It was one of the best experiences ever. I could feel my anxiety go away, I could do anything. But I know I can't. \nSo the only option I often think about is jumping out of my dorm window. Even if I don't want to do it at that moment 100%, just the thought of it makes me feel something. It's a mixture of sadness and calm. But also a fear of never ending nothingness and a fear of doing nothing good for the world.\nNow trust me, if I could I would do anything.

Over the last few years I\u2019ve dealt with extreme anxiety, depression suicidal thoughts etc. Last year I had to overcome my substance abuse issues (alchol, LSD, weed etc). I\u2019m finally being treated for my mental illnesses plus finally am diagnosed with ADHD. Over the last 6 months I\u2019ve been on around 6 different medications to help me get better. Only this last month have i started something that\u2019s improving my mental health. I am on mood stabilizers (lamotrigine) plus other things. My point is I am finally starting to get better after such a rough year. Suicide attempt, mothers second cancer + living alone with her. Even though I am on meds and am getting professional help I am still extremely fragile. \n\nMy boyfriend also struggles with mental health. He lives in a very toxic environment and has been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a while. I\u2019ve begged him to get professional help but he never has up until a week ago. Last week he asked me for drugs to help him cope, obviously i said no especially with my struggles that I am not over with. I try so hard to be there for him and do everything I possibly can as I am the only person he talks to. He has been self harming and self sabotages himself a lot. I often find myself crying when he doesn\u2019t answer because I am scared he killed himself. I don\u2019t know how to support the both of us and I feel like the worst girlfriend. Part of me is angry because I\u2019ve offered him so many resources to help him - doctors, my family etc. I physically and mentally cannot handle this and any time we talk about this he either ignores it or sobs and hits himself. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to breakup with him but even if i did i couldn\u2019t because he would probably kill himself. I can barely stay afloat myself and I don\u2019t think he realizes. I try and think i never burden him with my issues. He will dump stuff on me and then say that i shouldn\u2019t feel responsible but being the only person who knows how can I not feel responsible? I feel like such a bad person for not helping him more but with my issues, school, college apps etc, there is only so much I can do. I feel like I need to do more but I don\u2019t know how. I already dedicate most of my time to him but when I do i am left completely destroyed and empty. I stay over until 3am on a school night, stay on the phone with him until all hours. Keep in mind I am on meds so even if i feel better mentally physically I am exhausted. I feel so drained and I don\u2019t know how much longer i can keep going.

Tue. and Wed. but many students' parents make their kids go full week even on weekend. So basically my life is to wake up at 5AM, take shower then take a bus for half an hour to arrive at school, then have eight classes without interacting that makes everything so hard to understand. Finally leave school,if there's no cram school I just go home,if there is it's a blessing if I can go to bed at twelve. And why do I simply go home, well I dont really have  lots of people, and I think that's the biggest problem in my repeating boring life. I dont get any messages. even on my birthday, I remember last year I actually stay woke whole night to see who's first but no one says a word in the next two days.

I apply said creativity in coding, mostly as part of my school work. I'm on path to graduate from a Data Science degree program in the next 5 months. However, the creativity isn't capped there. My first attempt, I figured I'd apply one of my passions (plants) and go out by eating 20 or so nightshade seeds. I chewed them, let them sit under my tongue for 5 minutes, and swallowed. Nothing happened, so my best bet is that the online seller sold bunk seeds. Next time around I went for something stronger and ordered 20 wolfsbane seeds from a different vendor. I should have died in 3 hours at most that time, with there being no known antidote even if I received timely medical attention. Again, bunk seeds. \n\nLike I said, an interesting kind of creativity. Turns out that's not actually the case so much though. I've recently discovered that I'm high functioning autistic, so that plays a part in my abnormal thought patterns, interest enough. This was actually a great discovery as it made so many things make sense, and I only truly wish I'd known earlier in life. \n\nI'm a bit scattered with this post, perhaps making it hard to read, but it's a little nice to just chat with myself here. The first two times I attempted, my wife and I were in a really dark part of our marriage. It was extraordinarily toxic, and at the time I was the aggressor more than my fair share of times. There aren't any excuses for the actions I performed, the rage I exhibited and how I made my wife feel. At the time, I'd say my wife was truly the best at bringing the worst out of me; perhaps the only person who could as I was generally very level headed otherwise. Now though, I'd say it was my duty to never become what I had, no matter a cause. My wife should have been my most treasured friend at all moments. That isn't to say I believe she was never an antagonist, but I can't blame her. She was especially an angel compared to me and how badly I became consumed by my feelings of anger then. (Fun fact, I was taking Chantix around that time. Stay away from that stuff guys.)\n\nIt's coming to light that perhaps, maybe, my wife has Borderline Personality Disorder. To me, this makes sense. There are so many moments that I feel situations play out in such an interesting way, that I can't imagine what's going on is healthy. We've finally been healing from that dark place, barely but finally some progress made, and I've joined therapy for weekly visits. It's helped me see things with a little more clarity, and I can see how easy it is for my wife to maintain the status of her stance being perfectly logical and mine perfectly illogical any time we have a disagreement. Recovering from any disagreement almost requires that I speak with her in a manner that invalidates the way that I feel, as though it's not fair to her for me to be just as valid as she see's herself. Let me give an example; while my wife and I are working I have a sibling of ours watch our children. Yesterday I let my wife know that I'd be taking the last 3/4 of my shift off today so that I could catch up on school work in place of work. We discuss this and inform the boss; it's done. \n\nToday comes around and everything goes as I'd planned. I finish up work in the office and remain there for the next few hours since I'll be doing schoolwork. This was a good situation for me, as I find it very difficult to focus when anything is going on around me; generally I'll even sacrifice entire nights worth of sleep just to crash through homework while everyone sleeps. Anyhow, at about 3:50pm local time I discover my sister isn't watching my children because she's aware I put in time-off for today. This is incredibly frustrating as I put in time-off to compensate for falling behind in school; the time is still being used for necessities and, in my belief, that should have no impact on anyone's schedule. Turns out my kids have been alone and playing by themselves for hours. I take quick notice, there's a mess but I'm not immediately worried about that, and turn on cartoons before heading back to my office while leaving the door open just to finish up what I'm doing briefly. My wife arrives home and yells to me, why am I not watching our kids. I meet her and I'm aggravated, but I'm not necessarily aggravated at her. I explain what is going on, but immediately I'm told that my expectations for the day were illogical. Apparently, I didn't communicate my needs yesterday and so my wife assumed that I'd be watching the kids while doing my schoolwork. She had informed my sister that she wouldn't need to watch my children past 11:30, and my sister went to sleep when the time hit. To her, it was I who assumed wrongly for thinking anything else would happen.\n\nNow, I can live with a misunderstanding. We misunderstood each other and that's fine with me; in fact I love that because it could be an opportunity to learn more about each other. I'm frustrated, but for reasons that are understandable and I could see past it easily. What kills me though is that to my wife it's not a misunderstanding. I got upset by this and left to cool down alone. Later on I try to talk with her. I hope she has too, but I know my wife is the type that gets more angry if space is provided; unfortunately I'm the opposite in this relationship. While talking with her I learn that to her, I failed at using critical thinking skills during our conversation yesterday.; I should have wondered more about a thing or two that she said. Her stance is that her part is the only logical approach anyone would have taken, and the only reason my side makes sense to me is because of the struggles I face with autism. This unfolds (not so) beautifully and I find myself communicating that I understand where the occurred and I'll make sure this won't happen again in the future. My spouse don't find at to be a sound resolution though because I'm not expressing how I was wrong throughout the situation, how I was illogical and how my frustration was was unjustified, and how the entire result was just compounding examples of me being uncompassionate. This pushes me and I start to feel whats known as \"autistic burnout\". Some of my worst moments occur during burnout, so I leave the room to salvage peace in some sense. \n\nOnce I calm down and return, I try to level where my spouse wants me to. I express that I was wrong and I should have behaved more compassionately, that the entire situation wouldn't have occurred if only I used more critical thinking skills and questioned her more. However, this isn't a good enough solution either. At this point, the problem is now how we only address things when it's convenient for me and how every dynamic of our relationship is set up to support myself; how she receives inadequate care consistently and how today was a prime example of such. I let her talk though, and I remind myself that she's only expressing how she feels which I should remain empathetic to. She continues and expresses references something she's spoken about frequently over the past few months, that I'll be unable to save our marriage because I'm just ill-capable of being what she needs me to be.\n\nIt's logic like todays that I feel pushes so many of our problems to unprecedented heights, and alas I already said I don't blame her. That remains true, but I think a piece of me just wants a little validation. I want to hear that I'm not crazy for once, or that it's not the autism. I learned recently that validation doesn't mean you agree, it means that you recognize and accept someone's thoughts are reasonable even if you disagree. It can be meeting in the middle, and using adversity to foster commonality. I don't need to be told I'm right, in fact I hate the sound of that; just a moment of feeling like I don't have to invalidate myself to be accepted or feel loved would probably be enough to help me keep going for another year without. My wife has expressed that, from her perspective, what I'm asking for here in unfair to her in the context of our marriage; perhaps she means that I'm incorrectly applying this concept. Maybe I am and just don't see how.\n\nAnyway, when I began this I really didn't expect it to turn into a vent about what happened today. The weight of needing to save my marriage, being told I only care for myself, never receiving confirmation that it really is okay and valid for me to be a little upset about something, and constantly feeling like my best isn't good enough... it's heavy. Parts of me feel like suicide is the weak way out, but other parts of me see the sporadic nature of much of these issues and feel like nothing with get better. I said things we're getting better recently, but today shows that even while things are better nothing will have changed any time a problem arises. It shows that better only means I learn to cope with the truth that it will never change. Those aren't the only two parts of me though; another side of me thinks about how my wife will finally be free. Because the truth is, even if things aren't fair towards me, my wife isn't lying. She's expressing how she feels, and that's never a lie. With me gone, she can move on and find love somewhere more compatible to her than I was. Then there's the side of me who thinks about my kids, and there's no way I could ever justify taking their father from them. That part hurts me a lot, and it's got me crying now as I type this. I wish I could say that I could happily ride this out until things do get better solely for their sake, but something tells me \"riding this out\" just means it gets worse. Maybe \"riding this out\" means I finally find the balls to put a bullet in myself during a heated moment. I'm genuinely sorry for doing this, and I don't ever expect to be forgiven, but it feels like it's been coming for a long time now. Perhaps, if there is something out there, I can use what's left of me to watch over them and my wife. As sad as it is, that's all I can offer.\n\nThis time around I've built a mask out of a plastic 4\" plant pot and hair bands. I cut the bottom out and fastened a plastic bag over it. I'll be starting the car and going around back to allow the bag to fill with carbon monoxide et al. from the exhaust pipe. Shortly after, I'll get in the car and place the pot over my mouth and nose. With the bag containing 30,000ppm of CO, seeing as 12,000ppm can result in death within 1-3 minutes, I'm expecting to have 15 seconds or so before i pass out. I'll make sure to lie down so that I dont fall over and knock the mask off, and then I'll finally be gone. This is happening at some point tonight, as soon as there aren't others around to question my activities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for joining my TED talk everyone.

But I couldn\u2019t stay in front of it. I was scared. I was scared on what was going to be on the other side. I was scared on what I would lose. So i kept running. I made it across the street without getting hurt. This got my parents even more mad because they thought I was just being stupid and ran across the street just because I wanted to.\n\nThese thoughts never left me till this day. But in some way they inspired me. I got into sports like football and basketball. Football became my passion and I wanted it to be my future. So I told my dad that I wanted to start working out. He put a whole gym in our garage. I worked out 5 times a day for an hour a day. I started to see results and it put a smile on my face.\n\nI used  the gym as  a therapy for me. It put me in peace and I could close my eyes and realize that I\u2019m doing good for me. I am now in 8th grade and have a scholarship for football to Columbus High School who won state last year. I also met my girlfriend who has helped me through all of this. Even though all of these good things happened to me I still have suicidal thoughts.

He had a crush on me, I was a tiny black haired european/asian girl and he was exactly the same. People would think we were related, or even twins. He had a round delicate face, caramel skin and soft deep dark eyes. We bonded fast, people would catch us talking together anywhere, anytime and always like there was just the two of us. Unaware of everything surrounding us and absorbed in each other\u2019s eyes. We quickly became the cute child couple, and everyone would tease us, we didn\u2019t care, we were proud and in complete admiration of each other. But things are never perfect, he lived in another continent, in New Caledonia, a small French island near Australia. We decided to keep on with our relationships even though we lived far away and tried to make it last. Obviously, being so young and living so far were two big issues. We separated after 2 years of childish struggles, still seeing each other twice a year for tournaments but with the same unconditional pain when we had to say goodbye. It was too difficult for kids our age, so we promised each other to do everything we could to reunite one day, whenever we would be grown enough or whenever a possibility occurred. And it did, 2 years after that, he decided to move to France and go to a squash academy for young talented players, which he was, always first in his category. The opportunity was too perfect, we jumped on the occasion to reunite and stayed together for 2 years.. We both grew up far from each other and I was having lots of difficulties at home, my parents were never at home and I was feeling so lonely, even more knowing the love of my life was hundred miles apart. I needed emancipation from my parents and had a deep feeling of anger that made me cut tides with every people I cared about.. he paid the price of my mental breakdown and I decided that I was already in too much pain, I couldn\u2019t bare having a distant relationship, the relations with my parents was already too heartbreaking.. After that, we still saw each other every year for tournaments and he begged me to get back together every time we spent moments together. I wanted to say yes very bad, our love to each other was obvious and the attraction was undeniable. My strong personality and my determination to never be hurt again made me push him away over and over again.. although at times I would allow myself kissing him, seeing his amazing determination to be with me always melted my heart. He met other girls and I was very happy for him, of course I was sometimes jealous but all that mattered to me was his happiness. Unfortunately for him, a big event occurred shortly after that and he was drown to sadness and anxiety.. he had been sexually assaulted by fellow players during a tournament and this agression shattered his entire world... As a cheerful, proud and strong person, this event made him doubt all he beliefs and his built-in innocence died the day it happened. It\u2019s like I could have felt his pain, the look in his eyes and the painful smile on his face made my heart break everytime I saw him.. The change in his attitude was flagrant, he became arrogant in order to hide his pain, I knew that his pride was crushed and that was his way to keep standing. I tried several times to talk to him about this traumatic event but he acted like it was nothing and I guessed it was too hard for him to share his toughs, which I totally understood so I accepted to keep on behaving as if nothing happened. But as I expected, a year after that, he reached out to me and explained that he was struggling with his mental health, he had dark thoughts and couldn\u2019t keep them away.. He didn\u2019t want to be alive anymore, he explained that he couldn\u2019t see the meaning of life and nothing mattered to him anymore.. I did my best to be there for him, made him think about his family, his mom and all his closed friends who needed him in their lives.. I helped him with the best advices I could, but after a while something got in between us. I had met a boy and our relationship started to become very serious, this situation made him very uncomfortable and he asked me to stop talking to him. But I couldn\u2019t, my heart told me to keep on, so I lied to my \u201cnew boyfriend\u201d and kept helping him as much as I could. Every time I had moments alone I would have conversations with him and I felt it was the right thing to do.. However, after some time, it felt like cheating and my uneasy behavior started to seem more and more suspicious to my boyfriend. At last he found out and I had to make a choice.. one of the hardest one in my life. And I made the choice to go forward with my life, I already had my shares of troubles at home and things to solve out in my life, knowing I wouldn\u2019t be there for him anymore was terrible but he also had to go forward without always looking back at me.. It was hard but I took the time to cut ties with him, we had a long and deep conversations where I asked him to talk to a professional about his problems and I let him know that he will always remain my first big love and the boy who made my childhood extraordinary. That\u2019s how we ended things and I could only hope he would get the help he needed and get better. From times to times I would check his social media and scrutinize his every moves, he seemed happy with his big smile on every picture, but still, there was something in his eyes that wouldn\u2019t leave.. a hint of disillusion/trauma that I could spot through all his photographs. 2 years later, he was participating in a tournament close to the place I live so I decided to join him. I had left the boyfriend I had and it was the perfect opportunity for me to check on him. We had a great time that day, we talked about our lives and the conversation could go on and on, the attractiveness between us was forever present, he was still my unbreakable magnet. He had earned a scholarship in the United States and was leaving two months after that, I was so happy for him, the American dream he always talked about was about to come true, there was nothing that could make him unhappy. Nonetheless, I could catch from times to times the same look on his face, the look that made me feel that he was screaming on the inside.. but this time, he managed to smile it away when he was looking at me. At the end of the day we had to say goodbye and we both felt it could be the last time we saw each other, the heartbreaking farewell we both feared was ultimately here. I didn\u2019t want to show him my fear, the fear of letting him go into this wild world and not knowing what was up for him. But I hid my emotions and hugged him very tight, wishing him all the best, I started to tear up and he asked me not to be sad. He was smiling at me and told me he had one last request, a kiss. A farewell kiss. I hesitated and looked at him with an amused exasperation, he looked at me with a teasing loving smile which made me let go of all my apprehension and I put my lips against his for one last time. Perfect as always. \n4 years went by, and I kept spying on him from times to times on social media, he had made many friends in the United States and he was succeeding in everything. He seemed to have so much fun, lots of students parties, lots of girls, lots of titles in the sport he loved so much. But there were a few details that caught my attention, he kept changing haircuts, he was behaving \u201cextra\u201d on pictures and being very silly, I don\u2019t know why but it made me feel as if his internal struggle was not over. About 8 months ago, my unconscious mind started to feel very bad for him, and I started talking about his problems to my closest friends and family, they all knew what he had been going through but they wouldn\u2019t believe he was not being well, everything on his social media made people think he was the happiest person in the world. But I could feel from my guts that something was wrong. On top of that, the boy who had assaulted him was trying to come back to competition, and I did everything to stop him, I called every institutions, my hatred toward this person was growing even more. I succeeded at stoping him and I guess that the fact that I could see that this trauma still had a huge impact on his life made very angry. My family and friends thought my activism was strange but I did what I had to do, it was my way of protecting him even though he was miles away. My instinct told me I had to do it. But strangely, I was feeling like something was still wrong, I started thinking about him more and more everyday. \nOn December 13th, his family told me about his passing. He has ended his life the night before. Heartbreak, disbelief, disgust, anger, pain, sorrow... but also guilt, terrible disappointment, remorse, regrets and so many more. I will forever cherish the time we spent together and forever regret how things worked out for him, if I could I would do everything so differently. But what is done is done, true love never fades and memories will forever be locked in my heart. \n\nTo the lover that I lost, farewell.", "title": "To the lover that I lost.

Besides  from that, last month and this month has been horrible.   It started off as finding someone I loved, to ruining their life a week later.  For the past month, I've been trying to gain weight and have a good eating schedule.  I'm one pound away from my goal, but this isn't the first time I've been here.  Every time I get to this spot, I always go back down 2-4 pounds.  And my eating schedule?  I've lost it.  I'm forgetting to eat and at this point, I hope it kills me.  I'm just starting to get tired of everything, ruining my friends lives, being sad all the time, and hating my body.

I just couldn't keep up in my honors algebra class and thought that basically meant my life was over. I remember feelings of guilt and shame. I had a bad habit of catastrophizing things back then that I have not really outgrown. I remember having a conference with my guidance counselor and my math teacher at the time. I went home that day and drank some hydrogen peroxide and some mouthwash. I don\u2019t think I really wanted to die in that moment, I think in the back of my mind I knew what I was consuming was not going to be enough to kill me. I certainly got sick enough though and can remember being in the bathroom vomiting when family members started to come home for the day.\n\nThe second time was much more serious. I was in the second year of my college degree studying engineering and feeling like the biggest impostor in the world. My habit of catastrophizing things had stuck around and I had only gotten worse at being honest with my friends and family. I remember sitting across the table from a friend who had come to visit me in Worcester at the time and casually browsing through the google results for \u201cTall bridges/buildings near me\u201d as if I were a late night drinker looking for some casual food. One night I was feeling particularly desperate and actually reached out to a sucide prevention service. I remember texting the woman on the other end and she kept asking me where I was. I had no thoughts of self preservation at the time, in fact I only felt embarrassed. I was scared the police were going to come take me out of my dorm, march me down the hallway of my co-ed dorm, my roommate would know, my lab partner that I had a thing for would know, and my parents would know. I\u2019d never be able to fully put the mask on again and everyone would know I was some fucked up suicidal mess. I exited the chat. \n\nI started reading all sorts of forums. I read about various gas and trash bag methods, I thought about throwing myself on the tracks down by Union Station. The nagging guilt in the back of my mind and thoughts of my mom made me want to die peacefully and leave behind a non mutilated corpse. Two days later I managed to procure five quarter gram Halcion pills otherwise known as Triazolam. It was the last Monday before Thanksgiving break 2017, my roommate had gone home Sunday night. Around 7 pm on Monday night I started drinking hard liquor. At 8 pm I took all 5 halcion and finished the bottle of liquor. I made sure my dorm was locked and climbed up the ladder to my bunk, I drifted off fully intending to not wake up again.  \n\nI woke up on Wednesday. It felt like my heart wasn\u2019t beating at all and there was no water left inside of my body. For some reason when I woke up I wanted to live again. I was in a bad way, I tried to get out of my bunk but I was too weak and fell down the ladder. I laid on the floor broken and crying for what felt like hours.\n\nIn December of 2017 I finally told my mom what was happening to me and what I had done to myself. That conversation caused my mom immense pain, my guilt increased, the mask didn\u2019t fit the same way anymore. On december 21st 2017 I went into a two week inpatient program. I left there with a new prescription and that\u2019s about it. \n\nIt\u2019s 2021 now and things have been okay for me for a while. I have income, I have a warm place to stay and I'm blessed enough to actually have a couple of really good emotionally intelligent friends that care about me and I deeply care about them. They don\u2019t know any of this. I still have suicidal thoughts. Honestly I have them all the time. Sometimes I\u2019ll have a good month, sometimes I think I won\u2019t make it to the end of the month. Honestly my life is not that bad now. I had some childhood trauma, I\u2019m your typical kid with a parent who heavily abused substances and there is schizophrenia on both sides of my family. I don't think that\u2019s my problem. I am just so god damn apathetic. I don\u2019t care about anything anymore. Lately the little pangs of suicidal ideation I get are like a thrill sometimes that breaks up my ceaseless apathy. I feel like I have no control of my emotions. The dumbest things can send me into a rage. No one sees me like this and I don't have an abusive bone in my body, the rage is usually focused on myself or inanimate objects. I feel so lost but at the same time I don't. I worry that I am so angry but also I don't care, or maybe i'm just exhausted at this point.\n\nI\u2019ve thought about opening up again. Getting back on meds or even just for once being honest with my friends and allowing them to really see me. \n\nHow do you lay something like that at someone\u2019s feet. How could you add so much stress and worry to the life of someone that you claim to care about so dearly. Even if I did open up, i\u2019m not sure there is anything that can fix what\u2019s wrong with my head.

We moved around between continents and that was very damaging. It would've been great if my dad took the lower salary and we stayed in the city they were originally in. We had to live in shitty (but \"glamorous\") places for that affluence. I just now realised that the unhappy feeling I felt back then was deep loneliness.

In fact, with your confidence beaten to a pulp, the golden launching pad becomes a comfortable but deadly golden cage. \n\nYou know what that looks like? Never having worked. Staying in a place you hate so you can graduate because obedience has been so drilled into you and because you didn't learn how the world works AT ALL in the shitty glamorous place you grew up in.

You need assertiveness, even narcissism to succeed in the big city. Jealous relatives  who you were brainwashed to never talk back to (rEsPeCt yOuR elDeRs!) further eroded your confidence. Your sibling who escaped the disgusting submission and obedience because they had the luck of rebelliousness is unfortunately a complete cunt to you. So you have no proper guidance.\n\nAnd all the while the success and opulence and pleasure and hotness you couldve had long ago is paraded in front of you everyday in this most auspicious of cities, and every day and night this is a dagger to the heart. Sorry but I don't need to play that game. \n\nIm not bad looking. I have a good body. But I'm now 27 and feel like a child. No job.

I feel that. And I'll have to spend more years just to maybe get a job so I can maybe earn enough to move out and be independent so I can have lots of sex and relationships. I have to live with toxic family still. Its too expensive to move out without a high salary where I live. And the cherry on top is the covid recession (no jobs and more competition) and one fucking pill of Zoloft gave me extreme fatigue and sexual dysfunction. I'm falling apart trying to pick up the pieces and it's thankless and exhausting. I'll keep working towards it. Maybe. Everyday and every moment I wonder when I'll finally be happy for the first time in my life. \n\nAt the risk of doing a counterfactual, at the end of the day my affluent background was for nothing and in fact was even detrimental. Very detrimental. Probably fatal. Money isn't everything.\n\nHere is the thing, the grander scheme. We are not evolved for modern society. We are hunter gatherers, and they generally had/have it better than us. It has been shown that they work less and don't even view it as work. They are more egalitarian and they are healthier. Today in the rich developed world they've tried to make it more tolerable (more like our hunter gatherers past) so you can enjoy golden chains. Maybe the lucky ones who make it in the city and fuck every night and go out every weekend have more pleasure (or maybe they don't. After all they work more and have more stress). But the modern way of life still doesn't work for everyone. The nuclear family and school is not \"natural\". Society is created by us and therefore its creation and development is natural, but in and of itself it's unnatural since our evolution is so slow and 95% of our history has been spent in hunter gatherer tribes in nature. And if you had an unfortunate childhood you're set back in life.  Hence we have things like chronic stress and suicide that you don't see in hunter gatherer tribes.", "title": "Money isn't everything after all"}, {"created_utc": 1613688046, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lmzh8u/im_gonna_kill_myself/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Im doing fine, school is going well, I have a job, I am in love with this adorable girl.

If you do read this all then bare with me because I'm sure it will be a mess to read. \n\nEvery day is the same now. I wake up, feeling motivated to better myself &amp; fight, but then by the end of it, my mind goes AWOL &amp; I'm back to telling myself what i have been for the past 5 years or so; this time just so much more frequent &amp; more severe. \n\nI've been at the same job since I finished High school &amp; I work a lot, mainly to try to not deal with the intrusive thoughts I get in a form of distraction, but it doesn't really work when it's not busy like it is this time of year. A few weeks ago, I worked 60 hours, &amp; this week I'm about 52 hours into the 70 I'm pushing for this week. There are a few good people, but a few terrible ones. I'm grossed out by a few, one who I've seen in the lunch room watching porn twice(&amp; a friend did as well another time), and also the way he looks at children really scare me. He wasn't even written up for those incidents as he's one of the few people who can do a few certain things, so the company refuses to do anything about it. They also 'promote' mental health &amp; safety, but the only worker who has been diagnosed with Anxiety &amp; takes medication for it, gets bashed behind her back by supervisors and when I 'joked' about my mental health being shit this week, my supervisor said \"You're sounding like \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, god what a bitch.\" The only redeeming thing about the place is that we allow customers to bring their pets in so I do get to see a few dogs almost everyday.\n\nAs I said, I'm young, But I don't know what to do. My life has been very fortunate, but I've still struggled with mental Illness &amp; the last thing I want to do is cause anymore pain. My parent's have sacrificed a lot for me, from putting me through any sport I wanted to putting me in private school while also having to look after our grandmother who we moved to live with once she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. They've helped me with my ADHD &amp; done everything they can to make sure I have the medication that would help best. I've even been able to live at home for the past few years without having to pay board or for anything really.  I feel like a burden &amp; really feel like it would be easier if I gone, which I feel they would see after I'm gone, but I know the initial shock would be terrible along with the fact my mother would believe it was her fault, when I know she (&amp; my dad) have done everything they possibly could. I almost wish bad on our life so I could have reason in my family's eyes as for the action I want to do so badly. \n\n I've had a relationship with a girl who I love since 2017, but because of crazy anxiety(for very valid reasons which I could never betray her trust &amp; talk about her past) I never went to University yet although I was accepted when I applied two years ago. We've never met yet as she lives overseas &amp; I live in North America, which I would have already met if Covid didn't ruin my travel plans last summer. If I don't give up, then I plan to go back to school. I'm looking overseas, mainly at the University where she is from &amp; another close by incase I can't get in at hers. After that we started to grow a part a little bit, but she is still someone who I couldn't live without. We spent almost every night falling asleep on facetime &amp; we'd frequently call &amp; watch Netflix, YouTube, or just talking about our day. I have lied a lot to her in the past, mostly about past relationships with friends when we first starting dating, &amp; since then she has had doubts. I love her so much, but I know I've attempted actions that have been trying to self-sabotage myself because I really think she deserves the best, which I don't believe is me. I have succeeded in that, &amp; we have barely talked in the last while. \n\nI have had plans to kill myself for a long time. I know how selfish it is because I have been given so much, but the thought doesn't go away, &amp; I don't want to be remembered for the good if I do go through. She is struggling massively because of lockdowns where she is from, &amp; I've not been afraid to help  out when she wasn't able to afford rent or even food some months. but she is still in debt because of it. I've thought of taking out a school loan which would be a lot thanks to being an international student(my grandmother left enough money for me to use for school only when she passed so I've been told I don't have to worry about cost of Uni ) so if I still struggle during the fall semester &amp; when I'm actually with her, I can give that money to her before I die. I'd be keeping my promises of getting to her, never being with someone else, along with the date I owe her at her favorite restaurant, but also leave her in a good position through the loan(which would be forgivable if I died-Thank you \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ government) &amp; what I have make from work so she didn't think I was just leaving her through one of the hardest times of her life(that is if she doesn't leave me by then fully due to the self-sabotage, which is okay because the news would hopefully hurt less.)", "title": "I'm just drained &amp; don't feel like fighting"}, {"created_utc": 1613687677, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lmzc6d/nvm/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "i posted about getting help since i tried to commit few weeks ago. but the desire to just wanna end it all is stronger. i give up. getting help will just complicate things. maybe i am taking the easy way out, but not everyone is built to fight.", "title": "nvm"}, {"created_utc": 1613687589, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lmzb0n/literally_only_living_for_other_people_at_this/", "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am in the (un)fortunate position that I have people who care about me, and would be devastated if I punched out early.

He has quite a record.  Her had several restraining orders against him.  He had just got out of jail a month before we meet and I didn't know it.  He was accused of raping his ex girlfriend and I honestly believe he did it.  He's not a good man and I obviously can't be with him.  I hurt so much though.  We were together 6 months.  We were engaged.  We were talking about having a baby.  My clock is ticking for having another baby.  I thought I was about to have a stable family for me and my son. I thought I was going to get the opportunity to be in a good position to bring another life into the world and get married and build with someone.  Instead I had to get a restraining order and pack all his things and give back the prettiest engagement ring.  Now I'm alone again with my son.  I'm so broken hearted.  I don't want to be on this planet.  I don't want to live. I know my baby needs me but I also keep thinking about my beautiful successful younger sister who is engaged to the best guy.  I just keep thinking she could do better for him. He could be happier with her. He could have a little sibling and a mom and dad with her. I could jump.  I could go to the bridge and jump.

So first of all, i had an ED (i'm recovered now) and i used to post pics of myself to trigger people, and i was proud of being able to trigger people because this meant, to me that i was doing it right. People would warn me about the underage boys &amp; girls, using me as thinspo, starving themselves BECAUSE of me etc...I knew. I just didn't care about it. Then, there was a person under my comment section. He would say pretty f*cked up things about me and my body, but i liked it because it validated my ED. Then i realized he was preying on a young girl under my comment section. But i was so full of myself. I ignored it. And i didn't listen to the girl when she told me about it and asked for help, she ended up almost killing herself because of this. I didn't block him, report him or tried to help the girl. The only thing i was thinking about was myself and myself only. I let it happen. After a few months later, and i had a friend, let's call her J. We were friends for a year, we met on the internet. At some point, she started to worry about my ED and she realized my parents wouldn't do sh*t about my situation so she put me into forced treatment. I didn't like it, so i called her a bully, hater and cut all the connection she had to me. But that wasn't the worst thing i did. I was so angry and i wanted to hurt her so bad. I compared her to a guy that was sexually assaulting girls, body shaming them and bully them. I know i traumatized her with this. She only wanted to help and i did this to her. Then after this, i was getting backlash from people for being a pro ana account, triggering girls etc. As a response, i used my grandma's disease to get sympathy and silence people. I also changed my voice and acted like a baby so people would think i was an innocent girl who didn't know better due to my condition. But that wasn't the reality.\n\n\nI know i can't take what happened back, and force you to forgive me. But all i can say is that i'm sorry and i acknowledge the harm i did.

I am experiencing the first time in my life I have ever been really suicidal without being depressed?  Like don't get me wrong, I had incredibly bad depression as a teenager and I got through that. I know what that's like, I'm not and I was not scared to talk about it.  I'm not sad.  I don't feel regret or remorse.  Just to like give that background info.  Like aside from the emotional strain of feeling suicidal, I am fine, emotionally speaking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor about a decade I have been experiencing the effects of what is probably CTE.  There is the probably, because they can't diagnose it without disecting your brain after you kick it.  I don't know what the months or the days of the year are anymore, I have had a non-stop headache since I was 12, my ears randomly ring, I can't recognize faces, I can't understand people without reading their lips, I am hard to understand when I talk, I am starting to have trouble breathing, and I forget almost everything after a few minutes.  To put it briefly, I was beat a lot as a kid and now my brain is dying.  But life is good.  I am a youtuber (because like, no in person job can accomadate me), I'm getting married later this year, I do the things I enjoy, I am really enjoying my life and that makes this weird.  Because I feel like I need to die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething that tends to happen early in CTE is that people lose their emotional regulation.  And I am like, definitively in the late stages and I just didn't have problems like that at all, so I just figured that part of my brain wasn't affected.  But then like a couple months ago I started having these moments.  I feel totally fine everything is good and then something loud happens or I get hurt or something like that and then suddenly...  I just watch my body do things out of my eyes.  She punches things or throws things or yells at people and like all I feel is horror as my body just acts on adrennaline without my agency and then suddenly I am just dumped back into my body.  And I have to make sense of what just happened, to try to make it right.   And at first I thought, maybe it's just like dissociation to help my consious mind not feel guilt, but it has happened enough times at this point, that I know that it's not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just do not know what else to do.  I am the kind of person where everyone who knows me would tell you they have literally never seen me angry.  Like one time I tried to be mean to a store employee and my best attempt was to say thank you, turn around, and then wisper, \"that wasn't very nice.\"  And now I have thrown stuff at my cat screamed at my fiancee, punched a door off it's hinges (wheelchair users have strong arms).   And it terrifys me because I just don't know what to do because I can't control it.  It's like I get carjacked but the person pushes me into the passenger seat, drives off a bridge, and then jumps out while it is hanging in the air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I am just like soooo frustrated because I had finally gotten to the point that I accepted that I was dying and that other people needed to care for me and that's okay, that I essentially had alzheimers in my 20s, because, whatever, if my brainstem starts to go, there are pacemakers for your lungs and your heart and feeding tubes are just a backpack now and they make meds to keep you from choking on your spit.  Like I was so excited to just keep experiencing more of the world and living life and being happy.  And then this shit shows up?  It is so dumb.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike, how do I ethically keep living if I know my dying brain could literally hurt someone?  How is that fair?  How can I put that on the world?

I do not want to bore anyone with details, but I need to let it out.\n\nI\u2019ll start off by saying I\u2019m 17f. I recently hit 7 months of sobriety off narcotics, got a job, and got into all colleges I applied to. Things were going well. I am not going to go into detail as to why I quit my job because it is NSFW, but I ended up quitting about a week and a half ago. A day or two after I quit, I relapsed on Xanax (contained fentynal) and ODd in front of my mom on Mother\u2019s Day. Before anyone says anything, I know it was selfish. I am aware I make awful decisions but no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to stop myself. Every night since I have been getting high, and my parents found out today as they did a drug test. Now they are not paying for my tuition, I only have 4k in my checkings and I have no job. \n\nI have isolated myself from all of my friends, dumped my boyfriend after ghosting him for a week, and have started failing my classes. I have absolutely 0 motivation nor do I have the motivation to try. I almost feel like maybe I\u2019m just a shitty lazy person and I don\u2019t actually have clinical depression. For fuck sakes, I cant even shower twice in a week or do laundry, how am I going to survive at college?? I can\u2019t even pay for it now so I am not even going, and I will probably get kicked out and end up on the streets homeless doing harder drugs. \n\nI don\u2019t even know where I am going with this. All I want is to be happy, but I am actively destroying my life. I can\u2019t make excuses for it anymore. I pathologically lie to my parents, I am always looking for an excuse to relapse, and I just.... I give up. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to my trauma than what I have revealed to my parents. I was sexually abused and groomed for 3 years by a 47 year old man they don\u2019t even know exists. I was touched in grade 1 for months by a bunch of grade 8s. I have been r*ped multiple times, and have been through more than I could and would ever want to share with them. I can\u2019t tell them all of this now, they would only get more upset with me and call me a liar. \n\nIn the end, I give up. I can\u2019t go to college, I can\u2019t get a job right now since my province is on lockdown, I got my car taken away, I don\u2019t have any friends and I dumped the one person in my life who makes me happy.

Today he comes up to me in the living room, saying he's driving his son (who is with us for the summer as well) back to his ex wife's house tomorrow, and he's not coming back to our town. He says all the titles to the car, truck, and his Harley are in my name in the case of his death, and that he's transferring all the money in his account to me. He's talked like this before at the thought of losing me. He's a combat Marine, saw 2 tours in Iraq, has lost multiple friends to suicide, and I'm afraid he's serious he might actually do something. I was a Navy Corpsman and have had to hold people on suicide watch, and one of them actually went through with it as soon as he separated from the Navy. I've lost other friends to this as well. The military did a number to us, so I've always had a soft spot for someone with PTSD because I 100% believe that we'reall we got after we get out. I've seen too much of this, but for some reason I don't know how to handle it this close to home. It has been 2 years of absolute emotional ruin for me trying to help him.

I need to leave him for my sanity and the mental health of my son because our relationship is just toxic, but I'm afraid he will actually kill himself. He has no other family, none of them talk to him any longer. He claims his kids hate him and wouldn't care if he was gone. I'm considering telling his ex wife about it so when they meet to swap their son tomorrow she can call authorities if she needs to.

Before I continue I want to say clearly that I have never watched CP in my life or never will and I will never in my life would do anything to a kid, I would rather kill myself any day. This started when I was them same age as other girls but as I got older my attraction my attraction didn't go away. I am still attracted to older women and women of my age. But the weird part is that I am not really attracted to the young girls when I see them  IRL,I just see them as I would see a kid no other thoughts, but when their image pops into my head or I see a picture of them on the internet(not CP regular pics) I get very aroused. And also I don't have ever really have fantasies about them as my brain immediately blocks out such vile thoughts. The attraction is very hit or miss but I know for sure that it happens.)\n\nI am attracted to adult women. I get off very easily while watching porn on the internet but it is mostly because I kinda make myself believe that I am normal. I do get turned on by them but it is just a little lesser than all my other attractions(maybe because I have watched so much porn in my life with women that I am used to it and it takes me longer to get fully aroused). I do often get fantasies about being in love with a gf in the future and I can sometimes get super aroused by it but sometimes I don't feel a lot. I do get very aroused when watching pegging or femdom videos.\n\nI am also attracted to men(my most intense attraction out of all). I have fantasies about being a sub being dominated and I instantly get a very powerful arousal. I kept convincing my self that is just a phase and I kept watching normal porn with kinkier fetishes but after sometime I gave in I watched some Fpov (pov of a female giving a blowjob) porn and it probably the best feeling I have had in while. I also get aroused maybe a little less by thinking about being a dom.\n\nI am also attracted to trans people(not as much as men) and many of the other genders. I watched trans porn and I get off it the same as female porn.\n\nI also did an experiment on my self in the shower. I tried to think of the different things I am attracted to and check how hard my penis gets. In different scenarios all of them are equally arousing but if I had to rank them it would be.1)Men(got aroused very quickly).2)pubescent girls.(this fucking kills me).3)pegging/Femdom 4)Women,trans and all the other genders.\n\nI know that some of these attractions are more acceptable in society nowadays even where I am from(not America). I was doing very good at school a year and a half ago but these thoughts are killing me. I can't use anything except Youtube distraction because I know I will search for info on my attraction and will find people who would gladly kill me for my attractions for the girls. I found multiple studies that say that the attraction to young girls is very prevalent in society but most people don't act on it and that only 20%-35% of child sexual abuse is done by people with such attractions and the others are not ones who are attracted to young girls. But that doesn't change peoples belief that people like me are surely going to do some vile shit. This makes me even more depressed and I will probably take this attraction to my grave.\n\nI don't know if will ever say even the other kinda normal attractions to my parents(maybe when I am older). I think I am defo going to Hell but I do have one question for God considering this crap is real, Why make me this way??? I DONT WANT THESE ATTRACTIONS. I have cried over this, why make me suffer with these thoughts. I just want to be a normal kid. My grades and my life is falling apart. Whenever I go to the kitchen and see knives I have awful thoughts about hurting myself I just don't have the balls to do it. My depression has eased out a little but I comes back in waves. \n\nTLDR; I have attraction towards men, women, other genders and pubescent(13 and over girls). I don't want any of this, I am depressed, fell from a good student to the bottom of my class and I have suicidal thoughts that I am too pussy to go ahead with.\n\nMy brain says the easiest way out of this is to just study well, grow up, use my half decent personality, marry a girl, have a family and use all my power to push all of this deep inside of my head and make sure it never comes out.\n\nwhat should I do about this?", "title": "Please help I am a 16M, I need serious help about my sexual attractions."}, {"created_utc": 1624724697, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o8dzuh/i_am_so_alone/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "For a while now I\u2019ve been overwhelmed and stressed and constantly upset but I\u2019ve been holding it all together because my boyfriend has some mental health issues that we\u2019ve been trying to work through.

I wanted to share everything to be closer to him. And then he started using me. It took me a long time to get over it, even thought it was only 4 days.

I regret everything I've done.\n\nI've always been rather unpopular and asocial. Gotten bullied a few times. You know how some people dare each other to confess or kiss or ask out X person? Because X is disgusting, because X is unlikable, because people hate X? I'm X. I've always been X. If my classmates were playing that game and that dare happened, i was always X. \n\nMy parents are. Well. My father screams a lot and has said stuff like i deserved to be bullied because I'm insufferable, among other things. And my mother is manipulative. My brother is their ultimate protector, for some reason I can't think of. I hate eating with people around me, I'm never hungry at lunch, I feel guilty for leaving food, and I'm generally picky and don't eat much. Did you guess my parents force me to eat? Yeah.\n\nI have one friend in real life. The rest are either online or moved away. That friend has more friends. All of them do. They're the only people i care about. They're busy with their lives. \n\nI used to have more. In March I fucked up royally and got banned out of the server where my friends were. It was for the best. I'm a toxic person. That I've come to terms with. My former partner, who i was really close friends with, cut off ties with me and it was just a month ago that I stopped loving them. Some days I regret not shutting the fuck up. If I had, i wouldn't be writing this here, I'd be chatting with my friends and being a mildly happy kid. If I could meet the me that fucked up, I'd kill them. They ruined my life. And they're me.\n\nI have diagnosed anxiety. I'm pretty sure I'm depressed. I could have untreated ADHD. \n\nOne of my former friends called me an attention whore and that thought persecutes me. It's always hanging over my head. I don't think it'll leave.\n\nI feel replaceable. I feel like my friends could get over me easily. I feel so lonely. My friends and I havent had a real conversation in days because they're busy with life and are mentally ill too. I don't want to burden them but I learnt my lesson and i won't bottle up anything anymore.\n\nI call myself trauma. I'm just trauma. I'm just everyone's mistakes. In one hand, i know i have to change. I have to overcome my trauma (what trauma? You're perfectly okay) to stop being toxic and to be happy, at least. I have to work on myself if I want to be happy.\n\nIn the other hand. It's too much. And for what? I always find a way to fuck myself up further, I'll never be okay. What's the point? I've given up on being happy. I don't want to get better and i don't want to work on myself. It's too much. (You're so fucking lazy, that's why.)\n\nI didn't ask for any of the trauma (what trauma?). I didn't ask for it, i didn't want it, i am a fucking victim. Why do I have to solve the problems i didn't cause? Why am I responsible of something i didn't do? \n\nI've forgotten what happiness feels like. I'm currently going to therapy, have since May 2020. It feels like it's for nothing. I always get worse.

I'm so tired. And I can't go on anymore. I'm so tired. It's too much. Living is too much. It never guarantees I'll ever feel happy anymore. I'm not going to solve my shit just to get nothing in return. \n\nI choked myself an hour ago. It felt good. What reason do I have to not go all the way? It's so easy. It's really so easy.

But I do hope someone with the answer reads this though. \n\nSo many things the past 4 years has lead me to this dark place. I was fine the first couple years. I got knocked down and kept getting back up and kept hope things would improve. But friends and family that I thought were supportive lied on me, stole, used me &amp; ghosted me when I was no longer convenient or useful to them. \n\nWhat hurts the most is I was always there tor these people over the years - at one point my life was great and I was a good \u2018family man\u2019 and friend. But after my dad died a few years ago and my mother got very sick &amp; I left my job and cared for her and then everything for me started on a downward roll. And it\u2019s almost as if my friends/family enjoy seeing me struggle and even do things to make it more difficult like \u2018kick me when I\u2019m down\u2019 \n\nAnyway..... I\u2019m in a very toxic living situation, so depressed I cant work, watching my mother waste away with no regard for her son having to watch it happen. She\u2019s a narcissist (and I didn\u2019t come to that term lightly) I realize she lost her husband but the last two years she\u2019s not showered, refuses to see doctors, doesn\u2019t take medicine and expects me to be all smiles and take care of her. She\u2019s heard from my aunt that I\u2019m depressed, Sucidial and drinking yet she doesn\u2019t care &amp; makes NO effort to help me help her. It\u2019s HARD watching a family member die in front of you slowly wasting away with no support from anyone at all. My only living family member is my aunt and she\u2019s in Chicago and made it clear she\u2019ll pray for me but that\u2019s it.\n\nI saw a therapist last week and we talked through everything and she advised me to coordinate with DEFAC (elder care DEFAC) and get someone to care tor my mother because my mental and physical health has deteriorated so much and I\u2019m In crisis. My mother is in her right frame of mind she just refuses to do anything for herself and it\u2019s run me into the ground. She told me to pack and leave &amp; let the Elder Care know that I can no longer live here and I am washing my hands of it. \n\nI realize this may be the only way I can save myself but leaving is scary. Leaving everything and everyone I know (even if they are toxic) scared me. It makes me feel that maybe pulling the trigger is the best way. I\u2019m in such a dark place EVEN if I leave will that be enough to pull me out?  \n\nI don\u2019t even know where to go. I have NO family that I could stay with, so I\u2019d be leaving everything going out on my own leaving my mother to these people and that\u2019s going to be enough to get me out of this suicidal depression? I feel the thought is scaring me and making me just want to end it also. \n\nThere is someone in California that I\u2019ve talked with for a couple years, we haven\u2019t met in person we only know about each other through our conversations.

And all the insight and guidance that this community provides. I've only lurked a bit, so please forgive me if these questions are redundant, as I am sure they have been covered many times in a support-oriented group like this.   \n\n\nI don't know what else to do and I don't have anywhere else to turn. I've been struggling with this stuff since I was probably 12 or 13 (about to turn 30). All throughout I have made what I refer to as passive attempts on my life through intentionally reckless choices and substance abuses, all the while resigning myself to something finally taking me away from here. In my mind I have always assumed I would kill myself eventually, and that it was not a matter of \"if\" but a matter of \"when.\" I had resolved to take matters into my own hands and end it about 8 years ago, made my peace with people and said my so-called \"goodbyes\" only to stick around because I had found some decent distractions that took me away from the pain for a while. Things were definitely better, and I have been very proud of myself in keeping around. Even in light of those distractions, I've still been fixated on getting out. The only thing I ever think about anymore is the end - it's been the primary thing in my life for so long and I just can't fathom being alive much longer. Every day, it's the forefront of my thoughts, from the time I wake until I eventually pass out. I have people that I love dearly, and even the thought of hurting them doesn't motivate me to stay topside anymore.   \n\n\nCovid has been especially hard for me - I've been separated by an international border from my fiancee for the better part of a year and a half, my closest family is ten hours away (and we're on better terms than we used to be but still somewhat estranged), all of my creative outlets were put on permanent hold, several people close to me have died this year, and I have been leaning especially hard into my addictions as my means of escape. I am a really awful alcoholic and in a service industry job that facilitates a lot of extra-curricular drinking. I can feel my body breaking down. I am so tired.   \n\n\nI'm not sure what I am looking for. I am not religious and I don't want this to become a religious conversation because that does not comfort me. I guess I would like to know what keeps the rest of you going when you're in the absolute depths of it (and recognizing that this shared experience has been absolute havoc on everyone, to their own personal degrees which I will never fully comprehend). I genuinely don't want to give up just yet, because I feel like there's nothing left for me to lose (and I actually see that as a good thing).  My mindset has been that if I stay alive and keep enduring all of this, it's pain that I'm used to and therefore can tolerate, but if I end things, yes, it's release but that's finally it. That's all. But in the past I have felt enough fringe \"optimism\" to want to tough it out and increasingly I don't see the point. Instead, I increasingly fixate on the immediate release, or even worse (to me), I imagine a life where I actually make it out and things get happy and then eventually I lose the people that I care about one by one each year to the void.

I was able to afford my apartment at school with the money from my scholarship/job and my best friend as my roommate. I could even pretty much buy whatever groceries I wanted, a couple streaming services, eat out once or twice a week, go bowling/see a movie, etc. and still have money to save. I thought I was stressed with school and the pandemic, but I knew that being away from my toxic family and generally supporting myself was the most freeing thing I'd ever experienced - and helped my depression a lot. \n\nNow I've had to move back home with my family, whom I fight with all the time (or more accurately, they yell at me about things like leaving my clothes in the dryer for a day, or eating in my room, or working too much, or not babysitting my sister, or going to spend the night at my boyfriend's, or not spending enough time with them - even though they can be very mentally and verbally abusive). \n\nI have struggled to find a decent job even after applying to almost 100 in the past handful of months. The one that was desperate enough to hire me (apparently) was for a company I always imagined was my dream job at a big theme park (you'd know it if you heard the name), where I thought everything was going to be energetic and about providing a great guest experience. Turns out it's just toxic, I'm severely underpaid, and they keep giving me more responsibilities beyond my job description. I haven't had two consecutive days off in almost a month and they work me weird shifts constantly (for instance, a 2-11, then a 9-5, then an 11-5, etc). They even went back on days I had specifically approved off more than three weeks in advance, because they \"need the help\" and I'd be fired if I refused. I drive almost an hour there and back every day just to get there, which I was fine with before I realized how shitty the job environment there is.\n\nI got a 4 year degree in Hospitality and Tourism just to work my ass off constantly for $11/hr (with NO benefits) doing tasks below my skill level AND work my boss just doesn't feel like doing (at a higher level than the rest of the team, because they're obviously not qualified for that level of college-degree-required type work). I know I need to ask for a raise now that they've given me way more projects that are outside of the job I was initially hired for, but my bosses are so toxic I expect they'll say no and I will want to quit  even more from the anxiety and how undervalued I feel there.\n\nBut I can't afford to quit, because even though my parents are allowing me to live in their house, they decided to kick me off of their insurance policies now that I'm \"an adult\". I have severe dental problems that were mostly covered by my university's student healthcare policies, until I graduated and found out they messed up two fillings, but I would have to pay full price out of pocket with no insurance to fix now that I'm not a student. So I'm going without fixing those, and haven't been able to chew on the left side for months now. Another reason why I need a better job with actual benefits, even though no one seems to want me. \nI have a couple of speeding tickets I got almost 2 years ago as a dumb college student that are now making the quotes I'm getting for car insurance insane so another thing to worry about affording.\n\nMy boyfriend has an amazing job, a great career, tens of thousands in savings, and we talk about getting engaged and married a lot (we've been together 6+ years). But after many discussions about our values, future dreams, etc. I know he isn't going to propose until I have a job that he thinks is good enough. It makes me feel awful and like I'm not enough because I can't get a job that will pay \"even $15/hr full time with benefits?\" like he asks why I can't get. \n\nI don't fucking know why people won't hire me or why jobs aren't paying $15 or more for my career field other than the pandemic and the fact I only have a year of \"qualifying experience\" (I worked in a related field for 2 years through college did multiple internships, and keep getting told I have no experience).\n\nIt's not like I think about killing myself as brutally as I used to in highschool, when I actually attempted once and started cutting. It's become this dull feeling of being stuck and just wanting to not exist or wanting to be dead and wanting all of the pain and anxiety to go away. \n\nI really realized I had a problem when on my one off day I decided to go into the theme park and ride rides but had a way different reaction. I used to be super scared and super excited for things like that, but every ride I went on made me just feel meh. Like I didn't care even if it killed me. I got no excitement out of it which made me feel even worse.\n\nI know what I want, but I don't know why everything has to be so hard. I WANT to marry my boyfriend, I WANT a decent job with benefits and decent pay where I'm respected, I WANT a family that loves and cares about me and supports me. \n\nIt's not even like I'm being lazy or expecting this to all be handed to me; I'm going to work every day even though it makes me want to drive into a tree and I'm applying to jobs even though next to none have responded or interviewed me (shout-out to the one that I did a four hour panel interview for that straight up ghosted me afterward) even when I am EXHAUSTED and done with life. \n\nI think about dying almost every day and how much simpler it might be. I cry all the time, ESPECIALLY when someone is kind to me. I cried the other day because a fast food worker gave me a 10% discount on my meal. I had to excuse myself to go to the restroom and cry after a guest at the park called me pretty. I cried on the way home from work the past three nights just because I felt so tired and sad. \n\nI don't feel like I have any time to accomplish anything at home - especially taking care of myself in ways like cleaning my room (it's a wreck), putting my furniture from college back together (it's sat there half finished for 4 months), or even just watching a movie/TV show. It's this constant cycle of working and being exhausted so I try and rest (get insomnia and can't sleep so I'm not well rested) then sleeping in when I should be productive because I'm trying to recharge, rushing to work, getting home and not having time to do anything except get ready for the next work day.\n\nI fucking hate this.", "title": "Feeling lost and ranting"}, {"created_utc": 1627878860, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ow7hxs/there_is_only_guilt_and_sadness_here/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "I can\u2019t escape guilt.

My expectation was that I would not be referred for hospitalization unless I was in imminent danger (ie with a plan and intent and means), if I was going to hurt someone else, or if I was incompetent/unable to make decisions for myself. I was told that I would be asked clarifying assessment questions, and a phone call or video session could be scheduled before going the hospitalization route. There were plenty of other choices. If reasonable steps had been taken prior to calling the clinic, I wouldn\u2019t have felt so awful. Instead, the choice was made to give me an hour to make arrangements with work, try to take care of my own needs, and cancel my plans for the day. Sudden emergency treatment for a thought that wasn\u2019t even current did not, and does not make sense to me. I tried to explain that I had no plan, no intent, no means, but I was just met with \"I still want you to be evaluated.\"  \nIn therapy, I've ben working through trauma. This evaluation situation led to a loss of control. It had consequences that have affected my work, my family, and my agency. The person evaluating me seemed pretty ready to send me home since I wasn\u2019t in crisis, but then they called my therapist and suddenly things were different. I now had strangers calling my closest family member and painting me as a person who can\u2019t be trusted. I felt like my voice did not matter, and I was powerless to do anything about my situation. All I could do is put my head down and be compliant so something worse doesn\u2019t happen. This sounds a lot like more trauma to me.   \nI don\u2019t know what my therapist's plans are to try to repair this, but my expectation is that it is my therapist who leads because it was her choice to break confidentiality when I wasn\u2019t in crisis. She knew that this exact situation was a fear I\u2019ve communicated to her since the beginning-me saying the wrong thing and setting off a chain of events where I lose control of what happens to me. To me, it seems like this was purely a \u201ccover your ass\u201d move because the decision was based on other clients she's seen, and not me.

My therapist messaged to see how I was doing, and I let her know that I was stewing in all of this. She arranged a session so we could talk about it, which I appreciated through my anger. She said that she didn't want to retraumatize me. And she let me decide when to I could go home (after checking with my family member to see if I was showing any reason that I couldn't go home-duh, I wasn't). She was unhappy with how I was treated at the clinic. \n\n  \nI'm not sure where to go from here. I think my therapist is trying to repair things by seeing me on a Saturday, allowing me more agency in deciding when to go home, and apologizing for not taking the time to talk me through what was happening before sending me to the clinic. However, it is now my goal to make sure this never, ever happens again. I hope that if my therapist wants me to be around people, she can just send me to my family member's house without the clinic step. I am trying so hard to suppress any suicidal thoughts that come up. It's kinda like whack a mole. I try to distract as hard as I can.   \n\n\nI'm also afraid to go home now, because it's now the place where I was told I needed to get evaluated, last time I was there I was packing things up and prepping my cat's stuff so she'd be okay for 4 days. I was doing this against my will, I didn't have control over my life. It reminds me of what happened to me when my brain is trying hard to forget because it is traumatic to suddenly lose control over your circumstances. I was in survival mode and I'm just now trying to process it since I'm \"free\" now. Oh yeah, and my place is a depression pit. I already took the  next 2 days off from work because I thought I was going to have to be supervised. I could work, I don't want to, so I think I'm going to take my days. If I'm being evaluated at a clinic, hopefully that makes me \"sick enough\" to justify those days.   \n\n\nI don't know why I'm writing. To get it off my chest, I guess? To see if this has happened to anyone else? I don't want to die, I know that. I want life to be different, to be better. I want society to be better. I want a life that's not controlled by capitalism. But that's not going to happen, so my brain is trying to find ways out. Life is all I know. Death is nothingness and that's not what I'm going for. But hey, send me for evaluation because I'm totally in danger! /s  The whole thing is and was just ridiculous. Maybe I'm looking for someone to agree with how ridiculous the whole situation was?

Thank you to anyone who reads this.\n\nI was voluntold to go to inpatient for a psych hold a few months ago. It was a good destressor and helped me reset, but it wasn\u2019t the cure, obviously. I was told there to look into BPD when I left as a best first guess. Today I would say it\u2019s some tossup between cptsd, autism and adhd. After inpatient i took months of therapy in DBT and IFST and recently had to stop because of insurance woes. Therapy didn\u2019t work for me anyways because I mask to my therapists. I also followed the advice of \u201cbuild a life worth living\u201d and have tried but social interaction is really overwhelming for me and I need intimate human contact to be real and not depersonalized. Other activities to fill my time are just \u201cthings that may squeeze out a dopamine drop if i try.\u201d The only solitary activity I enjoy is walking around town and I mostly daydream about things I\u2019d talk about if I had people I could talk to.\n\nI am \u201chigh functioning\u201d and keep all my problems in. I think most people perceive me as odd and quiet but certainly not \u201cin constant emotional turmoil\u201d. I perceive the world around me as not being real and just feeling like I\u2019m watching myself act out a play. I am both not in control and nothing actually matters. When I am alone and I don\u2019t have to mask it all comes out. It is such an overwhelming sorrow and pain that I convulsion, thrash and vocalize just to have an outlet for the feeling. I want nothing more than to be freed of these breakdowns. I have never shown myself in that state to anyone or even acknowledged it exists to others until now. I have always just told myself it didn\u2019t count because only I experienced it. Same reason I have never told my therapists.  My breakdowns are over feeling unlovable and like I am going to suffer alone until I give up and finish this play, and over perceived social faux pas from my attempts to socialize and somehow put myself out there without burning myself to ash on other people. \n\nBack in March I made a lot of life changes and it gave me a boost to keep pushing on, but some have fallen short and others are \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fif they actually pay off, and I\u2019m running out of gas either holding off the breakdowns or letting them consume me.

To me this meant I had to be happy for everyone in my immediate family and whenever I was said I was just left alone to sort it out myself. This caused me to not be able to display or vent how I felt to others including friends and other family members. Finally when I started to open up online to people who wouldn\u2019t know who I was I was always told the same thing \u201cit\u2019ll get better\u201d \u201csomeone out there cares for you\u201d \u201cyou just got to put the effort in\u201d etc. So that\u2019s what I decided to do. The first attempt of me trying to turn my life around was going to therapy in middle school. This turned out bad because I didn\u2019t actually trust my therapist and she knew my ex (that I just had a break up with at the time) and would talk about him constantly saying of how good of a person he is etc. so I got a inaccurate diagnosis and people at my school found out and bullied me causing me to go to many different schools all the way up till high school. The second time I was involving myself in after school activities, I was in so many different clubs and my mom was actually happy for me, this backfired because she was so \u2018happy for me\u2019 to the point when I was old enough to get a job she told me not to and just focus on my clubs/sports and when I graduated and finally went to go look for a job all the places I went to rejected me because for a starting position they could find someone younger, more energetic, and can pay them less. I finally stopped looking for a job and decided to go to university instead and hopefully get on a good path again. My mom again, was happy for me, and my first semester was good but things took a turn for my second semester. I told my mom I wanted to drop out but she forced me to keep going. It wasn\u2019t till the third semester when the uni kicked me out she finally agreed to let me not go back. This however made her angry and disappointed in me and she told me to pay her back for the two semesters I failed (even though I didn\u2019t even want to take those classes) and ontop of that I\u2019m right where I started but now with student debt. After a while I finally found a job and it was going good till they moved me to a different department, there\u2019s no ac in the building and I\u2019m doing heavy lifting, so ontop of me on 3 different occasions of almost getting heatstroke (one of the days reached up to 129\u00b0F) and getting called in for two days (4hrs a day) bi weekly, I thought it was right to quit. I got a job offer available for me so I decided to quit my job, when I went to go submit my official resume turned out I needed my ssid which my mom lost. So I had to pay $90 to get one. Now I\u2019m without a job again with student debt out $90 because of my mom and have a high chance of someone stealing all my information as a human (had to ship my birth certificate and passport to get a new one along with a paper with my ssid on it) and all of the days for me are basically the same. I have no friends anymore because I went to uni and none of my uni friends talk to me anymore along with my emotions being repressed horribly now that I genuinely don\u2019t even know how I feel anymore and the worst part of this all is that it doesn\u2019t get better and all of this could\u2019ve been avoided.

I\u2019m already 19 years old and I still don\u2019t even have a job yet which is truly sad and pathetic. My own parents are actually trying to threaten me that if I don\u2019t get a job, they\u2019ll kick me out of the house right after I graduate high school. I have 1 year left to graduate. I honestly don\u2019t care what my parents will do anymore, I just want them to kick me out so I can end my own life. I never really cared about myself nor wanted to live. I don\u2019t have the guts to kill myself now so I\u2019m just waiting patiently for my parents to help me end my pain. I\u2019m planning to just end my own life right after I graduate. Chronic procrastination has affected my life in so many ways. It\u2019s affected my physical health, my hygiene, my relationship with my family, my school grades, and my mental health. I\u2019ve struggled with chronic procrastination ever since I was in Elementary School. I didn\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong with me in the past but based on my own research, I\u2019m now 100% sure that I\u2019m struggling with chronic procrastination. ADHD is the reason why I struggle with chronic procrastination. Chronic procrastination has pretty much took away my happiness and gave me nothing but self hatred. I hate myself and I hate the way I am today. I truly want to change all of my bad habits, but it\u2019s just too difficult. I can\u2019t even do something as simple as brushing my teeth everyday which again, just shows how pathetic I am and how much of a mistake I am. I\u2019ve tried to change my bad habits in the past but like a drug addict, I eventually relapsed back to my old bad habits. Trying to change my bad habits feels like asking a person with smoking addiction to stop smoking completely which is why it\u2019s very difficult for me to change. The fact that I can\u2019t change my bad habits no matter how hard I try, makes me feel like maybe I should just end my own life so I won\u2019t end up disappointing my family. Maybe I\u2019m just born to fail on life and never succeed. I no longer see confidence in myself and I don\u2019t see any point of trying anymore. So nowadays, I just let chronic procrastination destroy my life. My everyday life is pretty much playing mobile games all day and sitting on the couch. I honestly can\u2019t stand doing the same thing everyday, but I know that even if I tried changing, I\u2019m just going to fail anyway. My weight is increasing every month due to lack of exercise but I really don\u2019t care because I\u2019m just hoping a heart attack will kill me. My dental health isn\u2019t looking good either but again, I really don\u2019t care. All I\u2019m doing today, is just waiting for my death and thinking about what I should do now before I end it all next year. I wish I could just sleep forever so I can escape this reality but I know that\u2019s not possible. This year has been difficult for me, sometimes I cry in the night because of the amount of pain I\u2019m going through. I\u2019m tired of pretending that I\u2019m ok in front of my parents. They really have no idea how much pain I\u2019m going through nor how long I\u2019ve suffered with this pain. The more we argue and the more they yell at me, the worse I feel about myself. The more I think about my past memories, the more I hate myself. Playing mobile games all day is more of a coping mechanism to me because it helps me escape reality and it helps me distract my brain from the pain. Everyday I act as if nothing is wrong with me but I\u2019m just hiding it really well. I\u2019m hiding my emotions through distractions. I deserve everything that\u2019s happening to me and I do hope I get COVID a 2nd time and hopefully end me this time.

I feel like I\u2019ll never amount to anything and that my life is as meaningless as used toilet paper. I spent everyday for years lying to people and only caring about myself. I spent so much time only wanting to foresee my delve into greed. I used a lot of people and hurt them. I spent most of my childhood being alone. I never had many friends if any. I never had sleepovers or went to parties. I never was social and I was always seen as the weird quiet kid. I was a victim of intermediate bullying all through my school years. Whether it was because my hair or the clothes I wore, kids always found a way to make me feel weaker than them. After I graduated high school, I went down a route of manipulating people to get what I want and feel better then they were. I hate me for doing those things. \n\nI feel so alone every day. I feel like I have no purpose in life and I have no one to turn to. Everyday I just feel nothing but a wave of angry and sadness and it follows me wherever I go. No matter how much I bury myself in video games, YouTube, creative writing or music, I just feel blocked and empty. The only person that I have in my life who can understand me is my dad because he suffers from PTSD but our relationship as father and son is so broken and doesn\u2019t seem real. We are more like roommates than we are father and son. He only talks to me when he needs something. Growing up, he was never really there for me and I remember some nights I would go hungry because he was more interested in spending money on cigarettes than food. Ever since he got fired in 2018, he just seemed to have lost his purpose and I feel like I\u2019m more of his father than he is mine and that hurts me. I\u2019ve tried to tell him this and he acts like he\u2019ll get it together with himself but he never does and that breaks my heart. \n\nI have like two people I can actually call my friend but I never really get to talk to them much because they\u2019re both very busy. One of them is my girlfriend that I love dearly but my overthinking gets in the way so much. I feel like I can\u2019t be good enough and I have really bad attachment issues so I suffer whenever she isn\u2019t around. I spent 4 years of my life(2016-2020) on 2 different people that emotionally and mentally destroyed me. I\u2019m so sick and tired of being me. I\u2019m so tired of waking every fucking day knowing I\u2019m stuck like this. Being an angry, sad and depressed wreck that can\u2019t better himself. I\u2019ve tried therapy, antidepressants, trying new things and taking better care of myself but no matter what I do, I always turn around and feel like death is the better option. \n\nI\u2019m just so done with being tired of overthinking constantly and feeling like I can never achieve anything. I\u2019m tired of being overly dependent on people that are hardly ever here for me. I\u2019m tired of feeling like I can\u2019t forgive myself for my ugly past and that I don\u2019t deserve anything but bad things. I feel like the only reason I\u2019m not dead yet is because of my shitty job at Walmart. I get so fucking close everyday to killing myself but I never find the way to put together the plan to do it. I just want it all to stop. I want to stop worrying and being scared of everything.

I needed help and desperately tried reaching out to my close friends, but they will rarely speak to me now.

It's somewhat understandable, but I have no one here. I'm living in my parent's house, alone, while they fucked off to the north for vacation. I'm spending six weeks in complete isolation while I do my job through Doordash. I've taken to alcohol, drink 2 or 3 Four Locos per night, finish off any empty cans when I wake up. I'm a mess, and when I ask for help, my friend have responded with silence. I get a response once a day if I'm lucky, and it's always some half-hearted ironic \"oof\" or \"same.\"\n\nI know they would regret that response if I were to unalive myself, which is disturbingly what I secretly wish. Them to be wrapped in pain and regret for not being there when I needed them most. I know it's sickening, and I hate myself even more for thinking it. But I long to be mourned, even though I'll never live to see those reactions. I only want to live in the memories of loved ones, because physically living is just... hell.

I barely passed high school. Beside that I was always mocked in school. I don\u2019t recall having one friend. I remember being always nice to people, but somehow, they found me boring. One time I managed to get invited to a new years eve party. When I showed up at the location agreed, nobody was there. I later found out, that they tricked me for fun in to showing up despite they dont want to hang out with me. This is one example of dozens being mocked by my peers.\n\nHowever, I managed to survive school without friends and started motivated into my twenties. I worked my ass off to save up money for college, since its basically impossible to get a \u201cgood\u201d job without a college degree where I live. At 25 I had saved up enough money to finance this. Like in school I could not manage to write good enough exams to stay in college. Within four/five years I failed twice my classes, which led to dropping out of college after five years, since I could not finance it anymore. The only job I could find now, was a minimum wage position. I am doing over hours as a cashier at a fast food chain to make ends meet. This situation drives me insane. I worked many years to save for college to just lost all money I had \u2013 and get nothing back in return. \n\nBesides that and never having many friends, I never experienced the slightest amount of romantical intimacy. Because of that I suffer from a terrific lack in this basic need. The worst thing about this, is knowing that the reason for my chronical rejection. I am just that unattractive. Why: I have basically tried everything to make a date happen over the last decade. I signed up on multiple dating sites, I asked out women directly, I joined single meetups. Nothing worked. Almost every women rejected me. That a woman once showed interest in me, never happened. Like every lack in a need, this lack starts to affect my mental resp. physical health negatively. The longer I have been rejected the more I suffered from symptom of this involuntary celibacy. I suffer from panic attacks, insomnia, depression and so on.\n\nAnd I know these symptoms occur because of this situation because whenever I made a small progress in this need like having a date or being touched in this context by a woman, these symptoms disappeared. Beside the obvious things like sex, kisses or relationships, I miss out all the social encounters within dating, since I am already getting cut off for a date. I never talk to a women, I never get messaged, I can never message a women. \n\nHere I am. With nothing and nobody. Poor. Sick. Every women rejects me. I don\u2019t know how I should continue living this life without anything of these things. I am going insane. I am basically the man no women wants. How can I accept that? People complained about not being able to date during covid. I am living this Nightmare for 31 years.

It's just something I feel I cant escape. I've have had several suicide attempts. Things I'm about to say are things I havent been able to talk about with fear of being locked away in a hospital again. My first time I tried, me and my family lived in a house outside of a small town. We had a barn where the rafters that hung just high enough to hang myself. My parents were at my one older brothers basketball game for high school. So only me and my little brother were home. While my little brother was distracted watching TV i went out to the barn and made a knose out of one our trading ropes we had for the horses. Once I made sure it was secure. I used a dog kendal to stand on. At first I hung there with the kennel right next to me. At first feeling the rope strangling me. It hurt so i stopped. Went inside and threw some of my dad's whiskey in some coffee so my little brother didnt know i was drinking. My little came in the kitchen not sure if he was staring at me or not i was focusing and preparing myself. I went back out to the barn. But this time. I kicked the kennel from me. So the rope tightend quickly. My brother my of known something was up cause next thing I knew he was trying to hold me up to keep the rope from chocking me. When I realized what was going on I could see him crying talking but I couldn't hear what he was saying but I could see the fear in his eyes. He moved the kennel back over trying to get me to stand on it. I evently gave and got down. I was 16 at the time. My little brother was 13. For awhile I was angry with him for not letting me die.\nThe next time I was 18 and just moved into my own place. My older brother and some friends had been drinking we decided to go for a drive. My brother let me drive my car. So as I sat in my backseat. We were on the Interstate. And I spontaneously opened the car door and let go. At the same time my best friend. Who has been passed away for 11 years now. Grabbed me by pants and pulled me back in. An closed the door. My brother pulled over as quickly as possible they tried my hands behind my back and strapped me in so I couldn't grab anything. My brother to my knowledge didnt tell anyone in our family. \nThe next time I had moved to another state on an impulse. I went and lived with a friend and his parents that used to go to school with. I was heavily doin pills, drinking, smoking. To trying to mumble myself for everything I felt. I was living in bedroom with a couple gals at the time. People that I would do pills with. One night they had left to go get some pot. While they were gone. I had handful of pills a combination of pain killers, narcotic pysch pills and methadone. I took them all and washed it down with a six pack. I dont remember much after. Next thing I knew I woke up in a mental hospital and was confused. Later I found out the people I was with acting strange and started having seizure. They got me in a car and drove me to hospital. At first I fought them about goin in the ER. The nurses came and between them all. They were able to get ne strapped to a gurny. They pumped my stomach and forced charcoal in my mouth. Quickly after that I went in to cardiac arrest. They had to shock me twice to get my heart working. At the same my oldest brother and his lived in the town I was in. They sat with all night and watched get shocked when my heart stopped. I tried again. 3 days after being released from the hospital. I was then finally diagnosed with type 2 bipolar.\nMy next attempted I had just been barely 19. Was under temporary supervision of my parents. I found my moms 38 pistol. I sat in basement with one bullet I loaded it and spun the chamber. As I was playing Russian roulette with myself my my second click my brother saw me and and hurried to taked the gun from me.\nNext time I just been discharged from the military because of my illnesses. Once agai. I was back living with my parents. I went into garage and attempted the off myself with the exhaust from the car. I did it wrong my mom noticed that was in there pull me out of the car and turned it off. I was so angry that inside and grabbed my dad's 350-7. But had put trigger locks on all the guns I was angry at my mom. I was shoving her out of the way. Was goin for a knife ro stab myself in the throat. Little did I know my mom had gotten hold of the deputy. So while I was fighting my mom. They came inside and put me on the floor and handcuffed me. I was then committed to the state hospital. I was there for only 6 months because I had no insurance they released me. That was my last attempt that was 10 years ago. I got myself hanging out with a gang just hoping I could get someone angry enough with me that they would kill me. I'm currently back on meds and seeing therapist now. But I dont feel that anything. And now I feel I'm tittering on the edge again. \nMy only thought about it all is people say committing suicide is a selfish act. But how I look at it those who keep from dying are the ones that are selfish for letting me get rid off my misery and my sad excuse of a life. I feel I'm being nothing of a coward cause I just keeping thinking of my daughter who's is 8 years old now. And I've only meet twice. First when she was born and before she turned three. I've constantly tried to be apart of her life. But her mother has continued  to evade me. So I dont know where shes at. It was all because I expected  to work so we could her the best possible life that I never had. So she left 2 weeks after we found out she was pregnant. I was only able to her the day she was born because someone told me she was in labor and what hospital she was at. \n When I got there she had gotten moved to a different room than what I was told she was in. I was made to wait in the waiting room until they brought my daughter to the nursery. I wasn't allowed to go in the room. I brought a duffle bag of clothes, diapers, wipes, toys and baby formula. \nWhen I went outside was so angry ad sad. My mother was with me. She watched me dent my car and punched my driver side window out. I dont know if I'll ever be able to be apart of my daughters life. But yet I've been hesitant of offing myself. But I'm again at the point that I don't feel like I'll ever with her. So I feel the best would be for me to die so she can receive SSI for me being dead because o dont feel the child support is enough.

It\u2019ll be hard to explain but if someone does read this thank you and sorry that I can\u2019t right good right now I\u2019m not in the right mind to be writing. \nI\u2019m not sure where to start honestly, I\u2019ll try my best,  as I wrote I just turned 16 this may, with that I feel like I\u2019m to young to even be having these feelings, my whole life I\u2019ve been more mature for my age in a way, I quickly wanted to become grown and stopped being a child in my head and I disassociated my activities from childish things in my eyes, I began to grasp at a early age what life was and the struggles of it, but although I understood what it was I didn\u2019t understand the hardship that people went through with that. I learned early about it to, ive been on the larger side my whole life and I\u2019ve always been insecure of my body and how other people view me even as a child I worried when it came to swimming classes, I would always go out arms crossed bent over saying it was \u201ccold\u201d as to hide my stomach, my parents would always joke around about my weight and recently I decided I wanted to begin losing it, but I\u2019ve tried the normal way and i wasn\u2019t getting the results I wanted so I\u2019ve been starving in intervals, back to it, the jokes would really get to me and the comments as well, I\u2019m soft to put it into small words, And this was almost the beginning of my \u201cissues\u201d that I ve been experiencing. As I said I\u2019m big, in weight and height a little, I\u2019m currently 6ft and 246-247 pounds, the highest I weighed was 269 and I\u2019ve gone down a size to which kinda made me happy,  but as I said I\u2019m big, and it\u2019s almost like I feel like I\u2019m expected to be this hard guy, I\u2019m mature, large, straight faced dude and I\u2019m never gonna cry or have my feelings hurt type thing, but it\u2019s not true at all, I fake all of it, i constantly cry and want to die over comments I get during the day and other things, I\u2019m always viewed as a pillar almost, I\u2019m always there for my friends and  have helped them through a lot , but me, no I can\u2019t show them I have problems, they\u2019re issues out weigh mine why should the help me. I also been talking to this girl, u could say childhood friends, we are both into each other and I really think I love her, but I always feel like I can\u2019t get to comfortable or else she\u2019ll leave as it\u2019s happened in the past with others, she a,ways tells me she\u2019s there for me but I can\u2019t help but not believe her and it hurts that I can\u2019t because she trust me and tells me things that hurt her and idk it hurts to not be able to tell anyone, I tell her I have friends so she doesn\u2019t have to worry when she\u2019s busy, but to be honest  I don\u2019t really have anyone other than her I can talk to, so I\u2019m scared to lose her. I want to say everything in my head as it pops up but it\u2019s hard, my family is religious and I was born into it and was really into it as a kid but slowly backed off it internally, it hurts since morally I feel disgusted, I was raised in it so leaving it slowly and spiritually I feel like I\u2019m going against my self , but I can\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t uphold those morals the harder I try I can\u2019t, my sister and brother both couldn\u2019t either and got\u201d punished\u201d almost by it religiously, when someone does something against the main rules and thought of it and it\u2019s found out they are almost disowned but not, and there\u2019s different tiers to this but my brother and sister both went through it but did come back into it later, and even I did but the lowest of it or least harsh since I was 13 at the time, but since they couldn\u2019t do what they set out to do I almost feel like I have to complete what they couldn\u2019t, and constantly being told I won\u2019t make it with my attitude or my interest makes me feel worthless, and I can\u2019t tell my parents that,they\u2019re probably dealing with more than that plus me, I feel like I\u2019m burdening them with my existence, they always blame my game for how I act or phone , they think it\u2019s my cousin and the , manga I buy or games I play are why I\u2019m like this and my whole life had dealt with it by taking it away from me as punishment, I do play with my cousin sometimes but I say I\u2019m playing with them as a cover when I talk to the girl i mentioned, I don\u2019t want them to know since I don\u2019t want them to blow it out of proportion, . Being told that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m like this even though it\u2019s a lie and I don\u2019t play with him kinda hurts, it\u2019s like I\u2019m like this because, idk but I can\u2019t tell them that. Or anything for that reason, if I try to explain this to them they\u2019ll probably take my game or phone or anything really and use it as and excuse for it. Actually I decided to write this because it happened, my parents can\u2019t believe I like reading manga and think someon implemented the thought of buying them into me and they think I get them to get good st the game, I explained today that I had been reading online for a while and now that I cleared that, while  explaining what my hero academia was I said it was a different world where people have powers and she says that\u2019s where your head is in that other world of crap and video games, and it\u2019s like omg I can\u2019t sometimes, I can\u2019t explain it, this happened because I ordered some manga online, total of all orders probably 25 ish dollars, and from this and me buying clothes at the store because I went down a size she decided to bend my card in half and say it\u2019s stolen now u couldn\u2019t listen to us now you can\u2019t use it, I have over 1,000 from me working and I can\u2019t purchase what I want even 25$ of it on stuff I like? There\u2019s s much more that really all in all stack together and I want to die, I can\u2019t handle it anymore, would it matter if I did, no, less money for my parents to spend and they don\u2019t have to worry about me anymore, maybe I\u2019ll be sad I can\u2019t talk to the girl again but she\u2019ll find someone better I bet that. And someone else is better I mean who tf wants to deal with me and all this, \u201call this\u201d like I\u2019m struggling, fuck man people are fighting wars, sickness, poverty, wtf am I doing bitching around, idk I can\u2019t help it honestly, maybe I will just die, I\u2019ll be forgotten quickly, most people won\u2019t even know I did. Will I do it, probably not I\u2019m a bitch do I want to tho yes, maybe I\u2019ll take. Some random pills tomorrow and starve a couple days and see where I go from there.

And I get an email saying that I have an outstanding balance of $8,200 that needs to be paid off in a week or I'll be automatically dropped from all of my classes. \n\nInitially, I was TOLD that I could choose a payment plan and that would help me pay small chunks of the tuition until I could pay it all off in a semester.

The things I believe would make me happy in the long term seem unreachable after how much I've fucked around for the past around... 4 years. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying I can't be happy in the moment - if I'm playing or otherwise interacting with friends, or if I see some funny ass video, or whatever else, it's definitely enjoyable. The thing is, no matter what happens, it always feels like I'm almost tainted with discontent and sadness, like regardless of anything I do I'll always end up reverting to the negative feelings I have on the deepest level, and everything happy is just a temporary distraction from that. Also, sometimes those things that make me happy feel a little subdued. \n\nWhat's more, negative events seem to all have the same draining effect on me, where things from being criticized by a family member randomly to fucking tiny things like seeing some illogical/stupid social issue (like someone being an asshole for literally no reason, or people regurgitating news headlines like they're fact without even bothering to open the fucking article in any issue and blabbing about it like they're some fucking expert and helping society and everyone around them like why can't you realize you're a fucking idiot, sorry for the rant) pisses me off or makes me sad enough that I end up having no energy for the rest of the day, sometimes even carrying on to the next morning.\n\nAfter reflecting about it I feel like the main source of all of this is disappointment in myself, and a feeling that I've wasted my potential in life, and also a feeling that I've made a bunch of irreversible small but significant decisions that fucked a lot of everything over. \n\nBasically the basis of this is when I was younger I'd be able to breeze through homework and assignments and everything, and when I reached a certain point I'd need to study a little bit, but it still wouldn't be too hard - I'd just procrastinate and do everything in the last night. But then, entering IB in the last 2 years of high school, I realized I'd really have to grind to perform as well as I did before, and I swear to god I fucking couldn't. I don't know if I'm just retarded or something or if I'm just making excuses for being a lazy fucking piece of shit but I'd just never be able to get myself to do anything related to schoolwork. It wasn't like I was doing anything especially fun or interesting either, like partying or hanging out with the bros. I kind of just spent the last 2-3 years of HS in a slump scraping by trying to do stuff last second, sometimes only starting things/submitting things the literal last possible day it could be done, including late extensions. \n\nI remember one time I sat myself down to actually do my physics IA at 7pm, and ended up fucking sitting there awake staring at the document until 7am the next day, without falling asleep or writing a single fucking word. I just couldn't fucking do it I swear to god. And what was I even supposed to tell my teacher? After a 2 week suspension I just didn't do it at night even though I tried? What the fuck? I'd slap the shit out of myself. \n\n\\[I know all this has gotten extremely unorganized and rambly, sorry for this, it's kind of just what happens when I start letting loose communicating things, even when I'm talking\\]\n\nI ended up dragging myself with acceptable grades, but I've never shook the feeling that I could have done so much better. Also, imo realistically, I could have, since I was literally studying for tests starting from 4am on the test day. Anyways that might be besides the point. \n\nAround this time I also got dumped \\[like omega fucking friendzoned\\] by my ex, who I was seeing long-distance, which I guess helped me feel a lot more inadequate physically and emotionally and personality wise or whatever, mainly I think I just felt a lot more lonely after this. And I can't even really see a point in even trying to date some girl, even if they were fucking hot, I honestly just miss the intimacy and understanding and connection we had (since we'd known each other since middle school) and nothing else, and I haven't found anyone that really comes close to that.\n\nAfter this, I ended up going to an alright university, but ended up choosing the non-main campus because I received a scholarship there but now I regret it and can't transfer over because it just so happens that this year they're making the campuses a lot more isolated in what I chose to major in. Like what the fuck. And I don't even know where I'm going with this anymore, if you're still reading this my train of thought has kind of just derailed. This was meant to be a nice calm post about my thoughts on this, and now it's spiralled into what everything else I touch is, fucking unorganized. I guess I'll just list everything else I can remember:\n\n\\- no energy to do anything\n\n\\- no motivation to do work, but enough ambition that I feel terrible that I don't do work\n\n\\- disappointed I could have achieved so much more and squandered it all, and am currently still squandering it\n\n\\- always unfocused, can only work in bursts that come completely randomly, and can never just sit down and work like people (when I heard people just sit down and do things what the fuck. maybe I'm just lazy or what)\n\n\\- lonely relationship wise\n\n\\- destined to be mediocre (by my own standards) for life and am completely not satisfied with it\n\nif someone says something like 'you know some people aren't meant for \\_\\_\\_' or 'you need to lower your expectations' like that burnt out gifted kids video i swear to fucking god this is why i want to fucking kill myself by the way, and please odn't offer this kind of garbage fucking talk thinking it helps you fucking dickhead, it just makes me or anyone that feels like me feel like even more of a wasted, defective, inept, mediocre person.\n\nalso, i'm not trying to say i'm extremely gifted or anything, or even gifted at all, just that i've found no meaning in what i'm doing and i've lost things that make me happy in the long term and i feel like i've completely wasted what i could have been by just not doing things. \n\ni think that's it?yeah I give up. all i can think of for now. sorry the quality of this post just devolved. i don't know if it can really be helped. do i have fucking adhd or something? i dont want to be one of those self diagnosing kids but i read a symptoms list and it kind of jsut described my entire life. and nic e lmao that's a sentence that's been said a million times by self diagnosing kids.\n\nholy shit and one more thing people that are assholes and mope because 'omg nothing matters we're all going to die' and use it as an excuse ot treat people like shit fucking piss me off as well. did you fucking think about how nothing matters when you were the person you were before? no you fucking didn't, so why are you treating it like it's changing your life now. that piece of information literally has no bearing on anything you do , you're just a closeted asshole (not closeted as in like gay closeted, nothing against gay people, like closeted as in they were always an asshole on the inside ah fucking shit why am i still goi", "title": "Should I just kill myself?

One is my \"why my life sucks and I'm fucked\" argument and the other is my more practical reason that i feel most would empathize with. \n\nLets start with the Life Sucks reasons. For starters, i grew up with aspergers syndrome, which people incorrectly assume makes me a genius or automatically \"high functioning\". \n\nTruthfully, I'm only smart in subjects that interest me (obsessions, really) and I'm completely useles and stupid with everything else. Especially social skills. i constantly and i mean CONSTANTLY misunderstand people, fail to pick up on social cues (subtle or overt), accidentally offend or piss off people, ramble, avoid eye contact, stammer, repeat myself, or just plain disturb people. I'm awkward and visibly nervous. \n\nI'm also mentally ill...at least bipolar and probably schizoid but that wasn't diagnosed by a professional. I have intrusive thoughts, extre paranoia, irritability, clinical depression, and chemical dependence. Speaking of which...\n\nDrugs! I always wanted to escape and numb but that's not the only things that led me to addiction. I have a giant hole in me like a missing puzzle piece and i wanted something to complete me. And at 22 i found it...crystal meth. I'm not trying to glorify meth, but after my first 4 hits on the pipe i felt myself become complete. I was happy and hopeful and confident; everything was exciting and deeply interesting. As I exhaled my 4th hit i remember vividly the thought i had...\"It's over. I would sell my soul to stay high on meth every waking moment of my life...i was instantly addicted and didn't care because now i had smokeable happiness, and more importantly, a reason to live. \n\nFast forward years of extreme, unrepentant meth abuse, and by this point the meth isn't helping shit...its actively stripping away my sanity. I'm sluggish, fatigued, ten times as depressed as ever, I can't get an erection, can't control my temper, have nightmares but can't stop sleeping, and yet i still crave it because I miss that brief period of pure, beautiful happiness. I have been trying halfassedly to get clean for a while but I can't last longer than a month before I relapse.  Meth is my only real reason to live. \n\nHell, I'm high right now. Hence the rambling post. \n\nBetween the mental illnesses, aspergers, meth damage, and the fact that I've never had a job or really done anything \"grown up\" since high school...all prevent me from so so much. I cant get a job or I'll lose my SSDI check which I'd never be able to get back; I have been homeless on and off since i was 19 (I'm almost 30 now); I don't have any skills or interests or goals or anything outside my addiction. \n\nI have been single for almost 3 years but hate sex. My parents are dead and whole family blacksheeped me at age 10. Got one friend who isn't a drug dealer and he has his own shit to deal with. I can almost guarantee that my only options are either give someone half my check for rent in some shithole, or be homeless and on meth somewhere slowly becoming the screaming lunatic tweaker everyone avoids or abuses. Every day I struggle to choose between those two shitty options but I'm scared to make a decision. \n\nNot to mention I deal with the trauma from experiencing years of abuse in psych wards, several rapes and countless molestations, harsh weather and harsher people.\n\nNow for my practical suicidal feelings...\n\nI have a huge fear of getting a disease or injury that causes chronic pain, or a terminal disease that kills slow and cruel. I fear not being allowed opioids because of my drug problems (despite not liking opioids, and I've tried them all) and inevitably becoming a heroin addict (a far more miserable, unmanageable habit. I'd never be able to support my habit but I can't run out or I'll be in permanent agony.  \n\nIn that situation...i think suicide is the appropriate action. If I can guarantee that the rest of my life is permanent agony, heroin addiction, cancer, dementia, life in prison, or some other inarguably unbearable hell, then it doesn't matter if I want to kill myself or not...ill be basically obligated.  And if I can't acquire a shotgun by then I'll just shoot a jet black shot of heroin into my jugular vein and OD peacefully. I've died for 5.5 minutes on heroin once and I know exactly how dying on heroin feels...two seconds of consciousness then instant sleep then death in your sleep. I felt no pain or even the loss of air in my lungs...i was asleep before i started dying. \n\nThat's my personal reasons for suicidal feelings.
