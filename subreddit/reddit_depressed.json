Even tho he continued to call me stuff like \"my cute baby\" etc, it just felt like he was playing with my feelings. \n\nAfter a while he straight up dropped me out of nowhere, I felt BROKEN. Even more than I already was. So after a while, after I thought I was over him I messaged him and we got along together again. He considered me his best friend but things were different. He didn't give me as much affection as he used to and things just weren't like they used to be, it felt like he doesn't love me anymore.\n\nSomehow I caught feelings for him AGAIN and I can't deal with it. I feel like if I cant get him to be my boyfriend, I can't get him to be anything. Not a friend, nothing.\n\nPart of me wants to continue fighting but I guess that that's what it's like to be in love, but part of me wants to tell him everything, knowing il probably end up losing him forever. Even tho he has treated me so badly and made me even more confused than I should be already.\n\nI'm just so scared of losing him even tho I'm breaking every day I'm being \"friends\" with him.\n\nI want him so so badly and I want to fight for it, but I don't know if I should.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if this was a lot and it's probably all over the placed and badly explained but I just had to pour it all out.

My mental health has been at an all time low. I\u2019ve been speaking to several doctors about what\u2019s been going on. I\u2019m having manic episodes, temper tantrums, arguing with my loved ones, suicidal thoughts, neglecting my self care and I\u2019ve been isolating. I\u2019m not sure why or how I am like this. I was recently diagnosed with bi polar disorder and I\u2019m on a ton of medication now. I am also a recovering alcoholic. It\u2019s been about 2 years since I\u2019ve had a drink but now it\u2019s been 2 years coping with my depression and anxiety without the use of drugs or drinking.

Which were things I\u2019ve always done to help me stay more so or less positive. \n\nIs there anyone similar? Does anyone have advice?",

        "selftext": "This is going to be a long depressing rant so pls forgive me. \n\nFirstly, it's really difficult to express my situation my mind goes through every Morning. Becoming unemployed is one thing which might be considered a \"curse\" in one's life. I've been dealing with this \"Curse\" since 7-8 months now since the time I was asked to leave because of COVID impacting my company. I still don't have a job. Since these last 7-8 months, every morning I get up, I always get these sorts of thoughts like \"DO SO SOMETHING. GET A JOB REAL FAST. OTHERWISE YOU'RE SCREWED\". I've like Applied to like 150-200+ companies now and got responses only from about 4-5 companies. But still, no avail. \n\nNow, I believe that unemployment is one situation which can affect the mind of that person from multiple ways and worse as the time progresses fast. Weird hypothetical thoughts start into creation. \n\nFor eg. Questioning my own self esteem, self respect. I feel like that I'm just a trash especially when compared to my college/University mates who still have their job in their hands.  \n\nThen there's a huge problem with my mind thinking that my family is now sort of avoiding me. But I know that they've always supported me in this situation and are still quite patient with me. But even if they're like a bit upset at my situation, I can only empathize with their feelings since I'm the one who doesn't have a job yet!! I also feel like they're giving my younger sibling more importance/more support and I tend to get ignored.  Also I really feel guilty when I always think that they've already spent so much on my education!! Now the situation here is that my father has a business of his own. But I really don't want to work in that business because it doesn't suit me at all!! The field is completely different from what I do/studied. Never has he forced me to join him but (again my mind playing tricks with me here) I think that I'll have to join if I don't get anything soon. Already age is not helping my cause. I'm in my mind 20s. And the culture of our country is very much backwards. Hope you get what I'm trying to say here.\n\nI'm one person who likes to go to different areas, can't sit at one place only and would love to meet different people when given a chance. Which is making me difficult to just sit at home and doing some online courses to \"upgrade my skills\". \n\nEveryday I get up in the morning, it's a state of anxiety, depression, anger with myself which is taking a toll on my body now. I always dreamt to save money and go abroad but that dream is like getting out of my hands every passing day. Again mind playing games here, It's like my future is going to be nothing but a rut!!\n\nThx guys for going through my long rant if you did. Since I don't have any friends, colleagues to talk to, This sub is kind enough to give me a platform to rant about my feelings!!",

Just a warning before you read it. \n\n\nSo This weekend solidified how worthless I am compared to literally anyone else. Let's start from the top. My mom's birthday was this weekend the day before Valentine's day. Now I work 3rd shift and as if sleeping for almost her entire birthday wasn't an asshole move on it's own, everyone else gets her presents and what did i have? her daughter who loves her so much? All i got her was a card with some money so she could get herself something nice that she wanted. Imagine how disappointed she is in me. She says \"I'm not disappointed, I can always use this at my florida trip\" but still. My brother and step dad got her gifts, actual gifts. Me? A card and money. FUCKING CARD AND MONEY!!!!! So I wasted away 6 hours of her day because I worked over 8 hours the previous night and when I was awake I wasn't good enough. Ok sk Saturday was a bust but hey Sunday surely was better right? Valentine's day, got a great girlfriend and was spending the day with her. Wrong. I didn't have enough money to get anything really good for her, but i got her a teddy bear and a box of chocolates. She does so much for me. She gets me a Spider-Man plushie, a pillow to hug when she's not with me, a big bear, candy, a rose, a new blanket and for dinner got my favorite place, Pizza Hut, in the shape of a heart. Then she let's us watch the movie of my choice. Not anything for Valentine's day. Nope I chose Sonic the Hedgehog. FUCKING SONIC THE HEDGEHOG!!! How disappointed she must be in how we spent such a special day and how far she went for me and how little i was able to do. She stresses that having me is enough but look at how much the people in my life do for me compared to what I'm able to do. \n\nSo in summary, Life would be a million times better without me. I'm nothing but a mistake and a failure. And this weekend shows that with flying colors.",

I succeded in almost of all i wanted, but when that year start, it all shuttered. I met the girl of my dreams. She is 28, has a child and she said at first that is divorced. She was cheated and so on, she has a broken heart. I started to love her and promised to be with her no matter what. At first, after she lied She is divorced, in fact she just break up for a while...and she didnt know what to do. To give a chance to the husband for the child or be with me. She loved me back at the beggining, she needed love and affection...and it was hard just to met for some hours. We met a lot of times and we really are so comfortable with each other. After a few months, he moved Back with her husband to try The last time. In this months she cheated on me, and it hurted me so bac because i loved her. From the new year, she is decided that she wants to be free. But, in all this time, i put myself second and give my best for her, because i know that she deserve better, and will realize how happy is with me. She knows that, but she is broken and afraid of love. She moved in other country in september...and her husband also. But they dont love at all. She has a major debt, and the only way was to ask from him..and now they work there to pay the debt, and she cant divorce now, but she wants it badly. Anyway...after 6 months...from being away, and talking with me...she promised me that she cant wait to see me and kiss me and everything will be fine someday. When we met after 6 months, she was so cold and said that do not love me and doesnt feel to hug me and so on. \nRight there, she broke me so fucking hard. All that year was so hard for me, started depression, i lose weight 12 kg in 5 months, and every day was a torture to see her so far away and still divorce....and then...to hear that and to lie me that will hug me and..so on...i was breaked. Than, after a week here, to. See her child and met with me,  she went back to the other country and...she is missing me and she feels something for me...i dont know what...she doesnt want to live without me because she knows that i make her happy, but she cant be with me now...and its already a year and 2 months...its been so much time alone...and in this shitty situation. And the bad news is that it will take at least one year more...i just cant. She is cold because this is how she is and...i cant suffer anymore seeing her with other man, even if i know she doesnt love him at all. She broke me so hard and i fighted so long, i am tired and i lost hope, but i love her so much. My depression is so fucked up, and i dont recognize myself. I lost faith, power, will, i am tired of all, and i feel myself not good enough, stupid, ugly and so on. I isolated myself so much from anybody, dont eat, just drink and smoke, every day, my memories are crushing me, and i cry daily. I didnt cry till 23, almost at all, but from when i met her...i just cant stop suffer. I think of suicide so often, and nothing makes me happy. Even if i see a nice view or city...i feel empty, alone, and want to be in a dark place where to cry and drunk my heart from feeling anymore. I dont know what to do. I feel like an idiot. But my broken heart wants her...even if i know i am getting hurt like hell. I feel like an 17 years old with first love, but its not like that. I had a 5 years relationship....\nI am so broken inside and i want to stop. I will never be happy, and i lost hope. I just want to get used to be like that cuz, i will live sad forever...and i cant move over this..i just dont have power..i need somebody to lift me from the ground, which will never happen. I hope to die as fast as possibile. Every day its a terror, and i wish to give my life to someone who wants to enjoy it. IT HURTS SO BAD !",

I\u2019ve literally blew through and sold everything I had. I\u2019m new to the medical field and a middle aged male and this seemed like something I\u2019d like to do. I have paypal and Venmo if anyone wants to help. I just need some money basically to get on my feet. I start the job Monday. Sorry if I\u2019m annoying anyone by posting this but I\u2019m desperate. Thank you so much and if you can send help please send good vibes my way. I know a lot of people have it worse than me and I understand that, but I\u2019m down to my last option and desperate. I know there\u2019s a lot of good people in the world and I am thankful for them. Thanks.\n\nThe class has actually been postponed for a few days because we are supposed to get about 12 inches of snow tonight so the classes won\u2019t be until the middle of next week likely. But I\u2019m still broke and please if anyone can find it to help I\u2019d so much appreciate it. I hate to ask but I\u2019m down to my last option.",

I don't feel like talking at all. I know I am having these weird depressing phases and I want it to stop but I can't. I don't why my mind goes into such depressive states. \n\nI haven't gone to any therapy or so or talked about it with anyone except a close friend. But I felt like her response was very cold and not supportive and it made me sad too. I haven't talked about this with my parents, mostly because I don't know how to talk about it with them or I am afraid what their response will be as they are very dismissive of mental health (can't blame them, it is just the mentality of the people in the locality we live). \n\nCan anybody explain why my mind goes into these depressive phases?",

She is a depressed person, who can barely walk down a street, yet she works over 14 hours per day.. sometimes more. She starts at 2am, and when she gets home by 6pm or so she falls asleep on the sofa all night, until 11pm atleast, when she will then go to bed... because she doesnt want to waste her evening sleeping by going to bed early. I tell her that if she goes to bed earlier and gets an appopriate amount of sleep every night then atleast she will get a few hours in the evening rather than being passed out on the sofa from the moment she gets in.. but she doesnt care. She is adamant not to change her routine.\n\nShe smoked like 20+ per day. She has had emphysema and other chest problems. She has had 15 coxix operations and 2 spinal operations.. and as a result she takes the highest dose of Fentanyl the doctors can prescribe just to keep away the pain.. yet at the same time as having all these issues.. and knowing she is fully able and eligble to go on disability.. she refuses to..\n\nSince childhood ive had to witness it. Every day I hear her growing and moaning in pain yet to stubborn to help herself, no matter what I say. I dont know how many arguements weve had just over me telling her I want her to be healthier or atleast try.. but nothing changes.\n\nMy dad left when i was 14, and then my sister left at 16, because of the level of negativety... but i didnt leave. I fucked up, and I refuse to blame this on anyone else but I do feel that these things have contributed. I went down the road of using drugs and alcohol to ignore the negativity..and I still do. \n\nCountless times when I was younger I asked my dad to take me with him, I kept saying its living in this negative house and watching my mother slowly kill herself and still having her shout at me or say depressing things all the time that is the cause of my problems, but either he doesnt care or he doesnt believe that. I believe it.. but am I just copping out? I went to rehab years ago and the main thing I learned there, is that you have to get away from the triggers to your addictions.. the things that make you want to use.. and what has always made me wants to use is having my mum shout at me, or having to check her pulse when shes asleep on the sofa incase shes died.. or watching her in pain  everyday... But i have no escape from it. Because of the way things have panned out with my addictions, im always broke now. I am further away from being able to move out than ever.\n\nSo, today I tried showing my dad a drawing I made. I was quite proud of it.. and within 3 messages he made me feel like a failure, mentioning something related to me  not having a job.. and I replied by saying maybe we should take a break from talking because you clearly dont like me after everything thats happened in the last few years, and he agreed.\n\nIm sorry but he is my dad. I asked countless times as my life got worse and worse and my issues got worse and worse JUST for him to let me live with him.. I just wanted to live in a positive house, thats all ive wanted. Ive proven before that the only place I could stay sober was in rehab which wasnt nearly as negative at my house, or in his house on a random weekend.. and i know just cause he didnt let me doesnt mean its his fault.. but it should mean that he should still like me? he shouldnt be telling me he doesnt like me when he couldve helped with the most simple thing?",

The only reason I talked to my sister about it because I saw nothing was being done and that\u2019s what I thought would be a good first step. (My sister\u2019s 11 btw) my mom told me I had no right to be concerned with my sister because I did the same thing when I was her age. I couldn\u2019t take being blamed every single time and I went out of control and bit my hand really badly and threatened to hurt myself. (I\u2019m doing fine now) ( my mom had to hold me back) it was very impulsive and I was scared and disgusted by myself and I regretted it deeply afterward. I called my dad and he was furious with me and his tone seemed like he would disown me if I hurt my sister which I would never do. He proceeded to blame me for hitting a breaking point and saying I was making it about myself. Me and my mom made up eventually and I went to my primary care doctor afterward and found some places I could go to. This situation could have gone much worse but I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t.

I didn\u2019t even get a speech my Dad promised on the phone which I was scared of the whole day.

        "selftext": "So, I just finished writing this and noticed it was a bit long, but it would be really nice if you read the whole thing, because this is the first time I've told anyone about this, and it would really mean a lot to me if you would listen to me without judging:'(.\n\nYou see, I have Misophonia, which basically means that whenever I hear a particular sound, I get triggered and irritated, to say the least. Sometimes, It turns into fits of rage, but instead of hurting others, I internalize(not in a painfully physical way, just clenching my fists or pulling my hair out.). \n\n  \nThese sounds are usually different for different people, and my triggers are chewing and just any sound that comes from people while eating. Since I don't really have a meal with anyone excluding my family, I get triggered by their sounds at mealtime.\n\n  \nUsually the first thing that someone suffering from Misophonia is advised to do is to get away from the trigger, which in my case would mean avoiding people at mealtime, and eating alone. \n\n  \nI knew I had to come out and tell my family about this, so that the condition wouldn't get worse, and that I wouldn't lash out at my loving family.   \nBefore I told them, they realized I would usually get very irritated at dinner time. I would cover at least one ear with one hand so I could eat with the other hand, and sometimes I would just stop eating and cover my ears. I couldn't run away from the room, because that just didn't feel right.   \nWell, they noticed, and my dad made fun of me almost everyday. They would mock me and imitate me. \n\nOnce it got really serious, the entire family was mocking me, making faces and laughing among themselves and talking behind my back. I somehow decided that I would try to be mature about it(I was quite young, maybe 11 or 12), and told them that it was really irritating me, and mocking me was only making it worse. My mother got really pissed at me, and said, \"Remember, you make chewing sounds too\".\n\nI was really really hurt by it\ud83d\ude25. Misophonia triggers are selective, which means only certain sounds coming from certain people trigger me. But I tried my best to understand that it was unusual behavior for them to see. So I just acted normal(which in my case simply means I didn't speak a word), after which I cried myself to sleep. \n\nOne day, I decided to tell my mom. I didn't actually go and speak to her about it, at first, I WhatsApped her a video explaining Misophonia. She just laughed, and said it I was behaving strangely because I was a teenager(yes, a lot of people confuse an actual medical condition with teenage rants). \n\nNow, I was already pretty hurt by it, I just ran into my bedroom, wrung my head in my hands and sobbed silently. As if it couldn't get any worse, at dinner, my family **actively decided** to make me feel uncomfortable by CHEWING LOUDLY WITH THEIR MOUTHS WIDE OPEN\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude25. I could see the food in their mouth, and it was sending me into a real fight or flight mode. I could feel a punch coming up from my fists because this was just horrible. But no. I kept it in again, like I had done everyday for the past 2 years.   \nAnd things just got worse everyday. I would just feel so low, and my friends made fun of me for it. They took the word \"depression\" lightly, and made fun of me for being depressed. Some of them actively bullied me, calling me a **depressed skinny kid** who **couldn't throw a punch.** I was spiraling into depression and didn't know how to get out of it.   \nI have basically no friends with whom I can entrust this side of me. There was one person who knows, but we parted ways, mostly because of my own stupidity. So now, I literally have no one. My parents have made it double clear that they don't understand, so many of my so called \"friends\" beat me up, mocked me everyday in front of the whole class, and since some of them were high scorers in school, the teachers followed them, and made fun of me too. The only person I could ever trust with anything is now on her own path, and she can't be there for me anymore. I just have, no one, not a soul, who will listen to me and help me out without judging me and cutting ties with me. I'm just, on my own and, I'm not exactly coping up very well.\n\nI'm not sure what I need to do get out of this. I don't have anyone to talk to, and just talking about it here was so hard for me. I have big dreams that I want to see accomplished, a life that I want to live, and hearts I want to touch, people I want to help, but I'm not able to fix myself. I just, need help, but every option to receive it seems impossible. How can I expect professional help if my parents believe it's just a teenage phase? How can I talk to people about it if I've isolated myself from everyone? How can I expect trust, when everyone I surround myself with has bullied me and left me?",

She was very aggressive about taking next steps, so that with all the body image issues, mediocre jobs, ands just general stuff I didn\u2019t deal with, our relationship started to be weird.

I will wear the same clothes for days, be completely listless, have no energy, never leave my room, cry a lot, barely be able to talk or anything. I have su****al thoughts that make it hard to focus because they invade my brain so it\u2019s all I can think about for hours at a time. I haven\u2019t done any university work for a while because the quiet it takes to focus means my mind goes to that place and I spiral. My sleeping has also gotten really bad. My parents have asked if I\u2019m ok and I try and explain but they interrupt saying \u201cI know lockdown is hard\u201d (it\u2019s been going on for longer than that), \u201cI know that not seeing your friends has been hard\u201d, \u201ceveryone\u2019s struggling at the moment\u201d (which is true an i understand that and I feel guilty for feeling how I do when I realise how common it is - like I\u2019m being dramatic). \n\nThe saddest part is my sister has had clinical depression for years and been medicated for it. My parents have said it\u2019s their biggest regret they didn\u2019t help her enough. I\u2019m not comparing our experiences as she had a lot of trauma that I have not experienced, but it feels like they don\u2019t want to deal with more pain in the family so are shutting their eyes. (My dad has explicitly said he will not deal with a mentally unwell family member as he spent so long caring for his depressed mother, and that\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t there for my sister either). My mum is sympathetic but seems to think it\u2019s just me being a bit sad, not something completely ruining my life. I feel like if I say the word depressed she\u2019ll get defensive about her parenting and basically shush me like she did with my sister.  They\u2019re quite old fashioned and defensive with their kids even if sympathetic to mental health generally. \n\nMy boyfriend is amazing and tries but it\u2019s long distance atm due to covid. He has a lot going on in his life (way more than me) and I think he\u2019s becoming numb and shutting down like I have seen myself and others do in hard times. He listens to me but I can\u2019t shake the feeling he doesn\u2019t really believe me or have time for me because of all the turbulence in his own life. I feel guilty repeatedly trying to talk to him because he has it worse. \n\nSimilarly with my sister she has had a very traumatic life and it would feel ridiculous to talk to her about my own minor problems. \n\nMy best friend has been amazing but I don\u2019t want to lean on her entirely as I\u2019ve been the crutch before and it can be very draining. I also feel embarrassed about some of the gory details of what I\u2019m going through. \n\nBasically I don\u2019t know who to talk to, how to express the seriousness of my situation to my parents and get them to take it seriously without using the word depression which will make them shut down. I don\u2019t know if I can support my boyfriend at the moment when talking to him makes me feel more alone but I don\u2019t want to break up. I feel like I\u2019m falling apart or more like slowly fading away in front of everyone and everyone\u2019s either looking away or doesn\u2019t believe me. Sorry this was so long I\u2019d really appreciate advice. \n\n\nTL/DR: I think I might be depressed but am not sure. How do I get my parents to take me seriously without using the word depressed because that will make them shut down/ talk me out of it.",

So much lust, insecurities, worries,etc. We met each other by coincidence, and when I first saw her, I said DAMN. She was looking pretty good. And ever since that I have had a crush on her. The first weeks of stuff was going alright. We became to know each other a bit more and I started to hangout with her after school. I would go wherever she would go. But this wasn\u2019t a good thing. I noticed the more I would spend time with her, was the more she would back off from me. And Not to mention, but I had recently got her Snapchat also and she would text me everyday. Have little conversations n shit like that. I would post a lot of sad quotes to get her attention. Now I think is what made her lose interest in me. \n\nClose to 2 weeks Before Valentine\u2019s Day everything was cool. It\u2019s just my f*cking attention seeking problem that f*cked it up. Posting Sad Quotes everyday is not the way to and it just shows that u care way too much. She even asked \u201cWhy Do U Care So Much?\u201d Now me not wanting to tell her that it\u2019s because I really like her, I think I said something like \u201cwhen I really care about someone, I- blah- blah-blah-blah\u201d.

I feel like I have some feminine traits, which I don\u2019t like to have. Me posting Sad Quotes everyday like for what. I regret that shit so bad. Me caring too much, Not leading my own life, being a simp, etc. This time I F*cked Up but in a different way. I lost 2 people I could\u2019ve been friends with all because of my f*cking attention seeking problem. I don\u2019t know why. I attention seek for everything in different ways. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna get it to stop, but this shit has to stop. I lost someone that I\u2019m never gonna get back because of my attention seeking problem.

I had the reasons in my head but didn\u2019t want to take things with a grain of salt. eI hate my life and I\u2019m crying as I write this because she was one of a kind and I feel as if I would never find someone like her again.

I\u2019m not going to college because I\u2019m not smart enough I can barely spell (i\u2019m writing this with text to speak) but even if I was I\u2019d probably be too anxious to even go. I get anxious and freaked out trying to get a haircut I can\u2019t really talk to people. There\u2019s also things with my family that I can\u2019t control like the death of my grandma and my grandpa who\u2019s slowly drink himself to death. he was my father figure because my dad is a POS and my grandpa taught me everything I know and seeing him how he is now is just sad.

Most of the time people talk about things that I don't really care about and thus not able to weigh in. I used to have friends, but they left me in the dust and just stopped caring about me. This has obviously taken a toll on my mental health ever since 8th grade, to the point where I have thought about ending it multiple times. I used to have a deep crush on this girl I was friends with and that shared similar interests with me, and before our school closed down due to covid, I confessed to her, but she unsurprisingly turned me down. I knew it was going to happen since I was only fucking 14 at the time, but it still hurt. I know it doesn't really relate to the focus of this post, but at this point idc.\n\nAlso, on my birthday in 2019, my school took us to a field trip to a local science center/museum type place, and I was able to be in a group with my at the time friends, including the girl I liked, but they almost immediately abandoned me, which was all my fault. When I was away from them, they went over to talk, but I just pushed them away. So that was my fault. Anyways, when we got back to school, I immediately went to the counselor's office to bawl my eyes out. I blamed me being alone on them, which wasn't true, but it felt that way to me. That shows how pathetic I am.\n\nAnd now we reach today, where nobody cares about me and nobody wants to talk to me. Whenever I talk to someone, I'm the one starting the conversation, and then a little bit later they tune me out, leaving me talking to myself.\n\nI just don't know what to do at this point. And just saying to try my best won't work. I hate my life rn, and I hate high school. That is all.",

Besides my family, my wife has been the reason I try to keep going everyday or through the pain. My depression and pain has caused me to become mean and negative all the time and I hate it so much. I want to be happy and positive so fucking bad. \n\n I want to be the husband I know I could be without all this bullshit on the inside holding me down. Lately things have been going down hill more and more. My wife told me she doesn\u2019t ever want kids after we have been planning for three years to try and have one this coming September when she will be leaving the military. I didn\u2019t handle this well at all and that was wrong of me. I said some mean shit to her like called her a liar and that she just used me for years just to bullshit me among others shit I shouldn\u2019t have said like call her names. This hurt her badly and on top of this the next day she had to go underway for two weeks. When she got back she immediately went off on me and told me she hated me, that she was divorcing me and she hopes I fucking kill myself. She never wanted kids with me and she was just lying to herself. Well she stormed off and said she was moving out and would be back for her stuff. Come to find out she rented a room from some guy and was living with him for 3 days till I found out and this went over awfully. I said more shit I shouldn\u2019t have like called her a slut and what she was doing was trashy. She moved back home but then bought at motorcycle and tried to keep it secretly at this guys house. Which was out out of no where as she made me promise to never buy one cause she would worry so much about me. This went over badly between us. Honestly I spazzed out on her and told her to bring her fucking bike home or I would go over to that guys house and get it either way myself. She gets it home and now we have been having conflict over that stupid motorcycle ever since. \n\n I saw her phone there was picture of her and this guy n also pictures of her the first day she got her motorcycle and she was flipping off the camera. Idk why but it set me off and I delete the pictures from her phone and this really upset her. Unfortunately she went underway for three weeks again just a couple days after this. I tried to reach out and apologize and make amends about this but she only emailed me back that she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me at all this underway and how pissed off she was about me deleting the pictures n how I have been lately. That she wants to think of the underway as a break from me. I\u2019m pretty sure that she\u2019s not coming home when she gets back and if she does she\u2019s just gonna tell me how much she hates me and is going to divorce me. I don\u2019t how everything changed so fast but it sucks. I just want to go back to my normal. \n\n I just hope she knows how much I truly love her and I hope to see her again in another life. This hurts so bad to say and do. As I sit here in my garage freezing and crying with looking at pictures of her. I hope my actions tonight can bring her some peace finally. I\u2019m so sorry for the pain I have caused you Faith and I hope to make it a little better for you. I hope you can find some peace and happiness in this life. You will always be my sunshine and other half. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any going back now. This isn\u2019t a plea for pity or anything like that. I won\u2019t survive this I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to stand on a rolling stool with a noose around a I beam and just shoot myself in the head so I fall and strangle to death just incase the bullet doesn\u2019t kill me. \n\n Well this is already too long just like my life. I guess if these are my last words or thoughts I want to end it on this. Faith thank you for all the memories, good times and support while it lasted. I\u2019m sorry for any pain I have caused you.

Did you hear that blah uncles daughter is doing blah degree from BLAH university. You have to be more successful than them. Dont embarrass me in front of others\". We dont celebrate mini occasions with our family. Rich people throw a massive party and there is nothing like love. Theres just competition that who was wearing the most gorgeous dress and how was the food? \"Did you hear he had prawns too and deer meat?\" Rich parents think their children cant have problems cuz they have handed you some dollars to do whatever. They dont give you love, all they care about is success. Rich friends? They are absolutely fake. When it comes to birthdays, they would just go to some store and buy a very expensive gift for you. They would never put effort and love in it. Btw it sounds like i am a lot rich but the thing is our family likes to save and collect money more and doesnt spend needlessly on expensive things. Thats why we dont appear and look like rich but we look like normal people.

First i lost my friends (kinda) randomly they would make fun of me for just random stuff or when we would have a normal talk they would just say bad stuff about me for idk why.\n\n Then my family lost my trust in me and i lost my trust to them they would have any excuse to just yell at me and they took reasons like not moving my school bag cause i would trip and die (apparently :/) and for any actual good thing i did they didn't care at all.\n\nI also lost my consistency in school. I went from being a straight A student to straight D/F student (in our country we don't use FDCBA but we use 12345 1 being the worst) Teachers would judge me for anything even taking a rubber out of my bag while doing a math problem. Our teachers usually let the \"smarter students\" do the problems, reading, explinations (idk how to spell that), etc. but for some reason they still pick me the one person that's probably not gonna get it right. Also in school people just try to break me physically and psychologically i would even get beat up for nothing or just bullied while going home for being \"Me\"\n\nI thought my only chance left in life would be my gaming computer. Maybe become a pro or starts streaming but due to anxiety i never wanted to reveal my voice and my face, becoming a pro also didn't work out due to parents and school.\n\nLater i started to drink water much less eat much less shower much less etc. because i felt bad for other that i was wasting their needs.\n\nAnd the worst thing is it's my fault. It's my fault i study less. even though my parents are mad i could just do it. I could try to stand up for myself but i'm too insecure. And all of my problems just lead to me.\n\nI really don't know i just don't know what to do i'm scared to do anything in life and when i do there's always something wrong with myself and i can't be here anymore. I just cant. \n\nThis went on so badly that i got multiple anxiety attacks and one lead to being banned from a discord server because my mind was broken and all that was controlling it was my anxiety and depression which got me saying bad and random stuff about self harm and suicide. And so bad that i started writing self harm methods and dates into my notebook hoping to find the perfect one. I knew if everybody hates me i'm not gonna let somebody kill me. I had enough of it and i wanted to kill myself before they could kill me.\n\nSoon i might be gone. I'm just trying to just maybe get an answer and help even though i doubt it since nobody cares about me. \n\nI don't know what help i need, idk how to improve myself in games, idk how to even talk about it online so i'm sorry if i said something wrong, and i don't know how to become a person worth eating food, drinking water, washing myself and breathing oxygen from people who are worth living unlike me.",

        "selftext": "My first time in this sub and never thought I would have to post something here, but here I am. I, 19M come from a super conservative Muslim family and up until I passed through puberty which was around 13 to 15, I was accustomed to being under my strict dad, obeying him like a slave would do towards their master and what not, and felt content. Be that as it may, naturally pubertal related hormonal changes were terrific for me and I really started to feel isolated, and since I was homeschooled, I didn\u2019t get out to socialise through social clubs or interacting for adventurous activities and the likes which further complemented the pitfall I was falling into.\n\nNow, the banger comes in because of my dads\u2019 moral compass and his dominant attitude towards things he has extensive control over. In addition to having strong religious beliefs, both of his parents were educators with his father being a principal. Coupling all those factors, he has evolved to be a \u201cbulldozer with no cockpit\u201d, and it has stemmed to curate his domineering attitude through which he forces whatever he thinks as correct on me and my siblings. I would hear other kids experiences describing their parents as abusive and while I did not want to lay the term on my dad, I\u2019m afraid I do now. \n\nHe literally almost kicked me out twice, once when I was 11 I pissed him by lying about opening up a toys gift package one of his friends in another country had given over to him to pass it on to another friend and the other when I was 15 for lying to him that I completed my studies for the day when I had more to do and he figured it out when he came over for a spontaneous check. While I acknowledge that it was my fault for blatantly lying but the primary reason was because I knew he would scream into my eyes and give me a few whips with anything he found near him if I got on his nerves by not completing what I was supposed to finish, so I decide to lie and days when finds out, I would spend 15 minutes \u201cpooping\u201d in the toilet when I would balling my eyes out silently.\n\nThe first thought that most would get would be why am I even living with him when I surpassed the adult age, 18. You may be right but usually, in our country, we are not exactly accustomed to gain exhaustive independence simply when you  become an adult. Again, it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t move out, I can but I just finished a diploma and am planning on starting my degree commencing this fall and I rely on him for funding and education is not necessarily cheap.\n\nReason I wrote this today was because every time I saw him, I just felt like life would be a million times better if I had a dad whom I could say to at night \u201cI love you\u201d. Literally asked my mum tonight if he would be travelling anywhere (for business) because I just felt that jumping off my building would be a better way to die than bearing the negative brunt of his power. The only thing that is holding me back is the fact that I have a slight tinge of hope that one day I\u2019ll be able to fly wide and the fact that I would kill my mother\u2019s heart if I do so and I hate that because I love her so much. She has her own ways of handling things but would never force anything on me and I appreciate that a lot.\n\nI am so sorry I had to vent this out, but I want to cry so bad :(",

        "selftext": "Hi\n\nI wanted to get this off my chest as I haven\u2019t told anyone my story before. \n22 m.\nI live a well rounded life with good friends, supportive family, a part time job and I study full time. From the outside my life is essentially perfect, and I am extremely grateful for all of these things. \n\nFrom birth, Ive had really bad stomach problems, I\u2019ve seen several specialists (from age 3) due to me not eating enough food and becoming anorexic. My parents were always supportive but got very sad seeing me so skinny, it was a hard time growing up.\n\nThis developed into some really bad eating habits (or lack of eating) and has lead to an eating disorder which was diagnosed last year. I don\u2019t find enjoyment out of food at all, I don\u2019t feel happy when I eat due to it being quite uncomfortable. \nI avoid eating out with family and friends as I can\u2019t finish any meals and feel really embarrassed. \n\nI have a rare blood disease which has deteriorated some of my vital organs a lot, I take medication for everything now so it\u2019s all okay for the moment. \nI had to undergo quite a bit of chemo and heavy pharmaceutical drugs which weakened my bones and now I have osteoarthritis and a lot of joint / muscle pain. I\u2019m expected to get a bone infusion later this year. \n\nI am a naturally happy person, however my physical conditions have taken a really big toll on my mental health. I am quite depressed, have lots of suicidal ideation (and have attempted once), bad anxiety attacks and significant mood fluctuations. \n\nA few years ago I was prescribed benzodiazepines to help stabilise my anxiety. Long story short, really liked those drugs and became dependent on alprazolam, Valium and a few other ones (resulting in a few hospital stays sadly *a very dark period in my life*). \n\nI really struggle with sexual pleasure and achieving orgasm, due to the drug abuse and depression. There\u2019s been times when I haven\u2019t been able to get an erection with female company and it\u2019s quite embarrassing (but oh well not the worst thing in the world). \n\nFast forward to last year, I was admitted into a psych ward due to being on suicide watch and abusing drugs. I was self harming quite a bit and had some really bad coping mechanisms. TW: I used to cut the tips of my fingers quite a lot, it made everything feel \u2018real\u2019 when I was going through drug induced psychotic episodes. \n\nI am in a much better place health wise. \nI am clean off drugs and don\u2019t self harm regularly.\nI\u2019m certainly not doing a whole lot better but .. a lot healthier all things considered. \n\nI find life really hard. A lot harder than I know it should be. I have happy aspects, but internally I just don\u2019t feel right. I feel sick everyday, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a life worth living. All of my enjoyment comes from my family and friends. \n\nI have tried a handful of antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs. I avoid tablets at all costs due to my past. I have really tried to improve my life, I\u2019ve gone to therapy many times and seen clinical psychologists with expertise in chronic pain but I haven\u2019t found much solace through it. \n\nI really want to feel better, I\u2019ve tried a lot and I\u2019m willing to try more. Deep down, I don\u2019t want to end my life, I just want to end the suffering I feel emotionally and physically. \n\nMy life seems to be an equilibrium of suffering and finding purpose. I want peace and quiet, I\u2019d like to feel better. \n\nI intend to live for now and seek further help, I am really determined to beat all of this. Music is my outlet, I also paint and do poetry to turn all of this into a positive thing. I don\u2019t share any of it though, as it\u2019s quite confronting sometimes.\n\nAnyways, thanks for listening. \nI\u2019m not trying to make it seem like my life is harder than anyone\u2019s, everyone is going through problems and these are mine.",

I knew that I didn\u2019t want this and I decided to reach out for help with my school. They have been giving me help since March and honestly it\u2019s not been enough. \n\nI went to the hospital last week for my my mental health after having a weekend that essentially was just me having a mental breakdown. I went to school on Monday but I struggled to just sit there even in my free period. I had 3 panic attacks in less than an hour. I had been thinking the whole weekend should I go to get some professional help by going to A&amp;E. On Monday i decided to speak to someone that I really trust and I think has the most common sense about what I was thinking of doing. I told him how I had been feeling and asked if he thought it would be a good idea, we had a long talk and I decided that this is what I need to do because my school doesn\u2019t know how bad I really was back at the beginning of the year. I can feel myself coming back to that place and I knew that if I want to genuinely get better and if I want to be alive by the end of the year, I need to go and seek more professional help.\n\nI feel really weird now because my school knows what I did and most of the teachers and people who need to know about this think that I acted really impulsively and irrationally because I had never shown any sign of me not being ok. I try to hide it as much as I can, I\u2019ve felt like there\u2019s something wrong for years now but I\u2019ve tried to hide it and act like I\u2019m fine for so long that it\u2019s just got to the point where it\u2019s so bad that I can\u2019t hide it anymore. I feel kinda shit that people think I\u2019ve gone and done something so drastic for no apparent reason apart from the fact that I had a bit of a low point, even though they don\u2019t actually know that this was a decision that I had thought about for a while and I know myself so well that I knew that this was something I needed to do. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that it makes me feel weird and embarrassed that people think that I did something stupid and irrational but I know that I made an informed decision and if I hadn\u2019t done that and made it a whole big thing, I really cannot guarantee that I would be alive by the end of this year and I don\u2019t want to be in that place again where I saw suicide as an option. I am not an impulsive person I never act on impulse, so it\u2019s annoying to think that that\u2019s what people are thinking of me right now.",

This really sinks me into depression cuz ik its true, i have such a hard time making friends and establishing relationships with people, its my biggest insecurity, everybody knows me at school but nobody likes me, which is really sad, im the guy with no friends, and not even just school, outside too, at my work, public gatherings etc, im obviously the problem and im okay with that but i want to change.\nThat thing i mentioned of people getting irritated by my presence for no reason, yea i have that same feeling with my older brother whos also socially anxious, so im trying to be open minded and see why i feel that way about him, hes quiet too and such a fucking nice person, but maybe he falls into that \"boring\" category too cuz i get annoyed whenever im around him, even when hes not doing anything, i just want him away from me cuz im irritated, i obviously know how he feels now and im trying to redirect my feelings and try to incorporate them to help myself too, but how can i change? I suck at socializing and i just want friends for a change, i also think this was the reason why me and my ex gf broke up, im just a boring bastard with nothing to say :( i dont generate exciting energy, ( i obviously know it comes down to self confidence and such fyi, but besides that)",

When I finished 10th grade my dad and his girlfriend came to my grandparents house and asked me if I wanted to live with them and I obviously said yes). If he caught me texting my mom or talking to my mom on the phone he would take my phone away for a week or two, I definitely felt trapped and hopeless when I lived there...I tried to run away 3 times and it always resulted in him being more verbally abusive towards me. I would always try to call my other family members and tell them what was going on but I unfortunately couldn\u2019t talk to them about it anymore because they would call my dad and tell them what I told them (making the situation worse) it got so bad that I would pee the bed every night because of the emotional stress he put on me. One night he kicked my bedroom door open and started yelling at me because I used the rest of his shampoo and I started crying and shaking because of how confused and startled I was....looking back I think he prevented me from talking to my mom because he knew she would actually listen to me and believe what I was going through (when my parents were together my father also put my mom and my older brother through a lot of emotional stress). I now live with my mother again and my life is a lot less stress free...but my brother unfortunately passed away 2 years ago and that was pretty hard on my whole family and me, I still don\u2019t talk to my father and haven\u2019t seen him in 2 years. I\u2019ve recently been having these dreams of my dad verbally abusing me and chasing me. I\u2019m not so sure if I have emotional trauma or if it\u2019s something else.

My parents want me to marry this girl from Pakistan (I\u2019m not being forced) and I have absolutely no interest in her, not because she\u2019s not good looking, she speaks a different language that i don\u2019t really speak, she is someone who likes school and all that but I don\u2019t, I want someone who I can have fun with, I can share my interest with. I have a hard time talking about it and twice now I broke down to my parents about my thought about it and they encourage me to go through with it but I don\u2019t want to, I love my parents and especially my mom who told me my whole life that this is the girl I\u2019m going to marry, I feel like I had no option, I mean you tell anything to a kid when their young they\u2019ll tell you ok until they get old enough to realize what their getting themselves into, I\u2019m scared with how my life will turn into, I\u2019m blessed in having all the things I have, a loving family, big house, food.

Whenever my friends ask to hang out, I always get depressed cause I know my parents won\u2019t let me hang out with them. I remember being scared of dying, my biggest fear was me just losing my life. Now the thought of me just moving on from this world just gives me hope. (Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m not suicidal or any shit like that). Like I don\u2019t wanna be at fault, if I had to save a random stranger from death but the consequences would me losing my life, I\u2019d do it knowing I saved someone.

All he ever wanted to eat were sandwiches and he blew up over a fucking sandwich and ran away and a whole fucking mess came up and we found out so much in a short amount of time.\n\nI felt like I robbed him of a mother for so long and I feel like this is confirmation. He literally had a psychotic mental break down and he was sent away yesterday to get help for his condition. He fucking despises me. He made so many false accusations about us and started making up stories on the spot, we literally found him walking on the highway. If that were a semi truck driving by he would\u2019ve got hit.\n\nHe was sent to a facility where he would get the help he needs (And a lot more chores and expectations than what we had for him) and then once a group home or a home opens up for him then his stuff will be taken. \n\nHere I am, washing and folding his clothes, packing his stuff and hearing from others that he\u2019s messaging them.\n\nThe worst part is that.. I literally got accepted for my first ever job today and I can\u2019t even be happy about it. I never got to tell him the news because he ran away. People are going to find out about this situation sooner or later, especially if he runs away again. I\u2019m so fucking terrified, this is my little brother and our biological family absolutely hated my mother and us and a hellstorm will break loose.\n\nMy mom, two babies we were taking care of from the system, my cat and now my brother.. they\u2019ve all left me in a span of four months.\n\nWhy did they all leave me? Do I not deserve love? I worked so hard to be loved, but they\u2019ve all left me behind. Fuck, I can\u2019t even think of food right now without feeling the need to throw up. I can\u2019t stop shaking man.\n\nSorry on mobile.",

I\u2019ve always had image issues compounded with depression, and eventually I spiraled out of control regarding self worth.  For example, today I was rewatching a recorded work video for a project. As soon as I hear my voice it started.  I\u2019m sure people are like \u201cI hate my voice lol\u201d but for me it\u2019s \u201cyou sound like a fucking idiot. You\u2019re stupid and maybe you should just die\u201d.  I get the same way seeing pictures except it\u2019s about my weight (obese) and that I\u2019m ugly to be around.   I\u2019ve described my body as holding up a trash bag by the neck and letting it all settle.\n\nI\u2019ve seen two therapists. I used to talk to friends about it but I\u2019ve scared a couple. They\u2019re not trained to handle it so I don\u2019t blame them.  I have no reason to be sad, at all. Yet I am.  I can\u2019t focus on my strengths because to me they\u2019re insignificant.  I don\u2019t want to reach out to people because I don\u2019t want to seem needy, despite knowing I get a strong dopamine response to validation, and I hate it.  I\u2019m not a confused young person either (I was), I am now just a sad 38 year old man.  Ironically I feel most comfortable helping others through their issues and help them see their value, but I can\u2019t seem to accept it when they help me the same way. I feel like they\u2019re wrong and they don\u2019t really know me.\n\nI feel like because I\u2019m a man, I\u2019ll always need to put up this brave front until I die, probably in my apartment, and if I\u2019m lucky someone\u2019s gonna find my body after a week. \n\nI\u2019m not going to do anything stupid... but I feel dead inside already.",

I\u2019ve tried my best to be the son he\u2019s always wanted which was the one who always got good grade, was morally good, and generally the best sibling compared to me older brother who is a drug addict and literally just got kicked out of the house yesterday as well as got terminated from his job because he works for my dad in his company. Then there\u2019s my older sister who is always lazy and stays in her room all day and plays games and really just doesn\u2019t do anything and they are both over 21 keep in mind and still haven\u2019t done anything besides getting  a job I mean my sister doesn\u2019t even have a car or drivers license or anything like that so my dad always compares me to them when I do something good or bad and I don\u2019t like being compared to them because most of the times it\u2019s usually when I\u2019ve done something wrong and I feel like I try my best but he just degrades you and makes you feel like when you\u2019ve done your best that you haven\u2019t even tried and screams at me and my sibling and throws stuff at them and says really offensive stuff to them asking if he needs to check them out for disability\u2019s because they don\u2019t listen and I\u2019m just so scared because I don\u2019t want to be like them because he said many threats saying if I don\u2019t do better than my siblings then he will do all sorts of stuff to me and rain he\u2019ll on me and I\u2019m just so scared I feel like I\u2019m a failure and don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing anymore and it hurts so bad but the main reason why I made this post was to know or find out if this is abuse or not because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being a 16 year old baby or not but if it is abuse then I\u2019ve been dealing with it no joke since I was pretty much born and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore...",

I wake up, I feed the cats, I head out to work, \nrinse and repeat.\n\nI may seem happy, \"you're so sweet\" they say. \n\nLittle do they know, deep down inside, where it REALLY counts most, It's all just an act. I'm hurt and scared and sad and lonely.\n\nI know I'm a loser. I was born with ADHD. I have a Bad job, a car that's falling apart. Oh sure, I'm able to pay my bills, but I can't pay for food, or my phone, or my electricity.\n\nI live paycheck to paycheck. Just one accident, one medical bill, away from bankruptcy. Did I mention my car sounds like shit?\n\nI saw a business guy today on my way to work. I didn't say anything, but he looked so confident. Chest out, shoulders back, hair combed, dark sunglasses on, skin tan. I bet that guy doesn't have a care in the world!\n\nTell me, what is it like to have so much charisma and money that you don't need drugs or alcohol to feel confident or normal? What is it like to drive a fancy car, or run a company, or be in charge of stuff?\n\nI'll never know, because in this life, you have your people who have and your people who have not and in the end you can't truly change what role life gives you.\n\n I'm a have not and not just in terms of material things. I don't have health insurance, I don't have a full time job. I don't have a salary or paid vacation. I don't have a retirement fund.\n\nI just hope the good Lord takes me before I have to worry about retirement. Because I know I'll never be able to afford to retire. \n\nWhat? you mean have enough money to live off of comfortably in my old age? Yeah right.\n\n And the thing is , I don't even want live some lavish life. I'm antisocial. I stay at home and I mind my own because people stress me out with their political views and racist remakes that they sometimes dont even realize their making.\n\nI just want peace folks. I just want to be left alone. I just want to mind my own business. I don't want the spotlight. I don't want to climb the corporate ladder.",

I don\u2019t know what\u2019s f**** wrong with me I just don\u2019t care anymore about anything. The thought of 60+ years more of this for 12 of \u201celderly fun\u201d or whatever is so overwhelming and just sounds like such a waste. I just do things at this point because I feel like they\u2019re expected of me. I have no idea what I wanna do with my life, the thought of even being able to find a job where I\u2019m happy *and* making enough money is so foreign to me. At this point I\u2019m just finishing college cause I started, not because I care about getting a degree. The thought of having to live like this sucks so much idk what to do. I have no motivation, it feels like everything I have ever done was to please somebody else and idek who I am or what I like. I\u2019m about to leave the best years of my life having done nothing, made next to no new connections or friends, all my accomplishments feel fake and not deserved. I think about my \u201cfuture\u201d and all I can picture is a lifetime of self hatred and loneliness. I don\u2019t see myself with a good job, a family (or even a partner), a house, nothing. All I see is a meaningless march towards the grave. I feel like my parents wasted their lives on me, they spent so much money on me as a kid and I\u2019m never gonna amount to how much money they put into me. Without me they could\u2019ve traveled or done whatever but I was/am just a black hole of wasted effort. I guess I know my family loves me, but I\u2019m not very close to many of them, my grandma is getting older and so are my parents and once they\u2019re gone there\u2019s not gonna be a soul left who *really* cares. And how do I repay them? By not getting closer with my family, by being a depressed POS that won\u2019t amount to anything??? My parents want to help, both emotionally and financially, but I don\u2019t really feel like I can trust them a whole lot on the emotional side, and on the financial side, they\u2019re just pouring more into me!!! I don\u2019t wanna accept their money bc I know it\u2019s a waste but I still do it bc I\u2019m too much of a loser to tell them to stop trying and that it\u2019d be better to save it for them for later. I just don\u2019t know what to do at this point. How do people live feeling hopeful about the future? How do I start getting close to people *now*, when I\u2019ve spent 21 years completely inept at making a lasting, long term friendship, let alone a romantic relationship? How tf do you figure out who you are? What you like, what you wanna do, what your goals are? It all just feels fake and pointless at this point, like I\u2019ve missed my opportunity to make myself into a person and now I\u2019m just a drain. Every day is the same, wake up, work, go to bed. Nothing is interesting anymore, not even the stuff I used to love. I feel like a robot but I can\u2019t stop now, that\u2019ll just make things harder for myself. Life will be a little less miserable if I can just get a job I can stay at for the rest of my life. Everything will still suck but at least it wouldn\u2019t be any worse. If I quit now im just gonna make life suck even worse in the future. There are some days I really wish I was just a nobody with nothing ever afforded to him and nobody ever expecting anything and no one to ever let down. Like there are 100s of thousands of people more deserving of my life and upbringing than I was/am who might\u2019ve actually turned out a successful person instead of how I turned out.",

Called about 10 times then got his mom involved to have her call many additional times.. later to find out that she wouldn't be able to do the project that day anyway. When I told my significant other how it all made me feel he basically stated that our anniversary was another day (he has greatly apologized for this but I would be lying if I said it doesn't still stick in my mind) I've come to the conclusion that she is basically infallible and if I want to stay in this relationship I just need to accept all the bullshit that comes with it.

Whether in control of my life, marriage, or thoughts, I truly believed I would win. It all began in 2016 when I began to be bullied at High School. Thoughts of hurting myself would creep in. Exhausted, I would cry for help, but to no avail. Eventually, I would regain control of my life, or rather the illusion of control. I began to distract myself with the pleasures of life to avoid these dark thoughts. This is when I began to play video games, party, and even change my attitude. These were darker times for myself, creating habits I cannot escape. I was madly in love with a girl who wouldn\u2019t look my way, until it was too late. By that time, I had already gotten someone else pregnant, marriage then followed suit. Over the last two years of screaming, fighting, constant arguing, and massive stress, my final moments have come. I decided to run away from the world. Not for any other reason than pure selfishness. Do not mourn for me, tell my kids the truth, their father was a coward. Now, I must make amends with myself to fix the issues I created. This was no one\u2019s fault. No amount of being a better dad, mom, wife, brother, or friend could have fixed this. These simply were my compounded choices resulting negatively in life. I lost the person I used to be, and they never came back. Life made me bitter and unpleasant to be around. For all the damage caused, I am sorry. I wish it did not hurt you, but I can no longer conform to the life I have. Each day I wake in agony, eagerly greeted by the life I have created. It was all too much for me yet my mental state constantly told me to stop. As I digress, do not speak about who I used to be. Remember me as I was, broken, selfish, and miserable. To, whomever is reading, tell my mom I love her, my dad I couldn\u2019t be prouder, my brother he has a gift do not waste it, my wife it was not her fault, and my children to be strong. Tell the girl I once loved it was never meant to be this way. Thank you everyone for being apart of my life, I am on to my next adventure, alone.",

A month after i broke up with her i decided that i wanted to have contact with her cause my feelings for her were still there and she was the only 1 i thought about 24/7, which made me cry everyday.

Never even had friends growing up, moved around too much, just did my best to assimilate with new groups by wearing masks and leaving them behind just as quickly.\n\nOnly ever had one friend in adulthood. Think she did care about me for a while, but I fell in love with her and she didn\u2019t feel the same way. Between that and my constant mentally ill bullshit, guess I scared her away cause she\u2019s barely spoken to me at all for almost 2 years now and I haven\u2019t seen her in just as long.\n\nNever had a girlfriend either. Can\u2019t imagine it would be anything but a total fucking disaster and I don\u2019t think I can handle losing someone I actually care about cause of my own bullshit again. Tried using shit like Tinder but it fucking sucks. Besides, I know I\u2019m not good enough for a relationship so what the fuck am I even trying to accomplish by asking women out? Sex is just fucking pointless to me at this point so I really don\u2019t know what the end goal is and I just stop bothering.\n\nI know people say you\u2019ve gotta love yourself first but I don\u2019t know what the fuck that feels like cause I have nothing to go off. Feels like I\u2019m caught in an endless cycle of \u201ccan\u2019t be loved till I love myself\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t love myself until I learn what being loved is like\u201d. It\u2019s fucking torture. \n\nDon\u2019t even think it fucking matters anymore, think I\u2019ve lost the ability to be around people anymore anyway. Can\u2019t handle it.

Can\u2019t even hold down a job anymore because I can\u2019t speak to the public on a regular basis without doing shit that gets me fired. People just aggravate me and I don\u2019t know how to fix that. Medication doesn\u2019t fix it, doesn\u2019t do fucking anything, neither does therapy. Guess there is no solution.\n\nJust so fucking sick of being completely alone in the world, having to do all this shit by myself every fucking day, with nothing ever getting better or easier. And it\u2019s a fucking catch 22 cause the longer this shit goes on the harder it gets to be around anyone, the worse my truest issues get and the more I realise I\u2019m probably always gonna be fucking unstable to some degree and I\u2019ll never be good enough to have relationships and shit cause I\u2019ve got nothing to offer but chaos and self-destruction.",

I felt understood and happy.\n\nThe kicker is, he tells me partway through the conversation that he\u2019s married. I thought, that\u2019s fine, it means he can\u2019t\npossible be interested in anything but friendship. And I don\u2019t think he was attracted to me or anything, he never flirted or\nanything like that. But he did mention having problems with his wife and then at the end of the conversation, said he wanted\nus to have a relationship where we could tell each other anything. Afterwards, that bugged me and I realized that that kind of \nrelationship with a married man was inappropriate. So, I told him I couldn\u2019t talk to him anymore.\n\nThe problem is, I\u2019m sad because I thought I had found someone to talk to, finally and I was happy.

I don\u2019t want anything to do with anyone anymore and it\u2019s hard for me to hold a conversation.

He\u2019s cheated in the beginning, didn\u2019t want to even be together but did it because he got tired of me asking, sent a girl money while inbetween jobs and i was paying for everything, lied so much, offered to pay for another girls hotel room and stay the night with her to show her around (i live in a big city) but when i would visit him (we used to be long distance) he never offered that. I gave him money because he wasn\u2019t working to find out later he had a savings in his house. And just time and time again he\u2019s shown me through actions i don\u2019t really matter to him.

I' d stop believe in myself so I drop off college and start working a full time job instead. \nI couldn't take it anymore and was scared to blame people for my mistakes, so I just started to cut myself, and pretended that everything was fine. Everytime I felt bad, hopeless, depressed, dumb, unworthy, vexed... I would hide and cut myself because it was my only moments of peace and this way I was sure to not hurt people with words. But when i couldn't cut myself immediately, I would go to WC, taking off my pant and scratching my cuts, just to hurt myself, just to feel something. It ended up being an addiction. \n\nBut last year, I've finally grown some hopes after I saved money. So I've stopped hurting myself, I moved out and start school again (for a session of two years) and this time in something I love. When I felt bad or sad, cutting myself wasn't my first option anymore. It was so natural.

        "selftext": "I hate myself. And everyday I just learn how to hate myself a little more. Lately I feel like it's pointless to try hard and make efforts. I don't feel like pushing myself to the best anymore. \n\nTwo years ago I failed college because of work, so when people around me were graduating I couldn't help but think that I was a shame, a looser, a dumbass... I' d stop believe in myself so I drop off college and start working a full time job instead. \nI couldn't take it anymore and was scared to blame people for my mistakes, so I just started to cut myself, and pretended that everything was fine. Everytime I felt bad, hopeless, depressed, dumb, unworthy, vexed... I would hide and cut myself because it was my only moments of peace and this way I was sure to not hurt people with words. But when i couldn't cut myself immediately, I would go to WC, taking off my pant and scratching my cuts, just to hurt myself, just to feel something. It ended up being an addiction. \n\nBut last year, I've finally grown some hopes after I saved money. So I've stopped hurting myself, I moved out and start school again (for a session of two years) and this time in something I love. When I felt bad or sad, cutting myself wasn't my first option anymore. It was so natural. I was able to think clearly and found good and healthy solutions to problems. \n\nBut at the end of the year, I failed again and didn't get my diploma (the diploma I require doesn't have a big impact on a professional career, but still, I wish I had it).

Before last year I was sober for 3 years and relapsed massively resulting in two accidental drug overdoses that had me picked up off the ground and brought back to life. Before my relapse(s) life was unbearable in lockdown. Living in a very toxic environment and finding myself down the ER with massive 'fake heart attack' panic episodes.\n\nI got through medically assisted detox here in Ireland and back to work, trying to resume my life with some stability and normality. However, it has been an up and down rollercoaster and especially difficult these past few weeks.\n\nI feel like a lab rat that has had their dopamine / reward system removed and I can't find the motivation to do my work or anything terribly productive, which results in a negative feedback loop with all of the old familiar scripts playing.\n\nIn an effort to find some motivation or just something so I can at least do my work and not lose my job, I purchased some Kratom and modafinil. It has helped somewhat but I know it's risky business to be self-medicating and I will likely throw it all in the bin soon.\n\nThis isn't a post about my struggles with addiction but all of the stuff that lives and has lived under my forms of escapism for too long. I'm working with two therapists, engaging in support and take Mirtazapine at night but fuck, I am just sick of everything right now and at times, I wish that they didn't bring me back to life.\n\nI'm under no illusion that life is supposed to be rosy everyday but surely there has to be some answers to these enduring issues!\n\nWishing you all the best on whatever journey you're on",

In fact the only time I\u2019ve ever felt genuine love in a relationship. I didn\u2019t even know I could feel this prior to her. I did it because she wants children and I don\u2019t and the longer we stayed the worse it would be in the future.  I told her she needs to meet somebody who can provide that for her. \n\n  I also a few months later noticed genital warts. We both were sick together with covid and the physical stress of that coupled with the mental stress of breaking up could have caused it to activate. It makes it extra difficult because she loved me so much and I know would have stayed with me end supported me.  I mean it\u2019s possible she even gave it to me, but she doesn\u2019t know I have it. She has diagnosed anxiety and I don\u2019t wanna mention it if it\u2019s not needed. \n\n  It\u2019s now been like 4ish months and I thought I was doing good.  I see she posted a story of the new guy she is dating. It absolutely crushed me and I had an almost panic attack. I\u2019ve never had a therapist before, but I\u2019m actively searching for one now. \n\n  We speak every now and then and last night she called me. I told her how broken down I was when I saw the story and also told her that I\u2019m still happy she met somebody. In a way I truly am. \n\n  The other side of me wants to try and win her back. I\u2019ve been thinking and believe I didn\u2019t want kids just cause I was scared of the responsibility.  I just can\u2019t believe I let go the only person I\u2019ve ever loved and initiated it even. \n\n  Before her I was a happy go lucky single guy and having a great time in life. I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore. I was doing ok prior to this past Saturday in the sense that I wasn\u2019t happy, but I was accepting of the situation. \n\n  I really feel like my life without her is meaningless. She was such a great person and in my time with her I improved myself as a person so much because of her love and support.  I think her and I really should be together. I\u2019m just scared of causing her further grief and pain. \n\n  I\u2019m also scared that I\u2019ve regressed and I\u2019m not the man she even fell in love with. I\u2019m physically in good shape cause I used exercise as a stress relief and I\u2019m in a decent financial situation. Mentally though I feel broken and not myself",

My depression got extremely bad for a while and after I graduated I went to college for a semester and now I haven\u2019t been in school for almost a year and only just now got a job. In the past 3-4 years I haven\u2019t cried a single time from emotions or pain because sadness was my normal emotion. There\u2019s a certain song my ex liked that linked itself to my trauma with her. Today I reflected on a lot of my life while listening to that song on repeat and I cried for the first time in at least 3 years. My crying started off being only pain but then I got happy because I was crying. Me crying showed me that I still had emotion left in my broken soul. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve felt human in so long. \nIf you\u2019ve read up to here I really appreciate you listening to a stranger\u2019s story because it\u2019s kind of like I get to vent.

My life isn't helping me either. I have been preparing for competitive exams since the past 3 months now and have isolated myself. It's only twice or thrice a month I step outside my house and meet my friends.

I rarely watch anything but this is exactly when I think everything went downhill. I did some research and found out that this generally happens after binge watching but now it's been 1 week and I still feel the same, hopeless and lost. \n\nThis is not where I wanted to be in my life, I have suddenly started questioning my relationship. I don't even know anymore if what I am studying for is actually what I want, I feel like throwing away all the work I have put in the last 3 months. I am questioning my own existence, what's the purpose that I am doing what I have been doing, where will it lead me and what do I actually want. Of course, I want to be rich and wealthy but what after? I wait for the day to end so I can sleep. Every night before closing my eyes I hope I feel better tomorrow but it's not working. I am just lost at this point, I tried going out and talking to friends but that's only a temporary fix. I feel as if my life is done, I am 21, living with my parents and haven't done anything significant yet.

Sometimes I even have the impression that my own friends don't even remember that I exist anymore. But I need someone.

I hate who I am, I hate how am I, I hate what I do, what I did in the past, I hate how everyone is with me, but my reactions are so stupid. I'm now in an art school, and I feel so incompetent next to all the other students in my class, even if they all are really kind and funny. Forcing me to smile in front of everyone everyday while I just want to die is so tiring.\n\nEven the things that I love began to bored me years ago, when my depression started. I can't find the motivation to do anything even when I really should. My favorite games, books, now leave me without emotions, just trying to entertain myself to flee this life that I hate so much.\n\nAll that I want is staying in my bed all day waiting for the time to pass, but I know this isn't a true life.

This is the only life I know.\n\nI've been having a really hard time lately dealing with my stress.

I've been married and divorced due to being cheated on, or as she put it, (my mental health and I'm just always sad and suicidal, or i can't love myself so no one will ever be able to love me) . I've recently tried to date again after a year or so of the divorce and was just used because I'm trying to be kind and to be better and just be nice. i just wish someone would just want to come home to me. not make me feel like I'm a burden on this planet. i know people say it'll happen. or just stop searching and it'll come. it'll be there, but i genuinely don't know what it feels like to be loved. abusive parents, any friends have died, and just. i want to be loved. i want to feel loved. the closest i felt was on a ton of shrooms and trying to feel anything and i felt love from what i thought was mother earth, Gaia. but i haven't since then and ran out of shrooms. i just, i want someone to want to be around me, or look at me the way i look at people. i want someone to have a hard day at work (not the hard day part) but to want to just look forward to coming home to me and want to just have me take care of them. i want someone to want to go to a bar and not want to flirt with other people, just flirt with me even if we have been together for years. i want someone to show me off to their friends and on social media, i try so hard to just be me and be healthy and happy, and i go out of my way so much to make sure others are better and happy, and i let people use me just for the chance maybe someone will stick around or keep me around and I'm so desperate to just have someone hold me and tell me I'm worth being loved. it hurts so much when I'm reminded constantly that I'm not. or told by ex's that I'm psychotic because i just want to be around someone all day especially if i enjoy their company. i know i displace it in people but i just want someone to feel that way about me, be clingy, be jealous, just genuinely want me for who i am. i just.. I'm surrounded by friends, and people who are trying so hard to show me that I'm not alone but I've never felt more isolated because i just... i want someone to call my own and i can share these thoughts, or the dark side of my brain and they just hold me and say i love you for who you are and i know they mean it and just aren't using me for a place to stay, or for sex, or money, or because i put them first. i just. why can't i be loved? just. i try so very hard to tell myself i deserve it too, and i want to be just this kind hearted person because i use to be just so angry all the time and i grow tired of people pushing me to be this bad guy and then villainize me when i snap after weeks of mistreatment when all i do is give out love and kindness. i just.. I'm drunk, and just need someone to hold me and let me cry. and i can't even be open with the people around me because my brain refuses to let me be vulnerable because it calls myself a burden or i don't want to make them feel bad, or just i don't know. just.. needed to put words behind it and sorry for being a burden to everyone who has known me. i try and i try but what's the point of it all?. .I'm just pathetic and sad all the time and I'm tired. so so tired of living. if reincarnation exists after I'm gone I'm going to be pissed. just. i wish someone would come along and show me that everything I've been through was for something. me living this long was worth it. but if my own mother couldn't love me, then why should anyone else.",

        "selftext": "Normally I don\u2019t mind the loneliness, I know that I choose to be away from people because they\u2019re not worth the trouble to me. Because all my past experiences have gone to hell and I\u2019d rather spend the rest of my life completely alone then ever have to deal with any of that shit ever again. At least I\u2019m used to dealing with loneliness, and besides, most people only make me feel more alone. But this is one aspect of loneliness that rears up every so often and it\u2019s like a kick to the chest.\n\nI\u2019ve never had a girlfriend. Only ever been in love once, with my best friend at the time but that whole situation was fucked because she didn\u2019t feel the same way and it basically killed the only real friendship I\u2019ve ever had. So I don\u2019t allow myself to feel that shit anymore. But I feel so touch-starved. When I do those love language tests I always get physical touch, but I also don\u2019t allow people to touch me (not that anyone ever really tries), I feel weirded out by it somehow and I reel back, hugs and stuff make me uncomfortable. It\u2019s like I\u2019m so touched starved, but I also can\u2019t handle being touched.\n\nI\u2019ve tried having a casual sex every now and then but it feels like that makes everything way worse. I just feel numb to everything I guess, I can barely feel the touching and it only makes me feel more alone. I\u2019m so numb at this point I can\u2019t even orgasm during sex, I\u2019ve literally never been able to. That only adds to the feeling that I\u2019m just broken and alone. That I\u2019m supposed to be alone because all the evidence points to the fact that even though I think I want closeness, it\u2019s not something I can ever have.\n\nMainly this thought gets me while I\u2019m in bed at night though. I can\u2019t even describe how much I want someone next me. Someone to keep my bed warm. Someone who I can hold in my arms and who I can feel them hold me back. I feel like I don\u2019t have to guess where I stand when I\u2019m in someone\u2019s arms, for a brief moment I can just trust that they love me. And I can hold them back, knowing they\u2019re not going anywhere, that at least in that moment, they\u2019re with me. I want some who can lay with me and sleepily whisper \u201cgood night\u201d and \u201cI love you\u201d and all those tiny things I don\u2019t ever get to hear. Someone who\u2019s subtle breath I can listen to to lull me to sleep. Someone who I can wake up with and want to spend the day with, not that awkward feeling of subtle regret where you\u2019re trying to figure out the least insulting way to get them to leave the morning after.\n\nI feel so pathetic, but I want it so bad that I hold onto a pillow every night, like it\u2019s a pretty girl who loves me. Sometimes I squeeze it so tightly, just willing it to be a person. Other times I spend hours listening to audio clips on YouTube of people doing girlfriend role plays while I gently stroke the surface of the pillow, imagining it\u2019s her back or her arm or down her side. Not that I had any money anyway, but I wish you could pay someone for this, to just lay in bed with you every night, so that you can just have someone to hold onto, feel someone in your arms. I wouldn\u2019t even care if they were always gone when I woke up, just for that brief window, I could feel connected to someone.",

My psychologist told me that I\u2019m in the direction of a burnout. This is the first internship and I have only 1 month left. Things get worse the past few days and I woke up crying today. And I took a wrong turn by messaging this guy. \n\nI met him on Bumble and things went as online dating should. I was with the intention of something fun as usual but I fell for him. For the first time I fell for someone this hard, all the emotions and feelings I\u2019ve never experienced before. But nothing can happen between us since he said that we should just be friends and I was lying to myself and agreed. We did cuddle and talk and I feel happy and understood by talking to him. But after we had sex, he grew distant and it\u2019s very clear. I tried to be a \u201cbad bitch\u201d as I should haha. But I can\u2019t stay away from him. I messaged him randomly, trying to start conversations, I let him cross many boundaries and I know I shouldn\u2019t have done that to myself. I even pretended I\u2019m fine and laughing when he talked about him hanging out with other girls. I never have the courage to tell him how I feel and cut him off because I don\u2019t want to lose the contact but I guess from now on I would not see or hear anything from him again.\n\nSo I told him I cried for 2 hours yesterday in  a funny way (how I deal with my struggles) and he made a joke. I woke up crying and saw his rely on IG first and I just texted him my true feelings, that I\u2019m stressed out and I even have suicidal thoughts. I don\u2019t know why I did that because I was hesitant and indeed it was a bad decision to say that to him, a person I met for 3 months whom I\u2019m not sure what our relationship is. He replied, saying that I should talk to friends and see a psychologist and that I shouldn\u2019t \u201cdrop a bomb and make people feel obligated to reply even though they feel uncomfortable to do that\u201d. Now I feel worse because he was right and I can\u2019t get this out of my head. I don\u2019t know why I did that. I apologized and I said I didn\u2019t mean to make him feel that way and I will stop texting. I deleted IG. To be honest, I only share my struggles with some closest friends so far and I was taken over by my thought of liking him and hoping I would get some comfort.\n\nNow part of me is relieved because maybe I can get over him now since it\u2019s clear his intention. But I can\u2019t help but blaming myself for my impromptu action and I regret ending things on a bad note. So far he is the most compatible guy I have met but I need to stop telling me that. I feel so bad crossing the line and it adds up to my anxiety. I don\u2019t want him out of my life.",

I don\u2019t have a traumatic past like others, just an abusive father that constantly beat my mom and my older brother. I was never hit because I was a girl and a child. It did leave a lasting mark though. I was never able to help the people I cared about, no matter what I do. I believe this has led me to have zero self confidence.\n\nThe suicidal thoughts started when I was 9, and now, partially because of Covid, they\u2019re getting worse. Every time I\u2019m alone, I\u2019m drowning in self pity and hate. I try and talk to some of my friends, but they just laugh at me and don\u2019t take it seriously. I don\u2019t blame them. They\u2019re still young, although older than me.\n\nOne time, when i was practicing skating, I made no progress at all. Past me would\u2019ve just brushed it off, but that day, I had a breakdown. I sat off the ice, willing the tears not to fall, but failed.\n\nAlso, I have no motivation for anything. Before,I used to do things because they were fun. Now, they just seem like a waste of time to me.\n\nI may be young, and that is one of my insecurities, but please don\u2019t treat me differently than anyone else.\n\nSome days, I feel awful. Is it wrong that I\u2019m constantly sorry for myself? I feel as if I\u2019m just doing this for attention, but thats not it. If you\u2019ve read this far, thank you.

I want to finally be free from this pain I have not been able to identify for years now.\nEvery time I would get contacted by the crisis team they would ask me what triggered all of this and what happened for me to get to this point, but I had nothing to say.\nI am just human garbage and fucked in the head.\nI don\u2019t want people to private message me or tell me not to do it please, I am set on my choice and I made research so it is not done on an impulse. \nAt this point, I don\u2019t see myself changing or getting better, I tried everything I could and got the necessary help, all that did was me wasting people\u2019s time and public services, and in this sense I am just a burden to society in many ways.\nI know there will be some smart asses saying something along the line of \u00ab\u00a0well fucking contribute to society then\u00a0\u00bb but I can\u2019t, I am genuinely useless and have no skillset that will be of any use. \nI have been depressed since I was 12/13 but I was too young to understand what was happening to me, then teen years happened and I struggled a lot (don\u2019t want to go into details). Then I thought shit would get better as I moved to study but had my first major depressive episode when I was 20. Failed a whole year because of that. I kept struggling and barely got my degree with some very mediocre grades despite the extensive support I received from university. I graduated, and like the useless piece of shit I am, I moved back to my parents, from my dad\u2019s place to my mom\u2019s, and proceeded to being a human vegetable for 2 years doing nothing but breath air. Both parents were distressed as I am an only child and felt heavily burdened by my presence. Then I somehow managed to get accepted to an MA course which is honestly fucking hilarious/ridiculous as to how I managed that, but my parents mainly pushed me to do it because they wanted me out and they wanted me to move on from that space/situation. So I left again to study and now I am at the lowest point of my life. I haven\u2019t attended university for an entire unit, classmates are celebrating graduation that is awaiting. I got extenuating circumstances and people who want to help me but I can\u2019t do this anymore. I really can\u2019t. I am genuinely uninterested in everything and it got to the point where I feel detached from everything and can\u2019t even care anymore. \nIt\u2019s not like there wasn\u2019t help available, so many people tried to help me but I never managed to change or get better.\nToday I was admitted to the hospital and had a panic attack, I asked to leave as a person there said they didn\u2019t know what to do with me and it speaks volume.\nI am tired of talking to countless strangers about the whys and hows and to be honest I don\u2019t even have the answers.\nI feel like the people who were trying to help me just got sick and tired of me and it\u2019s very understandable.\nSure I went through some stuff but my life isn\u2019t this bad to the point someone would die, if anything I had a \u00ab\u00a0lot to look forward to\u00a0\u00bb but this doesn\u2019t interest me. I ruined my chances that were offered to me on a silver platter because I am useless like that.\nI also isolated myself so much there is nobody I can talk to. \nI also lost faith in everything.\nI know it will sound stupid to a lot of people but I genuinely think the problem is me and I can\u2019t be fixed. I tried everything and I am tired of wasting people\u2019s time and being a financial burden to my parents. Yes of course I feel sorry for them but I really cannot live on. I don\u2019t want to exist anymore. I want to be gone.\nThe pain and need to end myself out weight all the rest, I don\u2019t want to fight or try anymore. I am tired.

She's been like family to me, which is important  since I  haven't   been   with my own family in years.\n\nLast       week, I was feeling a bit lonely since I didn't have any other     friends     in town at the time, and I reached out to her asking if we     could hang     after work. She replied saying that she had just gotten     into a     relationship and would never have any free time for me.   This   felt     hurtful, and I texted her that it  wasn't   fair and      that I wasn't asking for much. I immediately  regretted   this, and  sent    an  apology text, but the damage was done.\n\nShe       accused me of not being considerate of her boundaries and that I   was       being manipulative. I should have left it at this stage, but I   had       several other stressors in life along with severe depression   and       anxiety. One of my biggest fears has always been losing  close   friends. I      thought our relationship was damaged, and I  wanted to   regain  control    of  the situation. I sent her several  long texts   basically   apologizing   and  asking her to forgive me and  give me   another chance. I   realize  this  was  the exact opposite of  what I   should have been   doing, but I didn't want to lose someone  who has been the closest thing to family to me. The next day, she  replied saying she was not ignoring me, and she would respond to me when  she felt ready. She then proceeded to block me on all social media.\n\nDo   I   have any hope of   salvaging the situation at this point? Is it  too      late for me? What's   worse is that we still have to work  together,  and I     feel that the   workplace has turned really toxic  for me.

Well, not THE world but our civilizations and way of life will end, we may even go extinct. This may be good news for some of you, but I am a type 1 diabetic so I don't have many options in such a situation other than going on my own terms or letting the disease take me, I was supposed to die anyway because of diabetes but was lucky enough to be born with modern medicine so I get to live as the undead.\n\nPeople will never stop destroying the planet, when the ice melts all the superpowers will race to those last remaining resources or even escalate into a cold war or WW3. All the fish will become extinct, oxygen could deplete, CO2 and Methane and Water Vapor will choke the skies as will pollution. Navy ships will pollute so many coasts and sea water with plastics, when they get destroyed in war. Best case scenario, a global nuclear explosion will end our misery quickly.

I've suffered from depression for over a decade now, and when I thought I \"beat it\", it left me like an empty shell.

I was paired with a disgusting old man who harrassed me and creates gossip and the most toxic crap you can come up with and lost story short, is stuck in that 70's retrograde mindset. It's beyond me why he's here but that's honestly not the point. He's not going anywhere, but I will.\n\nI've had enough, and this decision is impulsive and unwise because I don't have another job lined-up (I have savings), but I seriously can't go on. Once I'm back to being unemployed I'll probably drown in even more misery in my bedroom because I do that even while emplyed! but I won't have to pretend anymore, I won't have to worry about how I'm going to be harrassed the next morning, or how I'm going to be screamed at or exploited by my boss for a shit salary.\n\nI haven't spoken to anyone about this but I decided to post it here because maybe, just maybe I won't be judged.

I started abusing all kinds of drugs expect for meth, cocaine &amp; heroine, i was partly involved with gangs &amp; this was all just leading me up to my know diagnosed depression, i guess you can say i always knew i was depressed but i only got diagnosed not to long ago, &amp; i\u2019m trying to get better, i\u2019ve got a job a lovely girlfriend i\u2019ve made amends with my parents, but it haunts me still to this day, &amp; i\u2019m just sharing my story for the first time.

The thought just appears in my head and nags over and over when I feel sad. \n\nSometimes I look at a structure in my yard and imagine a noose hanging from it, without even trying to. It just pops into my head. It would be so easy.\n\nMy girlfriend moved away and broke up with me and I have no friends. Most of the people in the small town that I live in are retired, so there aren\u2019t many young people here. The last two semesters of college have been completely online, so I haven\u2019t made any friends there, and I failed all except one of my classes this last semester because I got too depressed. I have no friends and no way to meet some because nothing happens in this town and everything closes early. \n\nI got on some dating apps and very occasionally get matches after swiping for hours, but they either don\u2019t respond or stop responding quickly, not to mention most of the people I see on there live an hour+ away. \n\nI\u2019m also just too weird and all over the place for anyone to want to date me, and I\u2019m skinny and can\u2019t gain weight. I also have cognitive problems including a learning disability, some of which might be from years of untreated depression, which has been known to cause cognitive decline. I feel dumb because I\u2019m so slow and easily confused. I can\u2019t remember how to get anywhere in this town I grew up in or do even the simplest arithmetic.\n\nI want to hook up with someone if the opportunity comes up but I have a feeling it won\u2019t fix anything.\n\nI tried reaching out to a girl I went to high school with but I think I just weirded her out. The pandemic has really f*cked me over. I was so happy with my girlfriend and in person school and my friends that I had there before this all happened and we went our separate ways. F*ck china, fuck the virus, fuck the communist party and the way they let this nightmare happen. Also fuck trump and the other evil and selfish people from his administration that caused more loss of life from the virus than there could have been.\n\nAll I want is to get back to something like what I had before the virus, but it feels like it will never happen. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I will be able to respond to many people, but thanks for reading and I wish you the best.",

I have a very deterministic and nihilistic way of viewing life which is my cope for being such an utter quitter and weak willed individual, I will always find a way to negotiate myself into not making an attempt to fix myself, despite knowing everything I need to actually fix my circumstances.

I was one of those retarded teenagers who obsessed over guns and tanks and military larping. I wanted to join the Army asap, but then I got brutally fat (350lbs+) and can't join for this reason, so the only thing I felt passionate about in life is completely out of reach.

I\u2019m consumed full of negative energy and really really hate myself. \n\nThere\u2019s really two pieces of this story. So first my best friend and I. We\u2019ve been best friends for about 2 years and met at an anime convention. Hit it right off as we\u2019re both really into videography and anime. We brought a girl into our group recently and that added a lot of unexpected drama because she\u2019s very flirty with everyone. Right before this weekend it got really weird because she made a joke about them doing stuff behind my back. With the way she acts around us I figured it was true. Anyway we were working through that as a group and our vibe was really off. We talked it through and I know they weren\u2019t messing around. The only reason it had a big impact was because my friend and I talked about it like a week before this and he swore they weren\u2019t and we promised neither of us would because we didn\u2019t want drama. \n\nNow for the second piece I had invited my ex from 2 years ago to share a room with me and my friend. She asked if she could bring a friend I thought ni big deal. I found out it was actually a guy she was fucking. I don\u2019t have a right to be upset about that at all but I really was torn up. I think it\u2019s because my memory of my time with this girl was the last time my dad was healthy and before he began dying. Either way I was pretty torn up by this. So my friends wanted to get me really drunk hell I wanted to get really drunk and that\u2019s exactly what i did. As we\u2019re talking they suggest we just go kick her out. So about 5 of us went up to the room and made her and the guy clean up their stuff and get out of the room at like 3 am. Not only that but I went off on the girl who came to con with me about how she wasn\u2019t a real friend for not supporting me in what was a horrible decision. So here I am fucked yo my relationship with my best friend, another friend, and devastated my ex and completely ruined that relationship. I am the most toxic person and ever fiber of my being hates me right now. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk",

I am still fucking stuck. And I am old, 27 is not a good age. \nMy story is not simple, therefore, I am going to be as brief as possible:\n\n I am the twin brother of an amazing and clever guy, who is affected by a severe motory disability since birth (we had some problems with the placenta, I was too little fed, he was fed too much and couldn\u2019t breathe, I survived with no issues, meanwhile my brother was given a pill that made him breathe, but damaged some motory braincells). I have a little sister too, 12 years younger than me.\n\nI have always loved my brother, with great affection, but \u201crecently\u201d (since I had 18 years, basically) I made up with my conscience that I also hate him. \nI am the first to gets up to help him when he chokes on something at lunch or dinner, once I have performed him the Heimlich maneuver and I saved him. That damn chicken breast piece flew over the table. I was not a good brother sadly, I have always spent time alone, and whenever there were friends with us, I almost always tended to forget about him. \nI always help him, but that\u2019s it. \nThis is one, if not the most unforgivable thing about myself. Even with our adolescence and adulthood I rarely hanged out with my brother.\nTo my defence, I always had hard times going out with some friends, many times I was mocked on, ridiculed, sometimes I laughed at it, most times I felt bad inside. \n\nI was victim of bullism at 11, first year of the \u201cmedie\u201d in Italy. \nI am a very distracted person. I get nervous and say stupid things, or most times remain just silent. I can be enjoyable to hang out with at times, I am not always like that, but I really feel the struggle to exit and hang out with people. \nI probably had always the tendency to feel bad about myself, to feel wrong, weird, that\u2019s why probably I lacked the strength to push my brother\u2019s wheelchair out of home. \n\nAfter a long and irregular career at the high school (liceo), in which I could have excelled, but never dared to, I discovered two things: my love for languages, and the feeling of being totally messed up. \nI had sex for the first time at 20 years old, and with a foreign girl, the only really good thing about this half of my life.\nSix, seven years ago I had my first big depression, I never left my home for six months, after being rejected by a girl I dated for a long time. \nAfter one year we got together again, and then we broke up after three months. \n\nI tried to enter at Medicine University, then did two years of Pharmacy, then did one of Law, then I changed to Psychology. \nI am closer to the graduation, I am slow by myself, lockdown slowed everything, and accentuated my tendency to stay locked in my room. \n\nMy parents, two beautiful people and lawyers, are really annoyed by me now. They are sad, they don\u2019t know what to do, what to think, what to TRY.  \nMy psychotherapy is progressing, but I am still stuck and I don\u2019t know what to do. I am scared of everything.\nMy sister is 14 and she is already struggling with anxiety and binge eating disorder, her diets never work for her, she\u2019s very good at school, a lot more organised and regular than me, but for this problem she\u2019s cause of continuous stress and fights between my parents, just like me.\n\nOccasionally, they already called me \u201cuseless\u201d, \u201clazy\u201d. They look at me more and more like if I was betraying them, like if they despised me, sometimes they say \u201chi\u201d to me, like I was expected to go away.  \n\nI am scared for my future, scared for my life without my parents (may they die OLD), scared for my brother, who loves me, but just got the weakest brother in history. I am scared of life, and I keep having suicidal thoughts every time.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Should I get a job and force myself out, trying to discipline myself? Should I just keep studying as hard as I can? Should I change course again, go to languages (it was my \u201ccloset\u201d \u201cdream\u201d, even if I am not even sure if I had ever been able to want something for my future)... Should I just kill myself and call it a day? Who in the world am I, at last??\n\nSorry for the rambling guys. \nThere\u2019s people who stay much worse than this, and I feel a total garbage.",

Displaying any negative emotions at home will not be possible as my parents will ask why those emotions have  registered, and then, if I fail to tell a convincing lie, will surely guilt me. I also can not show many negative emotions at school, for fear of being falsely reported to the office or other professionals for suicidal thoughts. School isn't great either, and I have been told that it is not uncommon for children like me to leave school with PTSD, which I have told my parents, and  they have ignored it, even after being told by the same professional, choosing to shove it to the back of their minds and forget  about. On occasion, my mother keeps going on about how this school is great, and tells me that alternatives are never going to  work with me. I have told her to stop talking about this, but she never does, showing 'concern' when i run off to hide. In school, I have had multiple past bullies, and some active ones, which cause me mainly mental harm, and giving me anxiety spikes whenever i am near a bully, past or present. This, coupled with the fact that I have no friends that I can talk to is greatly damaging, and when a bully is reported to the staff by me, either nothing is done about it, or I never hear back about it, even if it is a near life-threatening thing.",

        "selftext": "My father has made the biggest impact in my life. To this day I hurt thinking about him. My father died when I just turned 11 year. Not even half of my life anymore and I still cry thinking about him. He had the biggest impact in my life even now. Everything I do and say makes me think about him. Would he have approved of the choices I made or have yet to make. What would he do in my situations. What advice would he give me? I lost him so soon in my life and it hurts so much to think about it. Why did he get sick? Why isn't he in my life anymore? I didnt deserve to lose him. I dont want to hurt anymore because of this but it just won't go away. I hate this. So much experience in my life I shouldn't have had to go through without him but I did. I looked up to him. He was/is my role model. I can't stop this pain that arrived upon his death. The images of him that I have will never be enough. I want him in my life now more than ever. I have so much in my life I wish to share with him. All the hard times and all the best times in my life. Losing someone so important in my life is not something I can get over, it does not get easier as time pass by, it will never make sense to me as to why I had to lose him. Right now it hurts me more than anything that I lost him. I know I'm being selfish and making it about me but I just need to say this. I suffered more than anyone else. I tried to be strong because I wasn't the only one in pain. I tried not to cry a lot because I didn't want to bring out the pain that others suffered too. When I saw my mom or brother cry it hurt me more. I hate that the people I cared most about was in pain too and I couldn't help much. Even though we had a lot of people in our lives that cared about us and that we cared about, no one could make the pain go away. We all suffered terribly and that made it so much more worse. I know that they still hurt when they think about because I still do. I wish he never died. I wish he never got sick. I hate it so much. I wish he knew my little girls. He would have loved them so much. He wanted a little girl. He wanted the princesses that I had and they could been his princesses. I know they would have been because me and kenneth were his princes. He always showed us his best side and never showed us his worst. I want him to know my wife and daughters. I want him to see my apartment. I want him to be alive. I want him to be in my life for a much longer time because I want to show him in person how happy I am and how much happier I can be. I deserve that and so do my kids. They deserve to have my father in their lives. Alison and Sarah. They deserve a grandfather like my father would have been. It sucks. It sucks so much. I hate it more than anything. I want you to make me smile and laugh again. I want you to make me feel safe when I had nightmares or night terrors. I dont want to have memories of u being sick or you dead. I dont want the memories or your brothers and sisters crying or your mother(My abuella &lt;3) throwing herself to the ground crying because she lost her youngest child and had to bury instead of him bury her. Those are thing no 11 year old deserves. Memories I dont want. Memories that make me cry when I think of it. You left behind your mother, siblings, nieces and nephews, cousins, a fiance, and most painful your kids. I know it wasn't intentional and I know you didn't want to. The way you treated us and the way you acted around us shows that you didn't. I didn't know your struggles or your pain because u sheltered us from that like a father should. You took care of us, made us laugh, occasionally made us breakfast and even disciplined us when need which was rarely but it did happen. I have nothing but good memories for when u are healthy and not sick. I want those days back and I want a lot more than that. I want u to grow old watching your kids become men and start a family. I want you to give me your advice, I want you to visit your grandkids and meet your daughters in law. I want you to watch us be a happy family and I want you to be a grandfather. I just don't understand why did I lose you so soon. I can't even talk about how I feel to anyone. I dont know how to talk about it or who would listen. I missed going to your jobs at the auto glass and seeing you fix the windows. I always wanted to learn amd help you. If I'd grown with you in my love I would have probably work with you a little. I never got to experience father son stuff in my teen or grown up years and wish I did. I wish with all my heart that your cancer was cured for good and that you never died. Maybe than I wouldn't have to have been depressed most of my teen years. Maybe than I wouldn't have to have suffered such pain from losing you. I miss you dad and that has and never will. If reincarnation was real I'd love to have you and my mom be my parents again and if heaven is real I'd love having you and everyone I want there with me. If life after death is real id make you my dad again and if everyone had gotten one wish I would have wished you were alive and healthy at least until you 90 years old. My family and I would have been extremely lucky to have you for such a long time. I wish I had someone to help me cope with my father passing. Not my mom, not my brother, or even anyone I knew. I was 11 years old and even though I did I felt like I had no one to talk to. I didn't want to talk to my mom or brother because I didn't want to hear \"they know how I felt or they was going through the exact feelings I was\" because they wasnt. Maybe it was similar or almost the same but not EXACTLY the same. I wanted to talk about what I felt and what I miss. I wanted to ask questions that people couldn't answer because those questions helped me express how I felt and still feel. I know it doesn't make sense to some people but it makes sense to me. I wanted to scream these question at someone. I wanted to blame someone. I wanted someone to hate with all my heart even if they had nothing to do with it because even that would have been better than the pain of losing someone as loved and looked up to as a father. A father who was there for your whole life and took care of you and had done their best to raise you as a father should have. A father who taught you what it means to be a good person and did everything they could to make you happy or safe. Unfortunately I didn't have anyone like that to blame. Only myself for feeling that way. I was hurt and the only thing I can do is try not to make anyone else sad or cry so I waited till it was night time and cried to myself hoping no one would hear or see me. I cried my self to sleep most of my childhood and teenage years.\u00a0 Ever since the lost of my father I am afraid of losing everyone else.\u00a0",

My grades are average, my work experience is average, my major is average (english bc I wasn't smart enough for stem though I'm not particularly good at writing either), my social life is average if not poor. I keep telling myself things will get better, especially since covid fucked up everything (I was ready for an actual university life experience) but I don't know if it will. \n\nAll my life I felt lonely and friendless. In every group I was left out, barely in the clique, and unappreciated. It was a miracle if someone even included me in anything. I was so shy as a kid so that made things worse and I was targeted in HS by this one girl who I guess didn't like me being in the friend group. Of course I didn't stand up for myself because I wanted to fit in so badly. I just took it like a loser. So now I cling onto any semblance of kindness or friendship from a person because I just want THAT group of friends, you know those girls who just love each other, have fun, and genuinely seem to like each other. \n\nI even joined a fucking sorority so I could make friends and feel accepted but no such luck. (honestly don't know how I got accepted into one considering I'm fat, awkward, and have mediocore grades and presence. The group I thought I finally made my lifelong friends with have distanced from me and I really think it's because I'm so average in everything. They're getting internships this summer and hanging out with their besties and boyfriends and they just look so pretty, perfect, and happy. \n\nI keep thinking - when will it be my turn? \n\nI also feel like a blank template. I have no talents or hobbies either. Nothing to make myself stand out. All I do is go on my phone and shop and work. I feel so bad for my mom whose such a kind genuine soul and she was cursed to be married to my dad and have me. A failure of a daughter. Someone who isn't beautiful, intelligent, athletic, skinny, hardworking, useful or talented in any aspect. I don't want to go on with my life but I'm also a coward who's scared of suicide. I already see my future as a lonely fat depressed old woman MAYBE working some dead end job while everyone else lives their perfect pretty lives. What makes it worse is that my sister is currently this and I fucking don't want to be her. She's horrible and verbally abusive with anger issues and stressed both my parents out to no ends. She's in her mid 30s with no degree &amp; work experience, doesn't help around the house, asks my parents for money, plays games all day and gets mad at everyone when things don't go her way. \n\nI feel so frustrated with my life. I want to change it but every time I attempt to do something I feel so tired and stuck. I try to exercise but it's hard to just get out of bed. I can't get up at all sometimes. And when I do have energy to exercise I don't get that \"high\" that everyone says they get. I'm not happy at all. It doesn't help me. I've tried anti depressants and they don't help much either, just makes me feel blank and empty. At least I feel something now. Therapy was meh I'm not hopeful about my new therapist that I'll get in contact with from my school but at least it's something. \n\nI wasn't always this sad though. I was always mediocore though but at least I was somewhat happy and healthy. Now I'm sick - almost diabetic and have PCOS (so facial hair yay!!! as if I already wasn't feeling unfeminine due to my size). And I wanted to cry when my doctor told me it'd be extremely hard for me to lose weight with PCOS. I feel like there's just no hope for me. \n\nIf I manage to graduate then what? I get lucky and end up with an entry level job that I most likely won't advance at or love? I already have little to no friends that'll move on with their own lives, no love life, and no financial support for my mom (who's sick too), and no way to move from this hellhole I call home. I hate my home because my sister is there and refuses to leave and I hate my city and country. \n\nI wanted to live. I really wanted to. I had goals, hopes, dreams shit like that once. Now I feel so so empty and useless and confused and stuck and IDK I'm all over the place. Each day feels so hard and I absolutely despise waking up. I cry myself to sleep every night and I'm just stressing my mom more with my behavior. I'm crying right now as I'm typing this. I feel so tired. I just really needed to rant. I'm sorry.",

Like probably what I'm going to study In uni. I feel terrible about this I don't feel like I fit in with other students , I still feel kind of aimless and trapped here.

I don't sleep properly, eat enough meals, live properly anymore. The pandemic doesn't help, I don't have friends basically and i just wander aimlessly in uni like a weirdo being anxious and I get embarrassed a lot in front of people because I'm so out of place .. \n\nIdk what to do I just feel like I'm so consumed by this situation I overthink all day long about how much money I spent to prepare for the entrance exams and I just don't feel passionate or competitive enough. Yes , objectively it is a very good degree opening several opportunities. Yes, I KIND OF like and I'm doing quite well academically, yes it is hard. No, Im not passionate. No I'm not so thrilled about related jobs. I'm not interested enough for anything to be honest.\n\nAfter these conflicting thoughts that plague my mind I just feel freaked out and like I'm going to vomit and die of heart attack or something.

Basically I\u2019ve had a fairly amazing upbringing both my parents have well paying jobs and have stayed together despite it getting close sometimes, most people would say I was spoiled as a kid and I would agree to an extent however it only really started when my little brother turned five or so as he was diagnosed with autism so my parents began giving him pretty much anything he wanted which also applied to me to since they didn\u2019t want to show favouritism they were definitely more lenient with my brother though. I first really started feeling depressed when I entered junior high however it was mostly was a product of the phase I was in and manifesting the feelings by trying to be like many of the friends I hung around with however even after I stopped hanging out with them in high school I still felt the same and it started getting worse when I began getting crushes and asking people out as I was definitely sort of labeled as the weird kid but from what I learned at the time it was normal to feel that way after rejection and breakups so that\u2019s what I chalked it up to fast forward to now I haven\u2019t had a job as I never felt the need for one as I didn\u2019t need to pay for anything and I was always focused on school, I\u2019m 20 years old now still living with my parents I\u2019m in my third year of college taking my first year of nursing all my school is payed for I\u2019m in the healthiest relationship I\u2019ve ever been in which has lasted more than a year now and I\u2019m doing fairly well in all my courses despite all of this I still feel depressed some days debilitatingly so my girlfriend wants to move in together however neither of us have the money and I really can\u2019t because of college I feel horrible for disappointing her despite her saying she\u2019s not disappointed we also have had very different upbringings which sometimes makes me feel bad for the way I was raised as we don\u2019t agree on things regarding life my parents put a fair amount of pressure on me with my studies but I would say it\u2019s necessary as I can be rather unmotivated most of the time. All of these things definitely contribute to my depressive feelings however what I would say is the biggest contributor would be the fact I want to get a job after Christmas however I have utterly no motivation to do so because of my depressive feelings but because of that I feel more depressed. The realization that I\u2019m 20 and I haven\u2019t had a job, haven\u2019t lived on my own, can still barely hold a conversation to save my life, and I have little to no life experience makes me depressed and I know it shouldn\u2019t and the fact that it does makes it worse and I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019m not suicidal or anything at least not to the extent that I\u2019d ever do something, I just want to feel better",

My brother died some years ago and my parents have always told me that I should have been the one that died, I cry myself until morning wondering why is this happening to me, I don\u2019t eat, i don\u2019t care about my health in any regard and I don\u2019t talk to anyone about this at school, I feel like I\u2019m in hell and that there is no way out, I lost hope on everything at this point, I don\u2019t want to kill myself but I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore, I just wish that my parents cared about me",

It sent me into a world of darkness and I felt like I had a storm cloud following me everywhere I went.  \n\nNow, I\u2019ve never been a very social person when it comes to being in public, I guess my self esteem is not that great to the point where I feel like I should not even try to be social. I digress.  \n\nFeelings of depression are met with deep sense of anger towards myself and ultimately towards the whole situation I am in. Im on medication to keep the dark cloud away from everyday activities but I still have moments where I could punch a whole in the wall in anger.\n\nWhy so angry you ask? Because I, not being the social butterfly, met this amazing woman who was beautiful in every sense of the word. Athletic, funny, caring and oh so positive about life. These kind of traits that bring out the best of me and my life changed in so many positive ways. I\u2019m on cloud 9 and we are inseparable. Never got physical with eachother never argued. We just really enjoyed the company and time together. A future was guaranteed to be bright together. But a few events out of our control through friends and family opened up some holes and created some doubt in her mind. Which put a strain on our relationship that we tried to recover from but she eventually had too much and called it quits. \n\nSo yeah, the anger is still prevalent. How could I let such an all around beautiful girl lose interest enough to the point that a simple talk and change of direction couldn\u2019t fix. I am still crushed. Again being unsuccessful in the social world I now feel like I\u2019m doomed for life. In my 30s struggling to still pick up myself while living at home and not having a strong base of success to build on to even be attractive enough for a girl to want to spend time with. I\u2019m tired of giving my family and friends the same old depression updates because nobody seems to care, and if they do care they have no answers for me. So I keep my feelings and thoughts locked inside which makes everything oh so much worse.\n\nI\u2019m a mess and I\u2019m spinning my wheels. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?",

I don't go anywhere because I find it difficult to go alone and I tell myself that everyone is busy and I don't need to bother them. When I do talk myself into asking, they are busy and it usually triggers a downward spiral of being unwanted.\n\nThe fog inside my head has gotten so thick that I struggle to make it through a few hours without forgetting the things that have happened or completely ignoring the world around me and fading away into the mist of my own thoughts and sorrows. Sometimes it seems just like I've walked into an extremely thick fog, alone and afraid, and I will never find my way out.\n\nI don't know what has caused this to get so much worse than normal. I am taking my medications like I'm supposed to. I am doing everything that I can to keep myself from crashing and burning, but I am so tired of feeling like one my grain of sand will shatter me. \n\nI don't feel like I have the energy to keep this fight up for much longer. I keep telling myself that I can't break because I have too many people depending on me. I realize that sometimes even the strong have to be supported, but my support system is gone.

Several med changes and then I lost insurance and couldn\u2019t afford OOP costs. \nA few weeks ago I had a severe dissociative episode. I found myself staring in the mirror for hours because it didn\u2019t look like me, instead of playing on my phone I\u2019d just stare at the ceiling, sounds weird but I felt like a floating head. My body didn\u2019t feel like it was there much less my own. I didn\u2019t feel the floor on my feet, I had to try and inflict pain on myself to see if the arm I was looking at was really part of me. \nThis gradually got better over 2-3 weeks. Then one day I woke up and felt amazing! No intrusive thoughts, energy to do things after work, no crying for a full 7 days! It was great. I was so happy and almost felt that life wasn\u2019t going to be completely miserable until I die. \nThen it all went away at the drop of a hat. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this before. I woke up this morning and was in a great mood. My husband and I got in a minor argument and now I\u2019m back to tears streaming down my face for no apparent reason. I just want to stay in my room away from everyone again. \nThat week was amazing. I\u2019m typically a functioning depressed person but these past 3 years I have to force myself to shower, I over eat constantly, I don\u2019t make plans with anyone. I\u2019m just a shell going to work and try not to alienate my family. So when I had that exceptionally bad episode where I also slacked at work and had difficulty interacting with my loved ones I honestly felt like I should not be here. Not kill myself but, just gone. I would love to have that week back. \nHas anyone gone through this?",

I would spend my day on a laptop doing my school for the duration of middle school and the world was my oyster. I met my father once and he gave me his toshiba laptop and a psp, and I would play this game called \"PlazmaBurst2\" while pretending to be a girl in-game for attention. I would wake up at around 7 and stay up till 3 or 4 every night watching anime and chatting with people on kongregate. This was my paradise, this was my escape from the constant yelling , screaming, and punishments from my mother who was in college and working at the same time. I was adopted into the internet and have slowly lost myself over the years.  I am now 20 years old and have absolutely nothing going on except a shitty part time job. \n\nSorry for the rant so far, that's just the origin to my story I guess.\n\nI've known somethings been wrong with me for a while, but a few weeks ago I took myself to the doctors about a cyst I had, we took care of it and then she asked me about my mental health. I talked to her for a while and she summarized that I have severe depression. She offered me medicine that would help (which I refused) and asked me to come in for blood work so she could check on it and see if everything is good.\n\nI feel guilty. Other people have more of a reason to be depressed then I do, and yet I now have this card stapled into my scalp stating that I have this disease. I'm terrified to try medicine as I am a hypochondriac and will think of everything that could go wrong. I feel like I don't deserve my life?

I go out for walks, for cycling (all by myself) to calm myself and get out of my bed and all I see are couples. Teen couples, couples in their 20s, adult couples. All sorts of friend groups.

Not particularly social, always had kind of shitty friends that dumped me in the end or behaved like assholes or were weirdos in general. I never feel like I fit with my surroundings, I seriously feel like I havent lived yet. Now I'm 18 and went through shit to get into a uni to study something hard I'm not sure at all I like, probably fucked up my decisions while feeling hopeless about the horrid job prospects in my country and in general.\n\nI know there are things I enjoy such as cooking, or hairdressing (but only as hobbies and it's a shame not to utilize my mental abilities into university studies, especially in such a competitive job market). I also like nature but I drifted away from it since I couldn't mentally handle chemistry or physics or anything like that anymore, even though I somewhat liked these too.\n\nEverything I do feels futile, I'm so miserable right now it's taking a toll on my loved ones mental health and I can't take it.. I can't even make decisions about the most unimportant small things in my life and every day is a decision-making hell because I over analyze the outcomes of my decisions and how it can affect my life. It has become pathological at this point and I feel severe guilt about spending money to the point I don't want to shower for too long, or eat too much, or spend on petrol or on clothes..\n\nI hate the fact that I'm ranting right now but I'm at a point in life where I feel so fucked up that I can't just say hey forget about it and go on with my day because it's the same dull routine of staying at home due to basically not having any friends, let alone the spiraling covid situation which is stressful enough...\n\nAnyway.. I would appreciate any advice, and sorry if I wasted your time I just can't take it anymore",

I don\u2019t know what or how my parents found out, but they did. Oh, I should mention I\u2019m a bisexual male. I already came out (my family is Catholic), and the reception has pretty much been pretending it didn\u2019t happen. We just don\u2019t talk about it. Anyways, they found out but didn\u2019t say anything to me, they just tightened restrictions without explanation, but it didn\u2019t stop my attempts. \n\nMarch 22nd, 2021, 3:30 AM: Two men enter my room while I\u2019m sleeping, wake me up, and tell me to pack up my things now. They tell me nothing. They immediately take my phone. It was either comply or be forced, so I simply complied and packed up my stuff. They put me in a van, and we drive away for about one hour and then I\u2019m dropped off at a \u201crehabilitation\u201d facility. No surprise, it was \u201cChrist-based\u201d.\n\nMarch 22-May 14th: I get lucky, I only have about a forty-five day stay. Most have ninety. I wont go into to too much detail, but it was conversion therapy. I left with no identity, having no idea who I am or want to be. I\u2019m harassed for my sexuality the entire time I\u2019m there, everyone is religious and they force it on us like its nobodies business. It\u2019s bad\n\nMay 14th-August 19th: I do nothing. I get a job at Chick-Fil-A where I am again, harassed. I\u2019ve done my best to reinvent myself because I was brainwashed into hating my old self but I can\u2019t do it. I am who I am. I still expect things to be different. I mean, I\u2019m no longer having any bad mental thoughts, I\u2019m not using substances, so why is it not getting better? Why? They said it would. School is about to start and I don\u2019t even know if people remember me because I\u2019m banned from communication with anyone outside of work and family.\n\nAugust 19th- School begins, and I naively expect it to be different. I was brainwashed into believing I was an addict and thats the root of my issues, so then I should be better now. I should make friends fast and fit in with the kids I\u2019ve always wanted to fit in with. But, I don\u2019t. No one talks to me. I\u2019m insecure, lonely, I have hair-pulling issues so I\u2019m insecure of my hair, and while I know I\u2019m bi, I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m bi.

She had been to a trip with her family, and it was the first time in a year that she got out (COVID). She had been quite depressed too during this time, and when she got out she felt better. \n\nShe told me that despite being quite down, she saw a pram with infant twins. One of them accidently hurt the other with his fist, and the hurt kid started crying. The kid who hit him immediately started carressing his sibling and tried to coax him, and they started smiling. She says that this showed her that there is still happiness in the world, and we should look around and use these small things to look past the negativity we had in the last year or so. I liked this story. I made it a point to look for good things.\n\nNext day, she broke up with me.\n\nAnd thats the thing with me. Some people get to see cute babies.

This stresses me out because I have never gotten good grades even if I try my hardest so it\u2019s gotten to the point where I don\u2019t try anymore. My grades are too bad and I feel like it\u2019s too late to fix them.   Since my grades have been so poor I feel like have no future ahead of me. The teachers have called me names like idiot, moron, worthless, and a failure. This took place at a private Christian school where people think nothing bad happens there. When I was there it was filled with bad influences. School got so stressful for me that I ran away from home and my parents ended up calling the police on me about this. I\u2019ve always felt like a failure because I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend and I have never really accomplished anything huge. I\u2019m not very shy but I\u2019m a very awkward person. There was this one girl at my school that I would talk to every day and I liked her for 3 years. I would go home and think about her all day. After 3 years I decided to make the decision to tell her I like her. After I did that she said she wanted to stay friends and I was fine with that. The next day I came to school her friends were making fun of me and she never talked to me since. After all these events happening I fell into depression and it has ruined my life. I lost all my friends because I don\u2019t even talk to anyone anymore. I have switched schools and it has just gotten me more stressed out and I don\u2019t see me making friends with anyone there because it\u2019s a very small school. I am now taking medicine for this depression I have and it seems to only make me feel worse. I don\u2019t know what to do about this anymore I sure hope I\u2019m not the only one facing stuff like this.",

I've moved out on my own some years ago, but my mind is still just as fucked up as it was when I was a kid. \n\nI was watching this video on YouTube about a death sentence culture in Asia (It was either Japan or China), and the way it works there is that you are locked up, but they won't tell you when the execution date is. It might be in 4 hours, or 15 years. That's exactly how my mental illness feels like for me. I know that some day my mental conditions will get too much, and then it will all be over. I'm sure you can guess what I mean by that. \n\nIt can be the tiniest thing that happens in my life, that will send me down a spiral of catasthrophizing, anxiety, fear that something will happen to me and just severe depression. I might have a good week or even good months, but eventually I will be back lying on my bed just shaking with uncontrollable fear and feeling that my life is fucked up beyond recovery, and the only way out is well, you know.\n\nThis has been going on for many many many years, and I am just wondering when it will get too much. It just feels destined to happen at one point. Like it HAS to happen, and it's meant to be that way. I honestly can't in my wildest dreams imagine me living to an old age, or even 20 more years.

My dad when it is just me and him together are mostly fine, but when we are with my older sister, he mocks me and makes jokes at my expense, and doesn't address me in any way unless it's to do one of those 2 things. It seems he has no respect for me. I understand I am his child but he never treats my older sister this way, because I feel he just respects her more or something? I don't know, but it's painful to see him treat her like an adult and me as just a useless child. I just don't understand what it is about my sister's presence that makes him feel he needs to treat me like this. \n\nMy older sister (23)  is generally fine when it's just me and her, but when we are around my mam or dad, she treats me horribly. She'll take something I told her in confidence and use it against me to make her seem better in my parents' eyes, (most recent eg, I was telling her how I wasn't vaccinated yet and that I was registering to do so, expressing to her how I was very nervous and she seemed to understand me completely. But when we were with my dad, she begins to say how disgraceful is it that I'm not vaccinated yet, simply bc she knows my dad will agree and then proceed to lecture me. And she also has to then remind him how she is vaccinated, because she has to be the perfect one always). It hurts me so much that it seems she's always trying to go out of her way to make me feel bad, pinning us against each other. I just want a normal sister relationship, I never do anything to intentionally hurt her, and I am always so nice to her. She also takes great joy in telling me when someone is unhappy with me. In her eyes, if any of my family members are having an issue with me, it's a win for her, and I just don't understand why.\n\nThis sort of behaviour makes it so hard for me to have a good relationship with my dad or sister, and this is only touching the surface of my problems with them. Because I am sensitive and quiet, they think they can treat me however they want. I wish I could stand up to them and tell them they can't treat me the way they do, but I am so quick to tears they would completely disregard me. \"you can't say Boo to her without making her cry\" my sister would always say. I can't stop crying from the pain my family cause me, it has sent me into numerous panic attacks and I can't take it anymore. \n\n\nJust needed to get that off my chest. X",

        "selftext": "There should be no excuse to not say to myself that \"I'm lesser than someone else\" or \"I don't deserve to feel attractive\". But if you've been trying to wake up every day as a normal human being and still feel like a broken houseguest, then perhaps an excuse would validate your reasons for not trying anymore in the future. Wouldn't it? How commonplace it is to pretend to be everything else but your own individual self. Your mind would try to feed others the same fantasy after fantasy... until it expires on a Monday. And you just want to float in silence.\n\nAlthough sound isn\u2019t present, I could almost hear those harsh judgements behind every squinting eye, focusing on my current appearance in public. Internal monologuing has become my new favorite past-time nowadays. And I find the most comfort just by teasing the idea of me being the CEO of my thoughts. That way I can selectively choose and sort out my feelings without the judgement of others over me. But, sometimes, the responsibility of bearing any burden because of poor judgement affects the way I view my role as an independent thinker. Like, I could use a somewhat close relationship with someone who could at least fit the bill as my mutual companion to my brand, which comprises subtle, yet constant shifts of emotional distress.\n\nSomeone who could also understand how my feelings work within the complicated market of my emotions. The thought of having anything like that makes me want to hug that special someone and cry tears of joy, but I\u2019m afraid that the same person whom I would entrust my feelings to, could have the intentions of possibly collecting those same tears of joy and plant them into their backyard. Because what better things do narcissists do, besides working on their toxic garden to show \u201cproof\u201d of their reputation as an \u201cunderstanding\u201d person. Personally, I don\u2019t think I could trust anyone with that much responsibility. What if I get too comfortable and end up falling for another distraction from reality \u2014 which would seem like a normal, everyday activity for the trickster \u2014 and become trapped inside an endless loop of empty promises and false hope?\n\nGaining a damaged heart after going through all of that doesn\u2019t quite sit well with me. Not one bit. Thus, my paranoia of forming relationships became a token of my emotional invalidity; because my mind, my body, and my soul have gone through so many changes and phases just to look good for others who couldn\u2019t care less about my efforts, let alone my entire existence \u2014 It has made me all so ill and numb. So why bother sharing my selfies on social media or to my family members or to anybody when this so-called \u201cpraise\u201d that I usually get, is objectively further from the truth and rooted in disbelief. My family would always give my looks the benefit of a doubt, but when it comes to society, showing empathy or sympathy to people like myself is too foreign for them. To them, It's either you're aesthetically nice to look at, or you're not. And because of my looks, this would also affect my chances in meeting new people or familiars in public.\n\nI\u2019m almost always on guard publicly in case my confidence gets tried and tested from both familiars and unfamiliars, just so they could see if I\u2019m mentally stable enough to hold my own ground without collapsing under pressure. It\u2019s both mentally and physically exhausting. Why do I have to constantly pretend that I\u2019m this leader type of fellow who is in total control of his emotions and is always oozing confidence through his pores wherever he goes? When in reality, I just want to feel totally free from wearing my masks \u2014 a central theme that I\u2019ve mentioned in my previous blog entry \u2014 and be me. Why can\u2019t I feel vulnerable for once and get some slack for what I am born with? Another example to verify my list of my many reasons why I continue to have issues trusting others' understanding of me as a person. Yeah, my hands aren\u2019t manly enough, my height isn\u2019t quite enough, and my face doesn\u2019t charm passers-by to turn their heads eagerly towards my direction.\n\nSure, if I was more aesthetically pleasing, then I wouldn\u2019t think so harshly of my outward appearance, maybe I would be more careful when deciding on what else to say to my critical self. But unfortunately \u2014 It is what it is. Compared to the obviously genetically superior humans on social media and in other social settings, I'm just fair enough to not be considered a threat to the human race; Although, I think the most dangerous and ugly beasts can come from within, rather on the surface. But in my case, my beast isn\u2019t a threat to anyone, only to those who can\u2019t welcome him nor me with warm and open arms. I think this beast residing In my soul, doesn\u2019t like showing off his looks to the human species, for the same reason that I\u2019ve mentioned earlier \u2014 fear of harsh judgement.\n\nNow, whenever I look in the mirror, I see an angsty beast, a broken soul, and a depressed guy with a 4/10 appearance in the looks department. I just think it\u2019s best to simply say that I don\u2019t deserve to feel attractive, just to avoid feeling encouraged to post pictures and videos of myself online, devaluing the entire internet in the process. I can\u2019t keep hurting myself like this by selling too-good-to-be-true lies to myself about my image \u2014 I just can\u2019t. My words are enough for now as an extension of my soul, and best of all, they don\u2019t give me anywhere near the amount of anxiety I always go through  whenever I upload visual content of my appearance online. So that\u2019s pretty neat. Slowly but surely, I wish to feel comfortable in my own skin and not feel disgusted by every photo of me inside of my phone\u2019s gallery. I can\u2019t wait for that day to come. But until then \u2014 words for now.",

I drove 12 hours to Orlando to meet him because nobody wants to die alone. \n\nWhen I got there him and I met in a hotel to discuss our plans. His plan ended up being more shoddy then what I was comfortable with - he wanted us to go into the woods and press our heads next to each other while I pulled the trigger. \n\nHe was clear that I had to be the one to pull the trigger. Even though I think I *might* have been able to, I don\u2019t know probably not. And there was the risk of my bone fragments piercing his brain but not killing him, leaving him suffering. \n\nI thought our plan was to go by carbon monoxide poisoning in the hotel room- that\u2019s the most peaceful way I found. That\u2019s why I got a portable grill and a bag of charcoal but noo once I got there he said he wasn\u2019t comfortable with that method. Get this, because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to vomit\u201d since that method can make you nauseous. He also didn\u2019t want anyone to find our bodies and I agreed with him there. \n\n I told him I would hang out in the city until we got our plan straight. I ended up staying there for 2 months and came back home. No one know that\u2019s why I went to Florida lol! I still think about him and wonder if he took his exit peacefully. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about suicide again and just wanna go. Each time I come to an attempt it feels more final. I think until one day I succeed or quit caring about painless methods. \n\nIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m halfway through my 20\u2019s now and have been in pain for most of my life. This life never did fit me right. I feel inhuman. I have the lowest self esteem. It\u2019s weird to know you\u2019re somewhat attractive and in the same breath have such a low sense of worth.   I\u2019m fucking weird. Thanks for ruining my childhood to my fucking sick evil and sadistic mother. I honestly wish she could die first because the thought of living that vile woman on this earth doesn\u2019t sit right. \u201cIf you want to destroy someone then destroy her childhood and the rest will follow\u201d.\n\nI promised my cousin 5,000 to help him get started with stock trading.

        "selftext": "I wanted some kind of an anonymous outlet to just explore my mind and all the years of pent up chaos and anger. I was born to a raging heroin addict and a manic bi polar alcoholic as well as many drug addictions who used prostitution for income. By the time I was 1, my father had overdosed and died and my mother was well on her way to her own spiral. My mother was an adopted baby and she spent years trying to find her own family only to realize they wanted nothing to do with her. By the time I was 7 - I was mouth fucked by a pistol in a home invasion. watching my mom OD and get fucked for money became the norm. The night before second grade I was beatin unconscious by my older brother and was woke up by a police baton pushing against my head. Children an youth then searched endlessly for family but all they could find were the people that adopted my mom. So I was then sent to  live with two elderly people in their late 70s. I was a very gifted student with a 143 IQ and straight As effortlessly all through school. I was a great athlete and was well liked by my all my peers. My mom then followed us to this other state as you could imagine she had nothing left to live for. With her partner being gone and her kids being taken from her. The irony in her having a masters in social work. Anyways, she would go on to call all through the night and leave voicemails until the answering machine was full. Every night. Fuck you and the fucking horse you rode in on. I cant wait to piss on your grave etc. I never really felt love but I definitely knew abandonment and I was stripped of my innocence to the world very early around 6-7. By 8th grade I was hustling heady weed to save up so I could leave this situation at my \u2018grandparents\u2019 Highschool came and I decided to take things to the next level. I got a cross country connection and before you know it I was selling 60-100 pounds every 2 weeks. I had my own place by 15 and I was doing \u201cgood\u201d 6 days after I turned 18. My house was home invaded by 3 guys with no masks and guns. It was set up my brother. My only flesh and blood on this planet that was left. I didnt think id make it out of there alive to be completely honest but I did. So I moved across the country to try and start fresh and get away from all the toxicity. I forgot to mention that in 8th grade I came home to my grandparents to find my good friend at the times mom raiding my room. She knew my situation and always promised me Id always have a second mom in her. That lasted for about 2 years (Lol) and then she wanted nothing to do with me as well for everything that came with me. My moms harassment when shed drink on pills is second to none. etc. So after getting two jobs washing dishes for about 2 years I was starting to find normalcy. Then I got a call from my grandfather that officers in plain clothes had an indictment with my name on it along with 12 others but only 4 of the names I recognized. I was being charged with corrupt organization and a conspiracy of 1000+ lbs . I was extradited back across the country to serve my jail time and parole. So I did that. I dont have time to continue to type all the details of bad relationships of being cheated on, or how my last girlfriend wanted to get pregnant aborted my child not once but twice. Which felt sadistic but I wont go there. I will skip over a ton of relationships of me always being there for people but no body ever being there for me because I grew up alone. Always relied on myself. But still here I am trying to push to change this generational curse. Yes my actions did not help my situation but I was a fucking kid trying to make ends meet. Hold down school and my apartment and bills. Now Im a 27 year old felon who has never made more than 13 dollars an hour and every business I try fails miserably. I taught myself a hern stack in software dev and I wanted to blow my head off even more. I ran social accounts for cpc click rates. Ive ran e commerce stores before it was overly saturated. None of it makes me happy. And now here I am about to turn 28 and I live in the fuckin ghetto have little to no money and absolutely NO idea what to do with my life. I hate everything. I have terrible trust issues after all the bad relationships and terrible experiences with women in my past. All of my \u201cfriends\u201d gang raped my girlfriend that I actually loved and filmed it and sent it all around. I just dont know how to keep on keepin on. Every job I can get is absolutely horrid and I cant hold it down for more than 6 months because the pay is never equal to my ability and they know theyre getting great labor because im a felon and they hold it over my head. I just need some one or something to give me a fucking break. My whole life teachers fought for me to be in their classes and the thing that haunts me is they all would say \u201cim not worried about you, youre smart youll figure it out.\u201d Well so was my mom and my dad, they were both brilliant except my dad overdosed and my mom is still fucking and sucking for ends meet at 63. I just wanted to get some of my trauma off my chest. I left out many details and even more fucked up shit but I dont even care. Maybe some one will understand, maybe they wont. Who cares",

Good job, married, ok finances, some good friends, a Ph.D.  Major Depressive Disorder for years, anxiety and social anxiety, some trichotillomania.  On Wellbutrin 300 mg a day.  By most accounts, I should be happy.  But I'm empty.  Where there should be emotions, it's largely emptiness. I don't like being alive, but I've made commitments to some people to stay alive for at least the next few years. I see a therapist and a psychiatrist.\n\nFor lack of a better term, I created a mask for myself a long time ago, and I became really skilled in wearing it.  I rarely let it slip.  I'm more \"mask\" than \"me\" at this point.  It's a pretty good mask, too.  Funny, insightful, good at listening to others. But it's exhausting to maintain.\n\nI'm tired. Just so very, very tired.  I'm committed to continue being alive and functioning as best I can, but on a fundamental level I feel like I'm just waiting for the end to finally come.  And the end feels really far away.\n\nI have dreams where people are trying to kill me, and part of me puts up a fight but that voice in my head tells me this is it, my way out is here.  Then I wake up, resigned to do it all again.\n\nAnyway, that's where my head is at.  Thanks for reading.",

I was accepted to a college I was so excited about &amp; my life was finally back on track. About two weeks ago she came back into my life telling me she hasn\u2019t been happy without me. She proceeded to say everything I wanted to hear from not giving up ever again to how much I mean to her. Yesterday she told me she doesn\u2019t have feelings for me &amp; basically left like I was nothing. I fell in love all over again &amp; I hate myself for forgiving her &amp; trusting her. I feel so lonely and abandoned. I was broken before but this time I\u2019m broken all over again &amp; even worse. Having such happiness &amp; hope again all to be taken away is going to be then end of me because I truly did love &amp; care about that girl. And now I\u2019m battling my pain to stay alive but I\u2019m losing so much ground with each hour that passes. It\u2019s destroyed me as a person, I use to feel so strong &amp; now I\u2019m a pathetic mess. I once gave her everything I could in order to make her life better. I stayed here instead of going off to college. I\u2019ve sacrificed and lost so much for her. I can\u2019t stop thinking about why I wasn\u2019t enough. I don\u2019t think she realizes or even cares about how traumatic this is for me. I wish so dearly that she would care like she used to. I believe if we never met I would have been able to live a long happy life but this breaks me back down into feeling like I\u2019m nothing, I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m not worth anything again. Everything else about my life is beautiful, I love my family so much &amp; I have so many hobbies that I have so much fun doing. I was just unlucky enough to end up loving the wrong person. &amp; I\u2019m not ready for a new cycle of suffering.

I just need you all to know my heart was too big &amp; when it broke, I broke &amp; I will never be the same again. I don\u2019t deserve to live a life of depression &amp; heartbreak.

        "selftext": "I deserve to be alone. In high school and college I was too shy and too anal about my studies, and now I have nothing to show for it. I don't have a job and I can't even remember half of what I learned (not that it's that useful anyway unless I go to law school or some shit, which I'm not even sure I want to do). It's probably too late to find someone now since I'm almost 23 and have never even been on a date before. I also suck at maintaining friendships because I don't feel like starting a conversation unless I think I have a reason to. Besides, most of the time my friends don't check up on me anyway.\n\nI deserve to be broken. I could've actually put effort into the therapy I went to for three years and tried to become a better person, but instead I kept looking for things to be mad about. I was so used to being angry that I enjoyed it. Now my mom won't pay for therapy anymore because she says it won't work, and she's probably right. But instead she made me do these bullshit mindfulness exercises that didn't work, and when I stopped doing them she just said I hadn't been doing it for long enough. I just wish I had someone to talk to. Except I'm not even sure I want that, because every time I try to talk to someone on here I just let the conversation peter out because I don't have the energy to keep it going, and I feel better the more time I stay off of social media. I just come here because I feel like I have nowhere else to go.\n\nI'm so done with this fucked up world and I can't live with myself anymore. If I don't find a job by the time I turn 23 I'll probably drink myself to death. I'm probably setting myself up because I don't look hard enough, but I don't even know what I want to do. For the last 13 years of my life I've been fucking miserable. At least let me die happy. I don't even know why I'm bothering to write this. I guess it's like a journal and part of me hopes that someone will see it like the pathetic attention-seeking loser I am.",

So I didn't reply to them and later apologized with the excuse of having bad wifi.\n\nThese two people are really nice, are really social and on top of all they are part of a big friend group.

        "selftext": "In August 2019, I was arrested for DWI (I blew a .09, legal limit is .08). It's my first and only time ever getting arrested. Since that day, I have lived in a constant state of anxiety and depression. You see, I'm an immigrant in America. I could be deported if convicted. That's not the part that gives me anxiety, however. The part that's killing me is the waiting game. My case is still in process after TWO years. My lawyer told me this stupid pandemic has slowed the courts down to a halt. I lost my ability to work legally in April and I can't apply for another work permit until this case is resolved. So I haven't worked in 5 months. Now I just sit at home, waiting on my lawyer to call me to tell me my case has been resolved. But I have a feeling it won't resolve for a very long time because apparently courts can't function during covid. It appears I have three options: \n\n1) Say \"fuck it all \" and just move back to my native country. I haven't been there in 25 years but I suppose it would be a fresh start. I would hate it though because I consider the US my home.\n\n2) Stay and fight the case. This is what I've been doing but it kills me because I don't see an end in sight with anti-vaxxers prolonging this fucking pandemic.\n\n3) Kill myself. It would devastate my family, but at least I would no longer feel like I'm stuck in a state of limbo with no direction or purpose. It kills me figuratively that I can't even earn a living so I might as well kill myself literally.\n\nLiterally no one gives a shit about covid where I live so it irks me to no end that the courts do. I think the worst part is that felonies are being processed by the courts here while misdemeanors like mine are being put on hold with complete disregard to how that impacts people's life. I understand I made a mistake. I put myself in this situation. There's not a day that goes by that I wish I could take it back. But seriously, convict me or dismiss the fucking case already or I might do something harsh.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 24 (M) and I have felt depressed for many years and right now I\u2019m at my lowest, Unemployed, Epilepsy and a shit Memory\n\n. I recently moved to London in November to start a new job and hopefully a new life. The job wasn\u2019t for me and the people I worked for were very unsupportive and harsh. This lead to me being let go at the end of December during which time I had Covid. \n\nThe first house I moved into was a warehouse that was cold, depressing and dirty. I lived with three other girls who I wouldn\u2019t see much. Everyday I would go to work, come home and sit in my room watching TV until I went to sleep. The only people I saw were my work colleagues which most probably lead to being unprofessional at work. \n\nFor two weeks I had a noose tied to my bed frame made from a long extension lead\u2026 I guess this was just a way of me letting myself know that there was a way out if I needed it.\n\nI have just moved house again which is actually a very pleasant household but being unemployed along with my depression has made it hard to motivate myself.\n\nI think my depression stemmed from my parents break up which lasted from 11-14. I am the oldest of three, my other two siblings went through this as well but I feel as though I took the brunt of it. After years of unrest and a bad relationship with my mum. She was and still is a hoarder and dealing with this made me feel very unstable, which lead to me being a disruptive and rebellious teenager.\n\nI then moved out and lived with my dad in a flat. At first it was good but he then started another emotionally abusive relationship which I was again in the middle of. I then moved out and lived with my grandparents for a bit which was a better environment but I felt very isolated.\n\nAt the same time as all of the problems at home I was being bullied at school\u2026 I think the majority of it was banter but due to the stresses of home I was very emotional which made me an easy target. \n\nDuring year 9 aged 14 I moved schools to get away from the bullying. This was good but an hour commute there and back was tiring. The change in school was a good move as I wasn\u2019t being bullied anymore. \n\nAfter a few months at my grandparents I moved back in with my mum as my dad had left and moved to Stoke on-trent\u2026 again this was hard as I had a lot of resentment towards her and her inability to sort the house out. I know she loves me but as a person she finds it hard to express her emotions so I was never told by her that she loved me or shown any physical affection. \n\nWhen I reached 18 and with terrible grades I managed to convince a local university to take me on and I moved out into student accommodation. \n\nThe three years spent at university was probably some of the best I\u2019ve had, although I was drinking excessively which certainly didn\u2019t help towards my mental health. \n\nUniversity finished and from there I moved in with my aunt and uncle until I found a job and a shared house to move into. Living with them was amazing, it was a taste of what a real family environment should be like and being there finally made me feel at home.\n\nI finally found a job working in events for a company that ran events, owned a venue and held a festival so I moved out. I was their Events Manager and Head of Decor for their festival. At the same time I worked as an artist manager and tour manager for several artists.\n\n2019 was an amazing year but running weekly events and 8 festivals took their toll. I was drinking most nights and doing drugs constantly at all events I ran. During this time I was having blackouts and memory loss during the day, suddenly I was in the office and then I was outside and I had no recollection of walking out\u2026\n\nAt the end of the summer after a 3 day bender I had a grand mal seizure. After speaking to the doctors they concluded that I had been having partial seizures all summer and at least two a day.\n\nSuddenly I had epilepsy, my driving licence revoked and thrown into an even deeper pit of depression.\n\nAll my life I have had intrusive thoughts and a voice in my head constantly telling me to kill myself. After talking to a therapist she concluded that I had OCD.\n\nHere is a note I wrote during 2020\n\n*\u201cI feel so alone and it\u2019s probably due to my epilepsy along with a few other things\u2026* \n\n*I feel like no one checks up on me especially my own family (apart from one friend), I look back through texts and it seems to be only me contacting them first and if it\u2019s not it\u2019s normally to ask me for something or to talk about stuff relating to future plans. Which is ok but I just wish people would ask me how I am.* \n\n*I have been using alcohol and drugs as an escape even though I know they increase my chances of seizures. I tell my friends that it\u2019s ok and that I am fine to take certain ones but I know deep down they\u2019re all bad for me. I constantly say I\u2019m going to quit stuff but I don\u2019t and feel like I\u2019m in a constant loop of self destruction.*\n\n*I live in the same city I grew up in and went to uni in which makes me upset as I want to leave but I haven\u2019t sat down and had the motivation to do it. I don\u2019t know if this is because I feel down or I want to be self destructive?* \n\n*I live in a shared house where everyone seems to be against one another which is hard as I feel like I\u2019m stepping on eggshells constantly.* \n\n*I don\u2019t have a permanent home where I can go back to for a night or even for dinner with family because my mum is a hoarder so won\u2019t let me. The house also brings back awful memories and stresses me out if I go there, especially the state it is in now. My dad lives in Stoke on Trent and thinks that if I have a night at his I will argue.* \n\n*I haven\u2019t spent any proper time with my close family for years and I don\u2019t think that will ever change.*\n\n*I feel like I can\u2019t read a room or a situation and always overstep the mark\u2026 it\u2019s only when I lose friends or get ignored by them do I realise I\u2019ve done something wrong.*\n\n*I\u2019m looking for a way out and I constantly tell myself to kill myself, both out loud and in my head. I know this isn\u2019t the solution and would ruin my family.* \n\n*The one person I hate the most is myself and I\u2019d do anything to get rid of him.\u201d*\n\nHere is another - just of a few intrusions I wrote down\n\n* *23rd December 2020 - standing the shower wanting to kill myself over stupid thoughts... I got really drunk the night before so probably doesn\u2019t help*\n* *24th - calling myself a twat and wanting to kill myself whilst in the shower, physical cringe*\n\n*\"You have until the end of January to sort this out otherwise you need to end it.\"*\n\nI worked from home for 18 months during the pandemic and that only made things worse.\n\nAfter a long period of stagnation in my life and career I decided to move to London thinking that moving away would sort out my problems.. They have only followed me and have most probably gotten worse because of it.\n\nI have missed out a lot of problems and periods in my life but I think these are my main ones. \n\nI feel very hopeless right now and am on the edge of suicide. I sort of wanted to post this as a way of expressing my feelings and potentially a way to heal myself. Above all this could be my note.",

This was created on mobile.\n\n---\n\nIt's a beautiful autumn afternoon. The sun is shining, the leaves are a cascade of the usual fall colors, and there's that slight chill in the air that serves as a gentle reminder that winter is indeed coming. You're laying on the couch, having enjoyed a lazy day off from life's many obligations, but now you can't help but count the seconds on the clock as they tick away. It's agonizing and you know it, but still you can't help yourself as your anticipation builds. The time you're waiting for is getting closer\u2026 and closer\u2026 \n\nThen you hear the sound of a key in the front door and your ears prick up. The door is pushed open and your heart leaps just as your body does. The love of your life has finally returned after a day that was beginning to feel like it would never end. You crash into each other and both squeeze so hard, you wouldn't be surprised if you pop like one of those stress relief dummies. The hug has probably gone on long enough, but you refuse to let go partially afraid that they might disappear if you aren't holding them. You fight back tears of joy because even though you never thought it was possible, you just know they feel the same way about you.\n\nFinally you pull back just enough in order to kiss them softly, conveying more thoughts and feelings and sheer love for them than words ever could. After a few seconds you let up, unable to fight it any longer. A single rogue tear finally escapes and rolls free down your face. Your heart soars as you see your partner smile, struggling to hold back tears of their own. They were just as enthusiastic to see you. Another tear threatens to escape your confines. \"Don't cry baby, you're gonna make me cry too,'' they say, wiping the tears that had escaped your defenses away. You hold hands and look lovingly into each other's eyes, baring your souls for one another. The two of you weren't normally this sappy, but it seemed to just be one of those days, and damn it, you were glad it was. \n\n\"I couldn't wait for you to get home,\" you tell them, pulling them down to the couch. The two of you shift into your natural cuddling position as you have so many times before. You both sigh and lay there in silence for a while. Eventually, time would demand you get up and do things, but you knew if you had the option, you could lay there with your soul mate for eternity, and be in a state of bliss the entire time. \n\n\"I'm so lucky to have you,\" you say softly, breaching the comfort of silence. \"If I had to do it all over, I'd gladly go through all the heartache again. Because it led me to you; and there's no one else I'd rather give my heart to in the whole wide world,\" they say lovingly. \"I love you,\" you say. \"I love you too,\" they respond. You both adjust and lightly kiss each other again. \n\n\"I am getting hungry however, so how about we make something?\" They suggest. \"That sounds great,\" you reply, entirely on board with the idea. Regardless if you were good at it or not, making something together was a great way to spend time with each other, and that's the only thing you wanted to do after your time apart. \"What should we make, Chicken?\" They ask. \"Not feeling that, Pasta?\" You counter. \"We just had that last night. Oh, I know! How about we be naughty and have cookies for dinner,\" they say, eyebrows raised. You chuckle and boop them on the nose. Just another example of why you love them with all your heart. \"Alright, it's a plan, but I get to use the cookie cutter this time,\" you say as you both get up. \"Nah, first one there gets that honor loser!\" They say, laughing as they sprint into the kitchen. \n\nYou smile and think back to all the days and nights where the loneliness seemed to be too much. You had some dark thoughts those days. Sometimes the darkest one of all. You never thought in a million years you'd find someone who would actually love you as you did them. You were glad you persevered even when you didn't know why you kept going. You thought back to what they had said earlier as you followed them into the kitchen. If you had to do it all again, you gladly would. Because it led you to them, and there was no one you'd rather share your heart with in the whole wide world.\n\n---\n\nEven though it doesn't seem like it will ever happen, it is possible. I'm in the same boat as you. Just keep going and keep trying new things, even if you don't know why you're still fighting. You never know when your life will change for the better.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s physically possible for me to continue living anymore. \n\nFor the past 2 years I\u2019ve been studying full-time while caring for/ basically parenting my partner who has BPD. She was only medicated and diagnosed recently but my mental health has suffered so much. Of course I did it out of genuine love but right now I am having a hard time feeling like anybody loves or appreciates me. \n\nI\u2019m the one who cleans the dishes. I\u2019m the one who cooks. I do the laundry. I do the groceries. I have been paying for everything except her half of the rent, this entire year. I drained my savings. But I understand. She couldn\u2019t find a job due to the lockdowns, and she always talked about feeling guilty. I guess right now, I\u2019m just at my breaking point. I\u2019m exhausted after being her therapist and parent for this entire time. I need to remind her to eat, brush her teeth, shower, take her meds, call dr for her prescription etc. I\u2019m tired from not receiving much back for the hours, days, months of time I have devoted in order to keep her alive and well. I\u2019m also tired and hurt that I\u2019ve been forced into this role as her caregiver over time. Feels more like I\u2019m just here to do everything for her rather than a romantic relationship.\n\nA huge thing at the moment is the fact that I\u2019m unemployed (due to my previous job rostering me 3 hours per week out of nowhere) I\u2019ve applied for 80+ jobs beginning on 10 December and I still haven\u2019t been hired anywhere. I even applied for shit like mcdonalds, man. Somehow, I just keep failing in everything I do. I just want a job, so that I can afford to live. But at this point, it seems like that wont be possible.\n\nRegardless of what I do, I\u2019ll never be able to change the fact that I come from an impoverished family and that I will remain impoverished for most or all of my life. The health issues, lack of generational wealth, psychological illness and trauma I have endured as a result of being an impoverished child has cemented my future. \n\nI mean, look at me. I haven\u2019t been able to make myself a meal in weeks. I simply cant afford anything that isn\u2019t processed food, if I can afford anything at all. My parents income is still below the poverty line, my dad is sick with something life threatening so yeah absolutely no financial support there.\n\nI\u2019m fucked. I\u2019m so fucking stupid for believing I could change the trajectory of my life by going to university. If only I had ended my life before enrolling, it wouldve saved me 2 years of intensive study and student debt. Because, being real, there\u2019s no way out for me. I still need to sort out a new flat as my lease ends next month, i dont have the money to pay a bond because im fucking unemployed and there is nobody in my life who supports me financially. the most i can buy right now is a loaf of bread.\n\nCan\u2019t get government support as I\u2019m a student and can only receive money while studying. My semester begins march 1.\n\nSo, here I am. I\u2019ve done everything and more to try live a normal life, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Saving money since I was employed at age 13 wasn\u2019t enough. I\u2019m 19 now. Working during full-time study wasn\u2019t enough. Nothing I do will ever be enough. I will always be poor, I\u2019ll always be starving, I\u2019ll always be 1 inconvenience away from a panic attack because none of my basic needs are being met, I\u2019m too busy stressing about whether or not I need to resort to prostitution in order to survive.\n\nI just want to live. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever lived, not in my entire life.",

My parents divorced when I was in second grade. I didn't understand it until 4th grade. I started crying every night and soon developed a self hate. From the divorce to now we have struggled with money. I can't help but give myself self hatred. I hate my body. I hate my personality. I hate myself. I stopped caring about myself. By 6th grade I was cutting my arms and had lost eveything good. Things just kept going downhill. I lately learned I have ADD (been tested), possible OCD, and anxiety (with anxiety attacks) . I have scars on my arms, I body shame myself in the mirror. I have no motivation and I can barely get up in the mornnings. People make me feel horrible when I get called \"lazy\" or that I can't do anything right. And it's true. If I'm being honest with you on this, I am in 7th grade. I'm hated for my sexaulity and I'm down to one real friend. I am suicidal and almost attempted and yet I cant help but wonder if all this was just an idea put in my head. I have constantly been forgotten about. My mom is an alcoholic and gambling addict who has two DUIs and can't save her money. She spent all of the birthday money my sister and I had (about 600 all together). I'm so tired of suffering, but is it not an actual mental illness? Am I putting this idea in my head?

I switched jobs in September to another clinic to get out of a toxic work environment. After I started there thinking that it was going to be great even though I took a pay cut, it went down hill quick. Micromanagement and wanting people to go home early, I wasn't making ends meet. In December I asked one of the receptionist at work out, thought that was going to be a good thing since I was already looking for a new job, well right after getting together with her my mental health tanked so hard and I have not recovered, maybe trauma from my last relationship I don't know. I got a job in construction right before Christmas thinking that old help since I would be out of the veterinary field (highest civilian suicide rate). It's true I had a close call right before I got my new job. Along side that in my personal life I have an alcoholic dad that got DUI (hasn't gone to court yet) and makes my home life hell, a close family member passed  right after Christmas and had an ER visit with my mother. I've tried everything medication and exercise. But I myself have a drinking problem since it's the only way I can go to sleep. A lot of little stuff has happened since then too and it just has added up so much with nothing good happening in return. I'm honestly at my breaking point, I've had the bad thoughts everyday since the beginning of December and broken down when I'm alone more than I've done in years. I'm losing my mind, I over think so much, replay so much, play the what if game so much. I don't feel anything but sadness and hopelessness now, everyday is a fight and I'm losing it quickly. I'm supposed to talk to my old therapist tomorrow and get an evaluation by a psychiatrist next week. I don't have much hope.",

But I can never come to terms with the idea that my company can be enjoyable, much less preferable. I instead view my company in regards to tolerance. I conceptualize friends as people that tolerate me and offer pleasantries and courtesies through some sort of prolonged charitable gesture. I conceptualize romance as a ploy to wring from me what precious little benefits I can provide. I don't believe a person can be genuinely interested in me, instead pleasant interaction is simply pity, charity, or manipulation in disguise. \n\nThe opinion that I hold of myself is terrible. My base assumption is that I deserve every terrible thing that happens to me and that any pleasant experience must be earned through hardship, pain, and/or misery. \n\nI've had crippling depression for years now. I hardly function. Often times I wonder if I deserve to be alive. In fact, one of the primary reasons I try to function at all is to spare myself from discomfort and boredom. \n\nSometimes my anxiety gets the better of me and one of the ways I calm myself is by thinking of dying. I've had that coping mechanism since I was a child. I used to think \"If I die everything will be better. Any problems I cause, any discomfort or hardship brought on by my existence will just go away once I'm gone. Everyone will be happy and I won't have to worry about anything anymore.\"\n\nOf course, now I know better.

In fact, I don't think I have many friends left, other  than her.\n\nShe probably doesn't  know her friend told me; although I've seen some signs, I don't know if  she likes me too.

Never really understood how somebody could just not be happy but I think I\u2019m at that point. 19m, I have had a good life, parents divorced when I was 3, dad and got custody ,he remarried when I was 7. Don\u2019t talk to my biological mother because she just wasn\u2019t a good mother to me or my siblings. Never had a problem with anything until high school. Met a girl in my sophomore year of high school, we dated for the better part of 2 1/2 years. I\u2019ve always been the romantic type and it was no different, I loved her with all I had until I started hanging out with the wrong crowd. They kept saying it would never last because we had never had sex, she wanted to wait until marriage but we were active in other ways. Eventually I got consumed with it and started pushing it with her, I lost touch with my romantic side and all I cared about was how many bases I hit. I never pushed it too far but it got to a point where I ruined the relationship. She broke up with me when we graduated high school. Man, that fucked me up. I called her everyday for a week telling her I would fix my shit and get it together but she had already moved on. I used to be confidant and a happy go lucky guy and now I\u2019m timid and have no confidence. Everything just feels numb and out of touch. I have a good job and a great career ahead of me, a good friend group and family. But it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s been almost 2 years now since we broke up. I\u2019ve gotten with one girl and ended it shortly after, I just knew she wasn\u2019t for me. It bugs me that I have so much to be grateful for but none of it makes me happy. I just don\u2019t really know what to do. She followed me on insta a week ago which is why I guess this is all coming up.  At first I thought it was normal but it\u2019s been so long now.

And for 3 months I stayed away but I always kept our means of communication open. I always answered them when they did check in. I heard many things lately that made me go back. \n\nI reached out to one of them a few days ago and asked if it was possible to mend our friendship.

Obviously as a kid, i didn't know any better and thought it was normal to have an overwhelming weekly schedule of random clubs, unnecessary tuitions and revision sessions with my dad that would just end up with him losing his temper and hitting me until i got the answer right. i just battled through it bcos its what my parents expected of me so of course its what i had to do.\n\nwhen i was 11, i got into the academically best high school for girls in the country after doing entrance exams (in the uk, there are grammar schools which are basically selective schools that require you to do exams and then they select the top 150 candidates or so depending on the school). while i thought that was the best thing that happened to me since thats all my parents wanted from me at the time, thats where everything went to shit for me, from my already shitty mental health to me literally having no idea what the point of my life was.\n\n**Okay, read from here:**\n\nHigh school made me realise that i had no idea who i was and what MY goals were, not what my parents wanted me to do. i don't know why it took me so long to realise that the reason i felt like i had no passions or interests of my own was because my parents never allowed me to enjoy the things i was doing because everything they ever made me do was so that i could get into the best university and so my whole life has been about doing the best at everything, from winning sport competitions to getting the top grade in all the music and drama exams to getting random awards and certificates just so that i had the best \"uni cv\" i could possibly have. my parents along with the toxically competitive environment of my school just made me so stressed all the time about doing well that i lost all motivation to study or pursue anything i thought i had an interest in and instead immediately dismissed it as\"stupid\" bcos it wasn't something deemed \"impressive\" or \"realistic\" in the eyes of my parents. They influenced my brain so much that i didn't even feel like i could like something that didn't seem good enough to them.\n\ni never got to really experience the enjoyment of my extracurriculars, or even my teenhood for that matter bcos of all the stress i was under. i barely every hung out with my friends and when i didn't have to go to clubs or tuitions i would just be locked up in my room doing revision and homework, although towards the end i was just completely burnt out and could barely have the energy to do anything. Never had time to deal with any of the mental shit i was going through or maybe i just didn't want to cos it was too complicated i don't even know...\n\nSo here i am now, doing physics at a university my parents aren't too happy about (even though its top 15 in the uk), and thinking about what i would've chosen to do if my life didn't turn out the way it did, if i lived a different, more free life with parents who are open and accepting of however their kid wants to live their life.\n\nrecently, i keep thinking about how i would've chosen to explore the arts more. even though i went to singing lessons, piano lessons, speech and drama etc, i never enjoyed it because i was forced into doing them from the start and it was more so about doing it for the sake of my future rather than just as a hobby or an enjoyable free-time activity as im sure its meant to be for most people who choose to do them. ive always been a music addict, i listen to music all the time and its kinda what got me through life so far as dramatic as it sounds. i think i like singing and ive been told a couple times in the past that im good at it but ive always had a very low self-esteem and have trouble convincing myself im good at something even when other people point it out for me, i can't seem to see it for myself. thing is im rly rly shy and have bad anxiety so i can't sing in front of other people and i only do it when i know for sure im alone, its kinda the only time i can practise. i also have tried using software to produce music and make mashups of songs which i rly enjoy doing, i also rly like tv shows and the process of making one - producing and writing is something i find so interesting and even acting is something i think i would enjoy but i dont know i feel like ive missed out on figuring out what im actually good at and being able to actually choose to do something that would make me happy - i dont even know what will truly make me happy which is why i just want to start over in a different life.\n\nim sorry if it seems like im being way too dramatic, i honestly feel like its stupid for me to feel like this but its something ive just wanted to get out of my system for a while now so yeah... :/\n\nalso sorry if stuff doesn't make sense, i kinda got carried away and forgot spelling and grammar exists",

(i was very late with growing up in sexual things.. i guess because my mother always had a thing for bad guys and they kreeped always on me) \nSo my twin i and his friend where running in a appartment building then his friend wanted to talk to him.. so they came togheter to me and sayd.. so you have a relationship for a few weeks now.. so you have a chooce.. or he may tought you wherevery he wanted of you need to tounge kiss.. i dindt wanted anything of that.. so i sayd i dindt want it.. he keeps saying i needed to.. so after a long time argruing i dindt take it anymore so i run home to my mom  crying.. \nwhen he came back and saw me crying he didnt give a damn.. \nthe same year whe did go to group 8 of school so that means there are coming a whole new class to our school (we where group 8a and they group 8b)\nI dindt had friends and this was my change to make new one that dindt know anything about me.. so i made a few.. i was so happy.. till one day he told everyone that i was the favorite kid at home and that i was a terrible person.. so everyone hated me for that.. (one friend stick with me but all the other ones leaved) \n(And actually he was always the favorite of my mom and grandmom.. i only was the favorite for all my stephfathers but i wasnt happy about that either) \nWe did go to the first grade and then i made friend very well.. but every fucking friend i made he did something sexualy that they don\u2019t want so when i choose him every one leaves me.. every time i made a new friend this happend.. \n\nSo now the real deal.. \n\nMy twin always walked in the middle of the night when i was sleeping with my friend.. (all of them where saying this and i waked up from it one time so i know they dont lie to me) \nWhen we where 17 we became really close because he let me smoke weed and i changed in a much better person.. \nHe was the best friend i ever had.. i mean whe where exactly alike and had made a friend group of his friends and my 1 friend.. and he helped me with my depression.. so because of him and the friendgroup i was doing a lot of drugs.. (weed and drugs make you see things trough that you never know before) \nSo i really fell in love this time with one of our group.. (age 18) \nI was so in love and my twin feld like i replaced him..\nSo one day me and my boyfriend where home alone.. so i guess you know what that means.. because we where home alone i made a loud noise.. but then my twin just walked in..  \nmy boyfriend looks him right in the eyes and saw that he saw everything.. \nmy twin sayd he dindt see anything.. ( what he always sayd when he walked in when i was chaning clothes) \n\nSo after that and that he was saying stuff to break me and my boyfriend appart and creappy stuff like he thinks my scream while sex is fun and much more stuff like that.. \nme and my boyfriend were talking togeter about this and bacause we both knew him so well in different kinda relationships we came to the conclusion off this whole story.. (i always thought he is my twin and dindt mean it that way) \nSo now we find out everything we wanted to comfirm him with this.. \nhe was going crazy like rolling around the flour (he was doing a lot off drugs) \nHe said non of it s true and i needed therapy.. \n(I was kicked out my house and moved in to my mothers house that is a really nasty mess because she used it as a warehouse) \nSo we he did go back to my old home and i didt see him anymore for i while.. then my mother was losing the house so i moved in to my boyfriend parents house for a half a year.. then i missed my own place and stuff so i asked to my father if i can come home again.. he was okay with it but my twin already had my room so i only got a bed in my twin his (chill room for his friends on the attic) \nI had no privacy because his friends where always over so i was with them.. \ni begin to forget about everything my twin did and we were beginning to be friends again.. \nthen he was doing weird again and again.. I thought it was weird but accepted it.. \nthen he was kicked out off the house and moved in the the house of my mon that she can ceepe with a lot of luck..\nMy twin was only coming in the weekend when my father was gone (i was not allowed to when i was kicked out and I actually needed to give my key.. but my brother was really mean to my dad and the reason i was kicked out was because my twin dindt lay the key of my mothers home unterneet the dourmath.. so i dont get why my dad was so mean to me but not to him..\n\nNow last part of the story.. \n\nNot long ago (now age 19) i was ready with showering and i was changing.. then i saw his face staring at me from one room under the attic (i dint have a door) i screamed and he said he was just saying that he was going to leave.. so i cried for a long time and told my boyfriend about it.. \nHe was so mad and really wanted to punch him in de face.. i sayd not to.. \nSo i ignore my twin when he was around..\nI had nightmares and i\u2019m scared every time i need to change so i\u2019m not good at all right now.. \n\nToday my brother was coming home and he maybe had corona so i said he better leave.. he didnt want to and we start arguing.. then we were coming to this topic and again he denied it..  he was mad and sad.. he sayd he wanted my boyfriend died beacuse he thinks it all his fold.. \nHe says what do i need to do that you believe me i dont see you that way?! Kill myself? \n\nI screamed no ofcourse not! \nHe was sitting down the floore and strated to cry so hard and sayd a few times what is this life.. i didnt thought i would lose my twin today.. (because i sayd i\u2019m moving to another country and never wanted to see him again.. i had a depression angry attack that i dint had in a long time and i was choosing myself for the first time.. so we talked for i while and now i dont know what to believe.. i want to believe  him so bad because i love my twin ofcourse so much.. but the past is what happend and i dont know what to trust now.. \n\nHe wanted to talk to our older sister about it.. so i called her if i can talk to her tomorrow (with just the 2 of us because when my twin is there, he is going to change my mind just like he did today.. \n\nI think my sis is not going to believe this and that she loves him to much just like i do to really believe he is like this.. \n\nSo i dont know what to do and maybe one of you have tips or something??.. \nif not that is no problem this is on me and i really thank you for reading this long story.. \nthankyou!!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

All this first started when my best friend of 7 years broke up with her boyfriend after that he started threatening suicide I wanted to help him and I knew if he did anything she'd get blamed for it she has a hard enough life as is but then one day when I didn't check my messages soon enough he decided to run away to try to die of hypothermia. He was found quickly and for some reason I was deamed as encouraging him to die! Why would I do that? The messages were there I never once did anything like that! But no matter what I try to do I'm always a fuck up somehow! I'm so sick of it. Time went on, because of what happened I wasn't allowed to see my best friend who at the time was my life support, we grew apart I tried to help her has much as I could but she never listened I offered her everything a free home to stay an figure out herself, support, advise, and encouragement but nothing was enough and again somehow I ended up as the bad guy! The last thing I said to her one last push to fix the relationship was \"I can't fix mistakes if you don't tell me what I did wrong if you don't tell me what needs to be changed then this won't work\" and it didn't she said \"you've broken my trust before\" I was fucking astonished I did everything I could for her puting her before myself an somehow I broke her trust? The cherry on top? She refused to tell me what I did! That was the end of that. 7 fucking years of effort waist, 7 years of empty promises and abandoned dreams! \nSomething even better happened before this ending conversation, I sent a picture of them trying to cohabitate 5+ leopard geckos to my partner and somehow I betrayed them for talking to my best friend they asked me to stop talking to them that's what I was working on, doing it my way. A way that wouldn't hurt so much, they expected me to drop someone who had been so fucking important to me for years like it was nothing! So I ask you why can't I ever do anything right? Why is everything I do a fucking mistake? I was doing what they asked wasn't I? I can't fucking think straight enough to tell more of things that happened recently. I'm just so so tired of being in crippling pain, having to walk on eggshells around everyone. I'm tired of being a useless fucking mistake that can't do anything right. I'm tried of being a pathetic failure who doesn't even have enough motivation to clean up the dishes piled up in my room. I'm tired of constantly hoping a dreaming of a day where I have a proper job and house with my partner knowing I'll never even be able to get that job let alone a house. I just want to make them happy, I just want them to live stress free. I know I'll never be good enough to do that. I know I'll never stop being a pathetic fuck up. I know my hopes for the future will always come back to taunt me. There is no good future in this shitty world. At least not for me I gave up on that a long time ago. The one thing I wish would stop is constantly going from emotional pain that makes my chest feel like it's splitting open to absolutely nothing, no tears nothing at all like it never happened to begin with.",

I have been emotionally destroyed over these past 5yrs struggling with post partum depression and dealing with an emotionally draining husband. I dont feel like he loves me anymore and says it's best if I just leave. I've made some mistakes in my marriage and I am extremely sorry for everything that happened and have tried to make up for it but nothing seems to work anymore. I can tell based on the way my husband looks at me, with nothing but hate even though he speaks of love to me. I think it's time for me to leave..permanently. hopefully this way my family has a chance of being happy. I know my daughters love me and I was hoping that was enough, but its not. Im sleeping on the floor of their room and have my almost 2yr old baby in my arms..and I'm giving up..im done with all this pain..I think I'll do it tomorrow when I drop them off with my sister in law..",

I\u2019ve done none of my schoolwork and I\u2019m going to fall behind and that stresses me out so much and yet I just can\u2019t seem to care at the same time. I feel like I\u2019m going insane and we are only two days in. I\u2019ve been binge eating nonstop to try cope but I just feel worse, I can\u2019t even be bothered purging because what\u2019s the point anymore none of it matters. I\u2019m in ED treatment against my will and now I have to constantly be around my toxic family. I was starting to feel better, I was starting to use going out constantly and keeping busy to cope but now I can\u2019t. I just want to s/h but I\u2019m trying so hard not to. I haven\u2019t slept properly since they announced it, I daze off because of the overeating but I can\u2019t sleep solid hours it\u2019s all day in and out of sleep eating then sleeping and worrying and being force fed by my parents who certainly have noticed I\u2019m overeating but are still making me eat meals because they see nothing wrong with binge eating as long as I don\u2019t purge. I fucking hate binging and purging because I feel so out of control but before I just started binging I was purging multiple times a night even though I was sick. I want to be able to restrict but I fucking can\u2019t so I feel so much worse. My antidepressants are stoping me from feelings things properly, I feel like I\u2019m on the verge of a panic attack all the time, I feel like I\u2019m going insane, I want to cry and scream but I\u2019m trapped inside my head. My thoughts are just on a loop. I keep getting flashbacks of last quarantine and how horrible it was and how this time will be the same if not worse because now I\u2019m in year 11 so the workloads increased and my sisters mental health will get worse and everyone and everything will get worse. I feel so fidgety and frantic one second and unable to move the next, I only get out of bed to get more fucking food. I can\u2019t fucking do another lockdown, I\u2019m losing my mind",

        "selftext": "every so often after I run around on the rat wheel I fall off after I realize I\u2019m getting nowhere. My circle grows smaller seemingly by the day. I can\u2019t have discussions with people without pissing them off or vise/versa. My opinions don\u2019t matter, my thoughts are circular, and my presence is obviously a nuisance to those in my general vicinity. \n\nMy interests? almost all gone. \n\nHopes? Dashed. \n\nDreams? What are those?\n\nI just want to lay here. Picking up the phone and typing is a bother. \n\nLet me tell you the problem. So in my head, I see the daily progress I make, as far as self improvement. I\u2019ve quit smoking, chewing, drinking, drugs, and breaking the law in general. This is a marked improvement. I feel very proud of myself after directly after I have done something for about 2 minutes. I then move on to the next thing. \n\nHere\u2019s the kicker. I\u2019m running out of things I can see to improve. On top of this, among my family I\u2019m seen as a \u201cholier than thou\u201d person who has no flaws. So I\u2019m trying to be a better person and every single time I mess up at all, I am met with EXTREME prejudice. I am the therapist of all my small circles because I am an excellent listener, I in fact hear things when people talk that they don\u2019t want me to hear. I am excellent at reading between the lines. \n\nI do not receive the same attention from anyone however. I consistently feel isolated, I consistently feel alone (not lonely, alone), I feel like a complete and utter burden 24/7. To mitigate these feelings I give whatever I can. Which is often taken advantage of and I have actually talked myself into thinking that those taking advantage of me need it more than me. \n\nSo I pretty much have withdrawn from society, not that it\u2019s very hard with covid going on. I live a hermit\u2019s life Other than when I am at work or with my family obviously. I haven\u2019t worked all winter as my job is outdoors and I live in the north. My job is the only place I feel like I\u2019m doing something. I get to teach people to play hockey. Simple, but it\u2019s the only job I can hold down due to my principles on what\u2019s right and wrong. Due to covid it is unclear whether I will be employed soon or not. \n\nSo a quick synopsis of my life to really gel all this together for you, I am alone, jobless, unmotivated, no support system, and currently incapable of moving more than my thumbs because I\u2019m so down. I have to walk on eggshells with everyone I know because everyone except me has feelings. So I\u2019m confused as to what I should even try to do at this point. I have a doctors appointment the 9th to get an ESA but idk if I have the energy to take care of it but idk what else to try. I remember when I was engaged that I went to work willingly because I wanted to pamper her and I want to try to emulate that again. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to pour myself into hobbies, I recently started drawing (charcoals) and I\u2019m not too bad. I\u2019ve been trying to learn to play guitar but my fingers are as incapable as the rest of my body and I have the rhythm of a geriatric worm. \n\nI just want to feel important again. Even if it\u2019s just to myself. I think that\u2019s the worst part. In trying to cope with everything I\u2019ve broken myself down so far that idk if there\u2019s anything worth building up again. Every time Ive tried it\u2019s been an exercise in futility to this point. I may just lay here until I pass away or have to pee.",

        "selftext": "My life is an absolute joke. I did it all to myself, so really this post is redundant I guess but someone will shoot it down if they have to. \n\nI'm turning 20 in 2 months. Ever since 7th grade I've done just about average in school. I've never belligerently gone out of my way to not succeed, just no matter what I did, I couldnt get myself to do well. I was constantly forgetting I had homework all together, no matter what organizational process I had worked to try. I paid attention in class, I came up with answers, and even was mostly friendly with the teachers until it came to the point of my grades. Homework would be late or unturned in, my tests were just piss poor if they weren't in easy classes. Throughout this entire period of time, the only thing that was ever done as some sort of incentive, or help was grounding me. From 7th grade to 10th, I was in my room reading books or helping my father work. In summers when I wasnt grounded, I sat inside on my computer because no matter how many friends I tried to make, I only really had 3. Even now that group remains the same. After I figured out that grounding was doing nothing, I hoped to make a change. I prayed that moving in with my mother would have some sort of benefit to it, and at first it did. The very first quarter of the year went well with good grades, and as time went on it went back to where it started, only now I have no friends. I tried making friends, talking to people, socializing more but people were different up here. \n\nAny person can argue that I'm the common denominator. I must be some sort of asshole, social outcast, narcissist combo. Maybe that person is right, who knows. But I try my hardest every day to appease others, even if it means that I'm put at a deficit. My friends, my family, strangers, whoever it may be. Making people happy is really one of the only things that makes me happy, and I cant even do that anymore.\n\nI don't want to make this too long because nobody is really all too curious, but no matter what I do it wont satisfy my family. My existence pisses off my mother's boyfriend, he takes it out on her, and she yells at me for it. She cant afford to leave him because she put herself into debt (of which part of is mine and I'm paying without a job), and I cant move out because I have no where to go. I'm not nearly smart enough to do any of that. I cant find a job, I dont know how to do my taxes, I cant cook, I couldnt even sustain living on my own. \n\nAnd then theres the end. I cant even imagine what she would go through, and I hate doing it. My mother has lost 3 brothers to drug related causes, and one of them is barely in the same mind set as the rest of us. Me going to the end would send her down the same path. Shes depressed enough as is, and my depression clashing with hers is only making us fight and both more depressed. She only found out recently that I'm unhappy, but I dont think she understands exactly how unhappy I am.\n\ntheres so much that still kills me every day that I feel like an asshole rambling about to people who probably have bigger problems than I do. \n\nI just dont have anywhere to go or any idea what to do.",

He brought a cousin of mine when we weren't born.amd even till this day, we are treated like shit. While she gets to have everything and acts like superior. And, my dad never even contributed or spend a single penny on us till date.(I'm 20+,M. And my brother is 25+,M. He's gonna be 26 next month).\n\n2. Not good at anything except for PC and mobile stuffs.\n\n3. Found out that my mom is cheating. Not really rn, but for a long time. She had affairs before her marriage. But that ended after her marriage and 4-5 years ago I found out that she's been sexting with someone in our neighborhood. I knew that person. And over the years it got worse. Like, I've found solid evidence that she's been sexting with some doctors as well. Like, I've caught her 4 times with different persons. And TBH, I'm more like do whatever your heart wants you to do. Eat what you like and dress how you like. Don't lend ear to what the society will say and all. But it literally breaks my heart after seeing all these in recent years. And the toughest part is that I can't talk to anyone about these. I had have her pretty solid hints over the years that I know what she's bee upto. She's briefly stop. But it'll continue after sometime.\n\n4. My mom is not okay. She has breast tumors, asthma, and is way too weak and gets sick pretty easily. And we're (me and my brother) constantly worries about her. I mean, growing up, she was and till date, is everything all we have. She struggled so much. Like she used to walk miles to get to her job to save some money and not eat properly to save some money so that we can get good food. And whatever happens, we love our mom more than anything. But still, we are too stressed whenever she's sick.\n\n5. I'm in a relationship with a girl that she never accepts. Like, the girl I love, is from a rural area. But she's soo kind hearted and soo good and friendly that I won't even be able to explain in words. It's been 4 years we're togather. But my mom has a sick mentality. Like she's from rural area so she's bad for me(forgot to mention that my mom is From a pretty big city and my dad is from a rural area. And we're currently living at my dad's place). Also, she's a bit dark and my mom really cares about skin tone. Like WTF ! And I really don't judge anyone by what they have, what their past was, what skin tone they are, how poor or rich they are etc. And my mom taught me all these and now she's taking different approach. And it really breaks my heart.\n\n6. The girl I just talked about, does everyone that I specifically told her not to. Like, she's made a huge mess with my mom over chats and regretted later. I've always told her to not to make a mess. And just don't message my mom and if my mom does, just give a decent reply and Don't engage in much conversation. But she always had done the exact opposite. Like 7-8 times and every single time things will get pretty fucked up and then she'll say that she's sorry and never ment to do that. And now I'm sick of those excuses. Once she blocked my mom over our argument and behaved really bad before blocking her. And that was a pretty huge mess. I've told her that whatever happens now, will have an impact on our future. I will convince mom about us and everything will be fine as long as she doesn't mess things up with my mom. But it's all Fucked up now.\n\n7. She has a really bad anger. Like, she's really cute and sweet. But whatever she gets angry and will say stuffs that can't ever be taken back. And the stuff she says, hurts like hell to me. Like, I've already hated my dad. And specifically told her that whatever happens, she won't bring my dad or mom into it. And every single time she'll do that. And the reason I told her not to bring their name bcz I literally hate my dad. He's fucking dead to me. And love my mom and don't want to hear any bad things about her. Even once I hit my dad because he was going to slap mom. And nowadays whenever anything comes up between my mom and dad, I always comes in between so that my dad could never hurt her.(forgot to mention that my dad used to hit my mom and do domestic violence where my grandmother would also take part). \n\n8. It's been hard not gonna lie. I've been depressed, cried, who knows what not. Now I'm at a point where I don't care about anything anymore. Like, if I die, I won't care. Can't share anything with anyone. Generally I always shows up and checks on every single of my friends to see if they are doing okay. And I'm someone they can trust their secrets with. I've listened to everyone. So they they can feel a bit free because I know how hard it is to not having anyone to share. I have always been there. Always tried to help as best as I could even when I'm in a bad position. Helped in every single way I could. Solved their couple issues till 4 am in the morning while having final exams on the next day and what not. Still, when all were having a plan and invited me to the trip to the beach and I said i could go because I have to get my laptop fixed and I have an appointment on that day @11am, one called me a selfie jerk. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. \n\n9. The girl I love, doesn't respect boundaries. Like, there's a lots of dark times for me where I tried to stay positive. And there were days when I cried for hours at night. Because of all the mess she made and how it's gonna effect every single thing. And don't get me wrong. She literally mad for me. Like she can do anything for me. But the thing is she doesn't respect boundaries. I've uninstalled everything when I was going ia lot and couldn't handle myself. Needed to stay off the grid for a few days or weeks. And I told her that I needed some time off to clear my head. But she'd text me and ca me over and over again when I've told her not to contact me in any ways. Not just her but everyone. I tried to stay off the grid to clear my head. And nobody disturbed me but she just couldn't leave me alone for a single day. And that really fucked me up. Now I'm in a state where I'm not sure how i feels, what I eat, what I do, what I keep thinking, when I sleep.and I wanna cry to be a bit free. Like my inside is crashing down by my eyes just wouldn't shed tears.\n\n10. I've been thinking about it. How she'll be better off without me. Like, we're still young and I feels like she'll stay happy years later if we seperate now. I've been trying for months now  but I just couldn't. Finally did the worst thing i could. I broke up some hours ago. TBH, I'm not good and broken inside. But just couldn't cry or feel a bit free. fes Like all the walls are closing on me. \n\n11. Well, in here, depression and mental health is a myth. If you tell someone you are depressed, they say that wake up early and you will be find. Tell someone about mental health and most of them will say there's no such thing. Same thing goes with my mom. I've tried telling her that I'm broken. Not doing okay. And tried to tell her about mental health. But she thinks these are fucking jokes. So after that, I've never brought it up(been a few months). And I don't want to. No more. I might do something stupid if it gets out of hand, but I'd still do that but won't talk to her about these.\n\n12. I worry about my future. Like, I'm doing engineering in computer applications. But in out country, we have a huge unemployment issue. And I know so many people with higher engineering degree that doesn't have a job. And I think I might be unemployed for the rest of my life.\n\n13. I'm sick and couldn't sleep till late night. Because of everything, I'm stressed and just couldn't take care of myself. I'm gaining weight and fat like crazy. Doesn't feels like getting up from bed or more like I don't have enough energy. And I'm so week that I can barely do 5 push-ups at most. And I drink cough syrup so that I can sleep at night peacefully because sleeping pills won't be sold in our country without a prescription and the docs won't give me sleeping pills.\n\n14. Been trying to quit masterbating for a long time. Was doing good. Like once in a while. Barely 2-3 times a week. But it's been 4-5 months, I've been masterbating daily. Some days its2-3 times and some days it's as many as 8 times. And that the only pleasure I get now-a-days TBH. \n\n15. Been having sleep paralysis and weird bad dreams. And idk how to stop. And I'm suicidal. Tried once. But sadly, failed miserably.\n\n\n\nI couldn't remember anymore ATM. I don't know what I wrote. Not gonna review. Now, your turn.",

I try to text friends but they are either busy or could care less. My only passionate sport is actually making me angry because I feel like I\u2019m losing the grove. But that\u2019s just the thing. I get pissed for no reason nowadays. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to turn in an assignment that said it was \u201clate\u201d. Mom came up, scolded me for a late assignment and I literally punched a wall. It sounds.. so childish. And I hate it.. I hate that I spend more time in bed NOT sleeping than I do actually sleeping. I hate that when I do sleep, I have nightmares from trauma. I hate that when I go to therapy it feels like nothing has changed. I\u2019m just sick of everything.. And I don\u2019t know what to do..

I was under the impression that I was a nice person however I recently found out that isn\u2019t true. My whole life people have regarded me as a bitch. I\u2019ve always been the type to separate myself and not get close to anyone because throughout my past I\u2019ve been bullied or made fun of or just plain out ignored. I\u2019ve never felt like I was able to have a close relationship with anyone. Because of that I am aware that I speak before thinking a lot and can come off as mean however I thought that those times were minimal in comparison to the times I genuinely was being kind to others because I didn\u2019t want anyone to feel the way I ever felt. At my age now, my life is a mess and I\u2019m fully aware that it\u2019s my own laziness to blame but I also feel like I\u2019m undeserving of the life I dream of or always wanted. It feels like it\u2019s something I\u2019ll never get because of the life I have lived. Being fully aware of this I no longer wish to live in this.

Ive already started my third with a MC who wants to destroy the world. I had some writing critics from my college and local friend writers read my first two outputs.I pretended I just read it from some random creepy website and I think its cool and I  got hooked to read it. They all said with some editing without changing the plot, this might be a \"hit\" in our local scene. Bad news is that Im a licensed professional who does have an obligation to take care of our citizens and we have strict laws on how we're supposed to maintain our image in public and this kind of writings might affect my reputation. \"Oh he's a _______, why his writings are like that\". I might lose my job for \"misconduct\" and \"ethical issues\".Honestly, I do want to try if I can be a successful writer but I cant risk losing my job that supports my living.

Looking back I think she was only interested in taking my V-card and taking emotional advantage of me, to be there for her when her other exploits didn't go her way. Me and her dated from 16 to 20. She was only a couple months older than me... Finally realized I couldn't love her anymore after the 6th time of her coming back to me for comfort after a misscarage or abortion from another man. Every time she would come back to me she would still be seeing the \"other man\", so I think that's where my insecurities come from. I'm never enough. She was the only person I've ever been able to show how much I love them. And now I don't think I believe in love anymore. Great infatuation maybe. But never love. I've had 4 other women in my life, most in the between times when my 1st would come back. after taking serotonin for my depression at age 18, and then abruptly stopping, I feel I can no longer be happy. The medication gave me increased anxiety, and panic attacks about any and all intrusive or dark thoughts. Those thoughts persist to this day, as does the feeling of panic when they come. At age 28 almost 29, my longest relationship just ended. 7 years. Call her babu. I'm broken. I didn't show her the love she deserved. She cheated on me (all of my ex's did at some point) with a man who she started hanging out with from work. I was very insecure about their friendship, but I let her hang out with him because she promised he was just a friend and that he wouldn't do that to me. As he had that happen to him... but she ended up cheating anyways. I dont blame her. I blame myself. And him to an extent, because he's a liar. I'm now alone while they are (presumably) being happy together. He has everything she's had been wanting. His own place. A good, high paying job. And prospects of marriage. And a cat. I would leave me for him too. No one can convince me other wise... I will always been the lesser man. I'm prepared to be alone for the rest of my life.

Going on is impossible anymore, I try to stay strong, but the harder I try, the more obstacles life creates on my way.\n\nI cannot maintain eye contact, so people treat me like a weirdo, I cannot understand social clues, my voice and understanding of the body language are totally messed up. I cannot interact with people, so being in a huge group, like at school or university has always been a struggle. My social skills are zero, it's like being socially blind. I don't understand humour and cannot joke at all. Everything I say is always off topic, hence constant argumens with my family. Besides, panic attacks make even going out of home a real challenge. When I try to participate in a dialogue, my speech is always a monologue. Everything I do is very awkward and clumsy.\n\nThe real problem is that my country has conscription: people get forcefully drafted into the military. Because of covid they don't have enough conscripts and have to draft people with chronic diseases. The conditions are beyond terrible. Bullying is insane there, so for me there's no way I'll survive. If I refuse, they'll put me in prison, which is way worse than suicide. If it wasn't for conscription, I wouldn't be suicidal, but this is the last straw. I'm done.\n\nMy mother says that I'm making things up, that I'm a disgrace to our family and everyone will point fingers at her for having such a son.

They're ones who've told them too. I got and go through hate alone. And that hurts. \n\nIt's gotten to my own family, them treating me the same as liars who hate me.

Go through even more pain I wanted to die more than I ever have before. \nMe moving on through life without closure, just having to accept that when I ask about what happened, if they know about what people did to me, only to get nothing over and over. \nOnly more lies, them saying \"I never knew\", saying they'll be there for me when they're ones who've hated me. It's all my own paranoia. My own overthinking and projecting. \n\nSo everything I went through, all the pain I've went through never happened. \n\nI won't ever get the truth it appears.

I'm not going to let it happen so much now. I know I have no one.

I don\u2019t know, I feel like I have to say that sometimes because people won\u2019t take me seriously unless I tell them I have a diagnosis. At least, that\u2019s how it felt before I actually had one.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve been through a hell of a year and a half. Like everyone I guess. The pandemic and being forced inside doesn\u2019t really help all that much. But, I\u2019ve been through 2 break-ups. The first in retrospect was toxic and we really weren\u2019t good for each other. We fed off each others insecurities, we used each other in one way or another, it wasn\u2019t healthy. Especially, my codependency. It got to the point where my happiness was attached to the relationship and when it came to it\u2019s disgusting and bloody end, I felt worthless. I had to re-learn how to be a person. Over time, like all things I healed. I found who I was, I fell in love with my local hardcore scene and made some phenomenal friends there, I found EDM and immersed myself in a culture that I never thought could have existed, and eventually I found someone who showed me the care, attention and love I deserved.\n\nThis next relationship was super short but super powerful. We were only officially \u2018together\u2019 for 3 months. But, we\u2019ve been playing this *absolutely fucked* on-and-off game for the past year. After we had broken up, seemingly out of nowhere, I became obsessive about my weight. From as early as I can remember it\u2019s been something I struggled with. I\u2019m not going to lie to anyone and say I was \u201cchubby\u201d or \u201cbig\u201d. I was morbidly obese. I look at pictures of me then and it makes me gag. I\u2019m sorry if that offends someone. But, seeing myself that way makes me sick. I had lost a lot of weight after me and my first girlfriend broke up. I got the revenge body, the revenge attitude, I was on top of the world. But, after me and my most recent ex broke up, it was a never ending spiral down a path I didn\u2019t expect.\n\nWithin a few months I had been diagnosed with OCD, BPD, and Anorexia. I had been denying the last diagnosis for a long time. It took me a lot of time (and a lot of mushrooms) to finally accept it. When I did it wasn\u2019t something I really wanted to address. Until, I collapsed for the first time. This was probably the scariest moment I\u2019ve had up until this point. I had gotten light headed before, I was used to being cold all the time and always being tired. But, this had never happened before. The fact that I hadn\u2019t talked to or seen anyone in months and the first night I actually had gone to socialize, I drop to the floor in front of everyone. Everyone being about 5 or 6 people. This was when I finally started to think about recovery.\n\nI never really was given a resource for recovery. For a while I had been focusing on my move. In November I moved out of my parents house 6 hours away to Massachusetts and in with the one of very few true friends I have. The idea was for me to start my recovery out there so I can be out of the high-anxiety environment that is my parents house. It really didn\u2019t go well. My mental health was on a steady decline. My body dysmorphia was so bad it caused me to quit my job and hide in my room and not even speak to my housemate who slept 5 feet across the hall from me. Eventually, I had had enough. I had had my last mental breakdown and moved home. This was a sign of defeat for me, like I had failed. I know that I didn\u2019t, I know people who went off to college and came home within a week. I lasted on my own fucking dollar for 3 months. \n\nNow, I\u2019m back in with my parents. I\u2019m doing my best, taking things day-by-day or meal-by-meal, whichever it happens to be. But, I don\u2019t really know what to do anymore. My heart hurts. I feel so alone right now. I don\u2019t have many people here. I have maybe two friends I see who don\u2019t seem to want to make the effort to see me. I feel like I\u2019m always going somewhere, doing something for someone. Either baking or picking something up or dropping something off. I just feel used. It\u2019s like I never left my first relationship and she\u2019s manifested as all of the people around me. I also feel kind of forgotten. Like my presence isn\u2019t notable. Like I could sit and speak for hours and not be heard, like I could be somewhere but not be seen. I just don\u2019t really know what to do anymore.",

I\u2019m not \u201cjust sad.\u201d I\u2019m not \u201cin a funk,\u201dand I most definitely won\u2019t \u201cget over it in a few days.\u201d I am depressed and there is no amount of denial that will stop this from being true. No matter how badly you want it to be.\n\nI know this is hard for you, not understanding why your child feels this way. Depression is a hard thing to discuss. It\u2019s even harder to understand sometimes. For people who don\u2019t have depression, it can be hard to understand why people don\u2019t want to live anymore. They have a good life, a good family and are always smiling. Why wouldn\u2019t they want to live? It\u2019s not always just that.\n\nWhile suicide is tied closely to depression, not everyone who has depression wants to die. In my case, it\u2019s more that I can\u2019t find the motivation to live the life I so desperately want. The thing with depression is even the people who are affected by it don\u2019t always understand why. It\u2019s like you\u2019re being held underwater but every once in awhile, you get a big gulp of air before you\u2019re shoved back down. It\u2019s a cycle, one that doesn\u2019t make any sense and one that ruins a person entirely.\n\nLooking up depression on Google won\u2019t help you understand what I\u2019m feeling. When you type in \u201cdepression,\u201d you will get a string of words, which won\u2019t do justice to my feelings. Every website you go to will tell you the same thing. *It\u2019s an imbalance of brain chemicals that result in the feeling of dejection.*\n\nWhat I\u2019m feeling is more than an imbalance of brain chemicals. Sure, that may be what causes it, but I\u2019m not sitting here feeling solely sad because of it. Of course, I\u2019m feeling sadness but also anger, guilt, hopelessness, rejection and so many other things that make every day a challenge.  \n\nI wake up each morning and for a brief moment, I forget how last night I cried myself to sleep. Then, everything sinks in and my brain sends me back into my self-hatred. I am sick and you need to understand that. The simple action of taking cups from my room and putting them in the kitchen stresses me out. I can\u2019t begin to explain why. The only thing I ever want to do is lay in bed and sleep, to remove myself from this world for the time being, until I can get a grasp on why I\u2019m feeling like this.\n\nI don\u2019t enjoy the things I used to. So when you suggest I go out of my room or go for a walk, I don\u2019t want you to take it personally when I decline. I simply don\u2019t find joy in anything anymore, not even living. Depression has stolen who I was before, the smiling girl with an attitude like her father\u2019s and a laugh that traveled through the house. I\u2019m not that girl right now. I\u2019m different and I\u2019m trying to be OK with that.\n\nI don\u2019t need you guys to remind me I\u2019m different. I can feel I\u2019m different. Every time I lose motivation, every time I distance myself and every time I lock myself in my room, I know I am    \n\ndifferent. I know you\u2019ve noticed how I\u2019ve changed and I can tell you\u2019d prefer the old me to the new me. I do too.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I yell at you. When I get so overwhelmed with everything, I tend to attack those who I care most about. I push everyone away because in my eyes, depression is a disease I want to keep my family away from. I don\u2019t want any of you feeling the way I do, ever.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I lock myself in my room all the time, leaving you alone downstairs. I can\u2019t handle life sometimes and shutting down is the only way I know how to cope. I know you get angry when I do this but I can\u2019t help it. I hope you can understand. I\u2019m trying and though it doesn\u2019t seem like much, it\u2019s a lot for me.\n\nI don\u2019t always know what I need to feel better. So when you ask what you can do and I answer with, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It\u2019s not me being annoyed by your question. I truly have no clue how someone can help me when I can\u2019t even help myself.",

Things that most likely won't ever happen because of how unconfident and anxious I am. But also these past events have lived in my mind for so long. I think up of alternate outcomes back then that maybe could've changed how my life would turn out. Like a teacher pulling me aside asking if I'm okay. Or my mom comforting me after an awful and embarrassing day at school. I have nightmares about my school days (which ruin my whole day after i wake up) because those really are my only vivid memories. Now I just hide and I'm too afraid to do anything. I'm a husk with no useful parts whatsoever. I'm no longer that bubbly kid I used to be trying to entertain people. I don't even know if I want to do any of this all over again if given the chance. Now I'm an awkward man with slight daddy issues who is in desperate need of any kind of real-life companionship from someone who actually cares about me.\n\nI feel so pathetic.",

I cannot get out and enjoy our beautiful country which is so unique in snow and ice like everyone else today. Even the so called loved ones around me are going. I am at home and will need to explain that 10 times in my \u2018social network\u2019 in coming days. While I love to get out there to cycle and run.....well....that won\u2019t happen any time soon. Fuck that!!\n\nWhat hurts even more is the Zero interest that people have in my physical nor mental condition. In workplace lockdown for a year now, i work so hard to keep things going, to let no one be affected...nobody but me. But does anyone see that? No. Does anyone ask how I\u2019m doing? No. Does anyone make different choices to maybe show some interest, appreciation or acknowledge I exist? No. \nThe only one asking is a chat friend. My single and heavenly flow of positivity and excitement. I\u2019m not bothering her with my negativity!!\n\nShould I stop prioritizing others over myself? No! That will hurt and isolate me even more....\n\n\nSoo much ache in my body, I just don\u2019t know where to put it......",

        "selftext": "This is a long one, but I really need help. I turned 20 two months ago and have been experiencing depression since I was about 8 years old. I have always had difficulty making friends and keeping those friendships. I have been suicidal on and off throughout the years and it\u2019s always felt like something people try to use against me. I am a college student at a school in the south where Greek life is a big thing and am in a sorority. This year I moved into the house and decided to room with a girl I didn\u2019t know extremely well but well enough where we thought it would be a good fit. Prior to this I had never shared a room before and had always been messy, and I told her this. She even saw how messy my freshman dorm was and told me it was okay because she was messy too. Flash forward we move in together in August and things were okay I thought. I got rather depressive the first semester but never really talked about it because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable enough in the space. There were days I couldn\u2019t even force myself to get out of bed, shower, brush my teeth, much less clean. Sometimes she hinted at my mess bothering her but never went into too much detail. I had a big falling out with one of our mutual friends who was very bad to me and really triggered me, to the point I tried to commit suicide in January when we had just gotten back from Christmas break. It made my roommate uncomfortable and scared because she said she\u2019d never really been around depressed or suicidal people before. My best friend also seemed a little worried at the time. However she continued to constantly hang out with and cancel our plans to hang out with the same girl that had triggered me and that made me feel very invalidated and uncomfortable. I tried expressing this but she didn\u2019t quite get it. I ended up leaving school to take my classes remotely because my parents were worried and thought it would be for the best. I\u2019ve been home since then and it\u2019s now March. No one had really reached out to me much to see how I was doing which kind of hurt but I chose not to dwell on it because everyone is busy with their own lives. I tried once more to tell my friend why I was uncomfortable that she had become so close with this girl that hurt me so badly and told me I can\u2019t blame killing myself on her because it\u2019s not just her and I can\u2019t expect her not to be friends with her even though all of my therapy sessions are spent talking about this girl. A week ago I had noticed my roommate blocked me on social media and was very hurt and confused. I didn\u2019t want to lash out or act out of emotion so refrained from immediately texting her. Instead I went to my best friend to talk about it, who was also friends with her, because I needed help and didn\u2019t know what to do about the situation much less what I had done. She wouldn\u2019t speak on the situation, which at the time I didn\u2019t understand, but was being very weird about it and I was very hurt. Something just seemed off. So I asked if she was mad at me and her response was \u201cIt\u2019s just a crazy situation,\u201d which doesn\u2019t really put my mind at ease at all. A week later I work up the courage to talk to my roommate and discuss what happened and she told me an authoritative figure told her to do it because my messiness had been triggering her anxiety and gave her panic attacks and it was my fault she was in therapy. I felt horrible, I just wanted to end it then and there. I had no clue any of this was happening and it felt like the whole world was crashing down on me. It hurts so much knowing I caused something like that but genuinely did not know. It also hurts me that my best friend is siding with her and is choosing to ignore me because of these circumstances but couldn\u2019t do the same for me with the girl that triggered me into almost killing myself. I genuinely didn\u2019t know this was happening and feel awful and have sincerely apologized and plan on fixing my behavior when I am well enough to return, but the girl who hurt me knew everything was happening and never did or said anything to aid my situation yet my best friend cannot support me in any way. It all just hurts so much I want to end it so badly I just feel so alone and like no one cares or would care if I did and don\u2019t know what to do. I really don\u2019t have any other friends and don\u2019t know why I should continue living if the only two people I have left to consider my friends are against me. This is all I can think about and it\u2019s so tiring and I can\u2019t live like this.",

Just recently got a job and thought that it may help but nothing still feel the exact same. It feels like nothing is ever really gonna make me happy, and it sucks because everyone around me expects me to be happy. I don\u2019t like being around people except my friends who sometimes give me a minuscule amount of joy and not because they are bad friends because i mostly just feel nothing. Being alone is what I prefer but it\u2019s also sad and depressing. I\u2019ve read so many post saying that I should find a hobby I like but I know it will virtually do nothing for me.

I've always been the strong one, the one who can do it all, the one everyone vents to but what about me? I can help everyone but myself. They can't even call me and ask me if i'm ok, they just go ahead and vent about their pity little problems that would be like paradise to me.\n\nI just feel so alone. I feel so guilty. I feel worthless. The slightest trigger just places me back to those dark times when i was a child and would be abused by my father. I'd witness him hitting my mother, every weekend i had to sleep with a knife under my pillow, a few times he treid to molest me, he would destroy everything in the house, he'd hit me its an endless list of 18 years of torture. Now as an adult i realized how little my family cared about my wellbeing. Noone cared about me. Noone could say \"lets take her in\". It sucks to have endured that. Part of this caused me to deviate from my family. I have no desire or will to contact them but at the same time i feel sad that i couldn't have a normal, happy supportive family....... I've locked all those negative feelings away and the past years they been coming out one by one. I can't take it anymore. This loneliness and pain.\n\nI feel like i suck as a mother. I don't have any patience, i want to raise respectful kids but i'm exhausted. 24/7 in this house with them. I just need to breathe. BUT god forbid i try to breathe, i'm judged by everyone and their mother.\n\nI try to be the best wife i can. I cook delicious food, food on the table before husband gets home, clean kids and house WHY can't i receive some recognition? some respect? my husband works all the time and now he's going to be working an extra day. \\[i know he's not cheating, but hey; you can never fully trust a man\\] but jesus christ, when was the last time he asked me out on a date?  we arent a super affectionate couple and i miss this. i just need a hug. I need someone to ask me how am I, to let me vent. he;s so absent. there are times when i can't hold it anymore, I have a drink and vent to him but it's like he's not there. I understand he never been through a single problem in life due to his perfect parents, i also understand he's not a therapist but god i just need a hug, some genuine caring and appreciation. We argue so much it's insane. But he's like a grinch. I love him but i don't feel that from him.\n\nI'm tired of blaming myself for everything. For not being able to control this. For having daily suicidal thoughts \\[thank god for my kids otherwise i'm sure i would've been dead by now\\]. It's exhausting. I feel numb at this point. I'm not even half of the person i used to be before. I want to feel like mysef again.",

I still chose him as my support partner at the hospital which was a mistake since I could only choose one and could not switch. I basically went through birth alone and stayed at the hospital alone for three days afterwards. I was soon realizing that this is real and done. \n\nHe plans to eventually move to another state and agreed that I could move back home to get support since we moved to a place where it\u2019s just his family and I\u2019m a stay at home mom, or was. I\u2019ll be 12 hours away &amp; he truly hasn\u2019t helped at all. My baby is a month old now and I think he can count on one hand how many diapers he\u2019s changed, he never asks about her or comes and sees her. Our other daughter is 4 and he isn\u2019t even spending time with her like he should be. \n\nI think I\u2019m just venting on how much I fucked up by choosing him to be my daughters father.  He is going out and drinking, playing video games while living at his friends house, and getting a full 8 hours of sleep. I\u2019m struggling with balancing a newborn and young child all on my own while trying to pack my life up and move. \n\nThis man changed completely in one year, after we got married I never thought he would leave me. We have been together since 2015.  I can\u2019t believe I failed my girls on a shit father. I failed miserably. I hope in a year I can look back on this post and just be in a completely different state of mind, successful, full of joy, with two happy children. \n\nI hope one day when I\u2019m healed I can give them a father that they deserve too.",

I drank alcohol every day to mask the pain.\n\nA couple of months ago someone tipped me about psilocybin (mushrooms). I spent months since then to read all research I could find about the topic.\n\nSo, I decided to try. I found a dealer, and bought a gram of dried Psilocybe semilanceata. 3 weeks ago I tried just 0.05g to test. It felt funny, and after a short while, I felt nothing. \n\nSo, a couple of days later, I tried 0.3g on an empty stomach in the morning. This time I got a serious effect. Some kind of funny dizziness about one hour after ingestion. I laid down and closed my eyes. Suddenly a bunch of old nice memories rushed through my head. SO nice \u2764. After about 30 minutes this stopped, and I just felt warm and calm. All negative thoughts had disappeared. This lasted for the rest of the day.\n\nThe next day I expected to feel bad. But, no. I still felt great. All negative thoughts had disappeared, just like that \ud83d\ude0a\n\nNow two weeks later, I still feel great. I feel light and happy. I suddenly see joy in life, and I smile every day. I haven't touched alcohol since \ud83d\ude0d I just hope it lasts. If I get difficult thoughts back, I will do this again.\n\nI dare to say that just one small dose of psilocybin cured me of my depression.\n\n\ud83d\ude18",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been up nearly 2 hours writing this and I can\u2019t do it anymore, i\u2019ll add a part 2 soon in the future because i find this very therapeutic &amp; want to know if anybody has experienced depression based off of traumatic events just like i have. Feel free to pm me to talk as i\u2019ll take all the support i can get. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nPart 1: \n\n\nI\u2019m 20 &amp; I\u2019ve previously posted in this sub before but now i\u2019m gonna post about my depression in it\u2019s entirety. \ngrowing up i had a SHIT TON of dramatic stuff happen: grew up around a partying parent which led into alcoholism (worst trauma by far) death of dad at 13, death of my grandmother at 15 and now currently my ongoing depression. \n\nparents alcoholism: my mom took care of my 2 brothers &amp; i, by herself basically her entire 20\u2019s when she all of us in just under 4 years. My dad wasn\u2019t around ever really &amp; my mom did a good ass job taking care of us in my opinion. She had an issue with partying and alcoholism but she still managed to keep us well rounded &amp; on a routine to get to school everyday, and be functioning normal kids for our age. My early years consisted of very faint memories but from what I remember they were nothing like the years I remember more vividly. The only trauma i have from back then is one time, when my father hit my mom\u2019s current boyfriend over the head with a pipe &amp; completely bloodied his face resulting in obviously a traumatic scene for a 6 year old. Besides that there was nothing really until i got older &amp; the alcoholism became more apparent. A few years later when i was around 9 i moved neighborhoods &amp; my mom socially decided to move on away from that area, along with that lifestyle she was living (or so i thought)\nall was well when we first moved as we were closer to her family (my grandparents) and she was away from that toxic area filled with just drama &amp; trauma for her &amp; us. As time proceeded on she began to drink solely by herself more and more frequently. There would be week long stretches where she would just drink drink drink till she literally couldn\u2019t do it anymore &amp; was sick on the couch for a day or two, resulting in us having to essentially take care of her at the ages of 8,10 and 11. This was an ongoing thing for YEARS and is still an issue right now but for the purpose of limiting this post I won\u2019t talk about this any further. The trauma from that comes in many different ways, from seeing my mom literally get dragged home by a stranger (who could have easily raped / killed her), to having cops come to our house, and years of just seeing my mom just physically &amp; emotionally hurt herself from alcohol abuse. I went to school worrying, as a child, as to what mom i was going to come home to that very night. Was it gonna be the mom who forgets we exist &amp; neglects us for a week straight? Or was it going to be her normal self who is the complete opposite. The fear of worrying about her sobriety when i went to school was something i dealt with from ages 9-16 regularly which I honestly think is a major reason i have the anxiety that i do today. \n\nDeath of dad: this one will be shorter but my dad wasn\u2019t around much as he too was dealing with substance abuse in a more severe form. He and his girlfriend were always nice people from what I remember, but as i got older i have begun to realize the issue that they both had in common, hard drugs. I don\u2019t think i was ever in the presence of him doing drugs &amp; same with his girlfriend, but i do know all the facts now that i\u2019m older &amp; i can definitely see why this was true and why he was never around consistently in my life. My mom and him didn\u2019t get along &amp; she always bad mouthed him for it (which I didn\u2019t understand) but knowing what i know now about both sides (mom &amp; dad) it doesn\u2019t make sense &amp; it\u2019s honestly sad that my mom manipulated me as a child into hating my father for not being around given everything that she did while we were in her presence. On December 27th 2013 my father died suddenly at age 37 to pneumonia out of the blue. I honestly didn\u2019t know what pneumonia was up until years later, and after speaking to my mom about it &amp; figuring out what it was, i began to put the pieces together rather quickly as to how he died from this usually non lethal infection. He was abusing substances the days before passing away, so obviously in the mind of someone using he obviously thought it was just some sort of cold or something which is why he never went in to get an actual evaluation for his health. It\u2019s honestly heartbreaking to know the way he died (drowning in his sleep) due to fluids in his lungs (pneumonia) &amp; that a simple trip to a doctors office &amp; antibiotics would mean he would still be alive right now. it\u2019s something i literally think about alot at this time of the night just because of how unlucky I truly am, At the age of 13 i lost the chance at ever getting to see my father again &amp; the chance at possibly ever getting to reconnect &amp; have an actual relationship with my dad all because of substance abuse. My father\u2019s funeral was by far the MOST traumatic day of my life &amp; for good reason. Days before the funeral i was adamant about not wanting to go at all &amp; wanting to stay home to dismiss any feelings for him &amp; the situation. As the days went on my mom said it\u2019ll be the biggest regret of my life if I didn\u2019t go and didn\u2019t get to say goodbye and for that reason solely I decided to go to his funeral to say my goodbyes. Going into the funeral I didn\u2019t know there were different funeral types but when i got there i sure figured that out quickly. When i got there i was greeted by family I haven\u2019t seen in years &amp; ironically it was one of the happiest days of my life because they were such crucial components of my childhood &amp; were apart of many good memories from early on in my life. After all the greetings and love from family &amp; friends of my dads, we were entered the funeral home to say our goodbyes to my father. Right when i walked into the door in the corner of my eye i saw a disfigured almost wax looking figure in my view &amp; immediately looked away thinking it was the corpse of someone else\u2019s funeral. About 20 minutes into being there my dad\u2019s father asked us if we are ready to go say our goodbyes and of course I reluctantly agreed. Upon walking up there i felt no emotion whatsoever until getting closer &amp; closer until eventually i was able to analyze my fathers dead body just sitting there in a casket lifeless. It\u2019s was honestly horrifying based on the fact that it looked like a fake wax figure clone was in the casket replacing him when in reality thats just what a dead lifeless body looks like. After standing there for like 30 seconds i began to sob just purely based on fear &amp; realization that my father was actually dead and that there was no way to avoid it this time. Every possible emotion was going through my head in regards to him &amp; everything that happened and from what I remember, I instantly left after that to get fresh air due to the fact that i was basically having a panic attack from what i had just saw. A few hours later we went to the funeral yard to bury him, and all I remember from that event was standing as far away as possible from the casket to get the day over with &amp; out of my memory for life. I obviously threw a rose on the casket as it was lowered, but asides from that i had very minimal involvement just based purely on the trauma i experienced already in that day. \n\nmy granny: my granny was the stereotypical older woman in life that would make all her neighbours cookies &amp; was just honestly the sweetest person on the earth. She was the most generous &amp; lovely person ever to grace my life &amp; is someone i miss dearly to this day. When my mom would drink back when we were younger, our granny would always know just instincts &amp; would come over for a week or two to help straighten everything out &amp; help my mom out with her addiction. She would cook us food &amp; do everything she could to make everything completely better. She was just the most amazing person ever &amp; is someone who words can\u2019t describe truthfully. Losing her was 10x more traumatic for me then losing my dad &amp; honestly i cannot tell you why. I will forever miss her Christmas gifts of small useful items, her kindness, and just her overall presence and amazing energy. January 4th 2015 in the midst of one of my moms drinking outbursts she randomly blurts out that my granny dies right when i come home from school. At first, obviously with her being drunk i asked her what the hell she was talking about &amp; not to say that until she told me she was telling the gods honest truth with tears in her eyes. I honestly will forever remember that day due to the fact that it was an awful day at school, and an even worse day when i got back home later that day. A days or two later my aunt wanted the entire family to just get together and see each-other after what had happened &amp; the look on my grandfathers face and the emotions he had will forever touch a string in my heart till the day i die. He was known for being stoic &amp; never emotional but to see the love of his life die the way that she did &amp; to experience it after 40+ years together it has to be the saddest thing I\u2019ve experienced in my life not for myself but just for him. The funeral itself was traumatic just because i was numb to the situation &amp; it still didn\u2019t feel real, but when I realized what happened i was in shock &amp; broke down the most i ever have in my life (besides my dad\u2019s funeral). My granny suddenly died on her way to cuba for her yearly vacation out of the blue. She felt severely ill on the plane and as soon as they landed in Camaguey she was rushed to the hospital and put on iv\u2019s. Later on she was diagnosed with pneumonia as well which was untreated but in the midst of her arrival to the hospital she randomly had a massive heart attack resulting in her death. To this day i still have guilt just for never getting to say bye and stuff like that to her for all that she did and despite it not being in my control, i still just feel pure guilt every single day. \ud83d\udc94",

When we got back together I was aware that she wanted to make an onlyfans to make some extra money. I was hesitant to agree but hey, it's her body right? So I went with it. Over the last month I've seen her hiding her phone a lot. She never did that when we were initially together so of course I grew suspicious. She told me she had the only fans and she likes the attention she gets from guys; but I didn't have to be worried about anything. Ever since I was little I've always been right about my gut feelings. Always. I knew things have been going south because she always has her phone 4 inches away from her face so I can't see her screen. Well on valentines day she wanted to go to Starbucks and get a couple of coffees. She was looking online at the menu and passed the phone to me asking what I wanted. I already knew so I went straight to her snapchat. I see rows of guys. My names not even visible. I open one of the chats and see her sending nudes to a man from our city. Multiple men from our city. I keep quiet and later ask her what she has sent to guys on snapchat, and she proceeds to tell me nothing. Now I know she has lied to me. And the lies keep piling up. They get worse and worse by the day.  Tonight I pulled up her reddit and seen multiple multiple messages to and from guys. All containing NSFW pictures on both ends. One conversation I found in particular is a guy saying he's willing to drive here to meet up with her. And she says she's really hoping for it. I've confronted her on a few things but most things I've been bottling up. She swears she hasn't cheated on me. But how am I to know what to believe anymore? I did so much work to get back here; and I don't know if I have the strength to go through this again. I know it all sounds very bad. And it probably is. I just need somebody to tell me.",

I don\u2019t think I have any value or mean anything to anyone in my life. \n\nOver the summer my ex brokeup with me for a second time. I wasn\u2019t 100% perfect in the relationship so i dont completely blame him for not wanting me. We both had issues. But the way it happened had me messed up for a while. We were having issues so i thought a break would help, he agreed, two weeks later he thinks its best to stay broken up. Three weeks later he is dating a friend of his. A girl whome i was already suspicious about and he said i was being too jealous and overreacting. Well soon as we brokeup they are a thing. He got over 2 years so quickly. He was my first love and who i gave my virginity to and he got over me quick and dated his friend . I guess i didnt mean anything to him. It took me a while to get over this and it was rough but i did and gained my self esteem back and got to a good place\n\nThen over winter break i had a fallout with my mom. It wasnt the only time but definitely the worst one. My mom has a lot of issues of her own which she used me as a punching bag. Whenever she was upset or something went wrong for her she\u2019d blame me and belittle and verbally/emotional abuse me. I usually would just take it because tbh i was afraid of her and afraid of making everything worse. But We had a huge fight over winter break and I couldn\u2019t take her insults anymore so i yelled back for the first time ever and it led to her kicking me out. During the fight she basically told me she didn\u2019t want me there or need me and I wasn\u2019t welcome there. My father has always been too busy with work and his finances to care much about me. Work and money always took precedence for him. Especially since the divorce with my mom left him in a lot of debt because of her poor financial decisions. Additionally, my mom kicked out my older brother too so he now lives with my dad as well as my little brother and so there was no room for me to live with him. I have my own place near my college fortunately due to attending on scholarships which pay for my housing. So i am fortunate to have a place for now but if I didn\u2019t there wouldn\u2019t have been any room for me with my dad. He already is always preoccupied with my brothers and his work and finances to really care or deal with me. I\u2019m not upset though. I understand, he has always had a lot on his plate because my mom dumps everything on him. And because i always was more independent and am the only one of their kids to attend college and on a full scholarship i suppose he saw this as me being able to function fine on my own. I feel that if/whenever i do need something from him I\u2019d only burden him and make everything harder for him so i try not to and it seems as though my mom never really wanted any kids so i\u2019m a burden to her definitely.\n\nRight before and during all the stuff with my mom i meet an amazing guy who treated me wonderfully. He helped me with a lot and we started dating, i liked him a lot and things were great and i was happy until recently. The other week he had been very distant but i assumed it was just because he had a lot of exams and was very busy. I asked him about it though and he eased my suspicions by telling me everything was fine and he was just stressed/busy with exams. But today he changed the narrative and told me he needed a break because he was having some personal issues and he\u2019d felt that way for a while. I told him I understood and it was fine. I knew something was wrong but he told me it wasn\u2019t so I believed him initially. I was always very honest with him and open about everything so i expected the same from him but turns out i expected too much. He said he only wants a break for space to figure things out and he does want to be with me but i cant help but feel like this is over as well. He says i did nothing wrong and was great to him and its him who just needs to figure out his stuff. But i know a break is just a breakup waiting to happen so i\u2019ve already accepted that its over. I just feel like my trust was betrayed because i had asked him earlier if everything was okay and he lied and said yes only to want to end things later.\n\nI have friends but my college is 4hrs from theirs so i dont see them. And i dont really have any at my own college. It was so hard to make any strong ones and because of covid the few ones i did make stayed back home so they arent here either. \n\nOverall i feel like nearly every relationship in my life has gone to shit. My own mother didn\u2019t want me. My dad is too busy/preoccupied with work and my brothers to have time or resources for me, and every romantic relationship i have goes to shit and ends whether i do everything right or not. I\u2019m starting to think i just dont matter to anyone. That my existence means nothing to those whome meant everything to me. I guess i\u2019m easily forgettable.

School is closing small shops went under ect.. \n\nI know that it wasn't just hard on me and I hate talking about myself so I am going to make it quick  I am writing  about me this is how is all started with my fight with depression.                                                                                                                             \n\n\nThere was this guy I liked a lot and  I did for things for him  he knew me inside out and few months and it was great six months is coming up and the school dance was up to and that's when things went out the window he started to be very abusive physical and emotional. He told all my secrets made up lies and messed up  almost all my friendships. That's not it he outed me and then made out this girl in front of me saying that he never even liked me in the first place he didn't like guys . So I relapsed he found out after gym class he watched me change I know that my friend took a picture of him doing it and  ratted me out to his friend group.\n\n My mom and dad found out and a few months later we moved and he got ahold of me one time and try   to say I am sorry and a lot of bs I blocked him and acted like I was making out with some random person before you think anything my friend was on the bus he knew my history and helped me out nothing happened and my old boyfriend never called again off that sad stuff I have a boyfriend who knows about my past and still treats me with love and respect.\n\nThings get better and it's okay to ask for help if you can't do it alone and we all fall sometimes but your loved and you beautiful.   No matter what you go threw there is someone always right there Teens I know high school is hard and confusing and  I can't promise that is will make sense but what I know is keep someone close to you  who loves and cares about you it's dark right now but I promise keep your fight there is a light.",

It's also affecting my memories really bad. I have no energy to the point where it feels like this huge weight I'm carrying around all the time- like trying to run when under water.

It's an absolute disaster and, for those who actually tend to be introverted Netflix lovers, coming to terms with the mere fact that they are indeed depressed must be extremely difficult in itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut for me, and for many others I'm guessing, depression feels like an entirely different person. Depression makes me so different from who I \"truly\" am, takes me so far away from what I \"truly\" love, that I am really angry at myself for allowing myself to feel this way.  \n\n\nI remember in particular being an extremely sociable little girl, with a leadership mindset, humour and  a strong personnality. But I can definitely tell that depression has made it harder for me to leave the house (lockdown definitely doesn't help) and maintain relationships. And I haven't \"led\" a group of people in years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still make an effort to be plaisant around others. If you're depressed, please, for the love of God, be kind to others and smile and be positive in conversations. People will like you and want to be around you. It can make a great difference to be a kind human, even if you're sad or angry and want others to know to try and get some support. *It's better to have positive relationships with people who don't know you're depressed and aren't doing anything to relieve the pain than to have negative relationships with people who know you're depressed because those \\*won't\\* want to help you (and you can't blame them)*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother example is: I love languages and I'm curious about history. If I gather the courage to study the languages I'm trying to learn, or if I read a book about history, or if I lift, I know I'll be happy, fulfilled, and closer to my life goals, but God knows it feels impossible most days to just... not be in my pyjamas submitting homework just minutes before the deadline. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hate being at home, I don't like watching TV or playing video games or being on the Internet, I don't even like sleeping or eating so much. It feels like everything that I like is precisely what depression is making difficult to do. (Disclaimer : I'm probably wrong in thinking so. Maybe I've been brought to hate the things I've listed before because I've associated them with depression.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnybody else feels the same way?",

        "selftext": "Since middle school, I\u2019ve felt low. But 1 1/2 years ago, depression came at me in full swing and hasn\u2019t stopped since. \n\nI spent my whole junior year feeling miserable and hopeless, but kept it hidden from my friends for the most part. I couldn\u2019t be miserable around them if I tried; I automatically put on this \u201cI\u2019m completely OK\u201d mask and act like a clown. I only had enough energy to maintain my grades, and did very little college app prep. I really only got through the year bc school was pushing me to perform well. However, I spent a lot of time home alone and did SH, which as of now I haven\u2019t done in a year. \n\nWhen covid shut down school it almost pushed me over the edge. I had no motivation to do anything and just existing had never felt so painful. Even with nothing to do, I barely slept. To this day I still can\u2019t get good sleep, it\u2019s one of my biggest problems. Eventually I realized that I\u2019d seriously hurt myself if I didn\u2019t seek help, so I made up a BS excuse to talk to my doctor and got prescribed mirtazapine. It gave me strength to deal with living, but with all of the work of being a senior I still can\u2019t keep up with myself.  \n\nI\u2019m so disgusted, but not at myself. I severely screwed up college apps because the motivation just wasn\u2019t there, and I barely applied anywhere. I gave up applying to my dream school and many other great schools because I just felt that shitty. I\u2019ve wasted years not being able to pursue my interests because I had and still have no drive. I\u2019m so uninterested in everything, and now I\u2019m even beginning to think that eating is chore. \n\nI can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve showered or brushed my teeth more than 4 days in a row, and I definitely can\u2019t remembered doing both for more than 3. \n\nBesides my depression, I have another thing weighing me down: my sexuality. I completely accept it, but it devastates me socially. Almost all of my close friends know (all straight women except 1), but I never talk about that part of myself. I hardly talk to one friend group anymore because all they talk about are guys. I have 0 to contribute and I\u2019d like to say that I wish could relate to their convos, but I don\u2019t want think about men in that way, and I guess that\u2019s the point. In the rare occasion that I do talk about something related to my sexuality I feel gross, a creep, weirdo, etc. I can\u2019t even say the L word, I hate that word with a burning passion.  \n\nI could go on forever, but I probably should go to bed. \n\nI\u2019m so close to the finish line of graduation and getting to soft reset my life, but I want to give up  so bad right now.",

I abused phenibut high doses daily for the third time now. Currently I\u2018m tapering off.\n\nAbout maybe 2 weeks ago I still was in big suffer from Phenibut withdrawal (hellish anhedonia, withdrawal, insomnia). Then I found the perfect combination of supplements, my actual stack. After started taking it in the morning on an empty stomach, guess what I don\u2018t feel depressed anymore and my phenibut withdrawal symptoms are completely vanished, no withdrawal at all.\n\nThis stack really healed me and my mental illness. My cognition is better, I feel very clearheaded and focussed now. Much better memory. I didn\u2018t feel like this since ages. I don\u2018t feel depressed anymore. Social anxiety? Well social anxiety is still present, but I\u2018m just perfectly fine with it and being myself just as I am. Through this I suddenly found myself being much more relaxed and social at work, in the city or with friends. So being confident with being myself and accepting social anxiety as a part of mine suddenly reduced my social anxiety.\n\nI would describe the effects as if everything is just perfectly right where it is right now. Total calmness and inner peace. I finally feel normal.\n\nP.S. The greatest effect and positive changes occured after adding methylfolate to my stack but I won\u2018t tell you that it was methylfolate only as it could have also been the other supplements in my stack starting to show effects after taking them regularly for some time. Either way taking any of these supplements can\u2018t harm you but just do good for your body, brain and mind. In the worst case they do nothing.\n\nTo the stack:\n* Multivitamin with Zinc, Selen etc.\n* Mr. Happy Stack (Omega 3, Uridine 200mg subl., CDP-Choline 250mg)\n* Creatine 5g\n* Agmatine 3x1g\n* NAC 2x1g\n* L-Theanine 500mg\n* Spirulina x10 (Idk how many mg)\n* Methylfolate 1000mcg\n* Magnolia Bark x2 (Idk how many mg)\n* Inositol 2x3g (up to 12-18g possible)\n\nMaybe this can help some others that well like it does for me.

Whenever I think of myself then I'm awful and they get mad at me.\n Saying \"we don't hate you\", \"I don't think anyone hates you\". When they've never been through what I've been through, their the ones who put me through it.\n\n And try and make it about themselves whenever I say they've never been through what I've been through because of what they did and do to me.\n\n I'm used to people saying bad things never happened, or they don't believe me, if it did happen then it's my fault only. I'm used to it but I'm tired. \n\nIt's always all of them against me, saying I'm in the wrong for any reaction I have to them treating me like shit. They say I'm playing the victim, that I'm dramatic, call me names and mock me. So they can continue on treating me like shit over and over again. Ignore me when I want to talk, interrupt and talk over me. Always say I'm wrong because it's only one person against them all.\n\nI am so fucking used to standing alone, going through it all alone, but fucking tired of thinking someday someone will care. \nNow I care for me a lot more than I used to. Defending myself like I'd defend someone else, because I don't feel like how I did back then, now and can stand up for myself. And I will.\n\n Yeah I still cry, but less, because I did something for me, stood up for myself. It will always hurt though. They do things to me I'd never do to them. And that's how I'm playing victim, because I'm not like them and I don't do the shit they do to me and I'd never.\n\nTwo things I can say for sure: that I know I am, and always will be a good person, and I will always go through it all alone.\n\n(I support others going through similar shit, but I don't feel up to giving sympathy and ignoring my own shit this time, I just needed this vent)",

I have kids and cats so anything involving tiny objects is out and I also dont have a \"me\" space in my house other than my work desk which is covered in work.\n\nI'm probably just going to go to my doc and have him up my meds and see if that helps.

I could\u2019ve been part of the graduating class of 2022. \n\nI\u2019m always having thoughts along the lines of \u201cif I hadn\u2019t/had ... then I could be/would\u2019ve ...\u201d Example: if I hadn\u2019t taken my second semester off freshman year, I would\u2019ve been on track. If I hadn\u2019t then (barely) attended two semesters at another university for the 2019-2020 school year and failed most of all the courses I took, I would\u2019ve continued school for the 2020-2021 school year.  If I had put in at least a tiny bit of effort to study for my college courses anddd the year long certification program I was in, I would A) still be in college B) be certified and working and afford rent for an apartment C) hang out with people my age (in a safe, covid restriction abiding way) and D) be a potential candidate for (specific type of professional) school!!\n\nINSTEAD.. I took time off, never recovered a sense of motivation and a work ethic, got on academic probation with like a 0 GPA hahahaaaaa, failed my first attempt for my certification exam, and stayed at home all last year without being around other college students in a fun, collegey environment - not that that was really possible for anyone because of the pandemic, but still - I keep seeing college students I know on social media hanging out with each other and having fun and accomplishing things. I gave up on my dream career because it\u2019s definitely impossible at this point to be worth a look for admissions committees - if I even manageee to finish college. I\u2019m sad (you know typical years-long depression stuff), envious of people I know in college, disappointed while seeing myself as a failure, and hopeless. \n\nLet me assure you I, certainly like all of you, know all the pick yourself up again/take it one step at a time/just get a job first/don\u2019t compare yourself to others/blah blah BLAH motivational advice.

To live and love.\n\n\n\n   \u201cI thought about making this all flowery and poetic, but soon realized how ugly that is. I\u2019m not going to dance around this and instead just get to it. I killed myself. Not sure how I did it, but I did (there were a lot of different methods floating around at different times so it\u2019s a roll of the dice). It\u2019s just that nothing was right: my marriage; my ability to be a father to my amazing children; my relationship with my family who is all back home. Everything that I thought mattered to me was broken because of me. I fucked it all up. I was falling apart and I stopped caring about all of it. Or everything else was falling apart and then I stopped caring. I\u2019m not sure, really, all I know is that nothing was right at the end and that I could\u2019ve done more about it.\n\n   My marriage was broken long before I took the last step. It seemed like things, at certain times, could\u2019ve gotten better but they never did. It just felt like our love got more pointless as time grew. I\u2019m not blaming A. She may disagree and say this is all of her fault, or she may simply not care that this has happened, or she\u2019ll be glad that I\u2019m finally gone and now she\u2019s free. What I am sure of is that this toxic need for each other\u2019s approval (and seemingly simultaneous utter disregard for each other\u2019s feelings) was the beginning of the end. I always could\u2019ve helped but I only ever drove bigger wedges between us. You tried to fix this, to fix us, to fix me. Because I was broken. I recognize that effort and I only ever pushed and shoved. I\u2019m sorry, A. You always deserved better and I knew that all along. I love you.\n\n   Then I had children. First was E and it always seemed like she never wanted anything to do with me. At least, at first. She cried and cried and just wouldn\u2019t stop crying. But only when I was holding her. As soon as A got her hands on E, my baby would calm right down. It\u2019s hard not to take that personally. Eventually this phase passed and I understood that E really did love me. And that was the greatest feeling ever. But when A and I realized how smart and capable E was, I developed these unreal expectations for a mere baby, a toddler, a little girl. I can\u2019t tell you why I needed her to pay attention all of the time, to follow every order I gave her, to be omnisciently aware of my expectations concerning her behavior. But I expected too much. I was hard on her and I yelled all of the time for every little mess up. But she\u2019s just a fucking baby. My baby. I\u2019m sorry, E. No matter how it ever seemed, you never disappointed me and in no world could you ever fall short. I love you.\n\n   M came second. He was a blessing in disguise. An unplanned pregnancy donned barely four months after E\u2019s arrival. It seemed like my family was growing so fast. It was really, but I just couldn\u2019t ever wrap my head around the fact that I\u2019m a father. I\u2019m responsible for ensuring that these little people, my little people, would grow up to become respectable and mature adults. But there was a problem, worse with M. He cried. All of the time, tears were shed. Again, M never wanted me, only ever craved A\u2019s warmth. Not my cold heart. M just cried all of the time though, never stopping. Was it colic? Was it his food? Was he eating enough? Was he not getting changed enough? But this was happening for a second time; first with E and now M. I was sure of it; it couldn\u2019t be anything else. Was it me? Yes. M will grow up fine. He won\u2019t really remember me. He can do better without me glaring at him, waiting for his mommy to comfort him. I\u2019m sorry, M. You won\u2019t ever really know why I need to be sorry, but I am. I failed you. I failed at being a strong enough man for you. No matter what happens to you in your life, just know that you\u2019ll always be man enough for me. No matter how much you cry. I love you.\n\n   Mom and dad. The wonder team. Perfect under pressure and discreet about their problems. I could never amount to much when my idols were always leagues above me. Through all of the fucked up stuff I\u2019ve done: Poor choices and shortcomings; disappointments and failures. You guys always put your bet on me rising to the top. How is it that no matter how much I slipped, you guys were there to pick me right back up? That\u2019s just crazy. Unfathomable support. I couldn\u2019t have asked for better parents because you two always did what you thought was best for me. And it all was. I couldn\u2019t praise you more for all of the effort and love put my way. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry to fail you again despite the time you both dedicated to me. But you guys won\u2019t blame me, you never did. Just please, for fucks sake, don\u2019t blame anybody for this. Especially not yourselves. This is all me. I love you both.\n\n   My family. My sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents. My family that\u2019s back home. The family that\u2019s no longer with us. Mourning over losses that I could never be there for. Hey, it turns out that I could\u2019ve been home for Grandpa and Grandma\u2019s funeral. Both of them. It wasn\u2019t because of work. It was because I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t want to see them in a box. I didn\u2019t want to see the rest of us crying, breaking more every day. Trying to act strong, but all growing apart. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of this process. But that\u2019s selfish of me. I didn\u2019t want to be there for my own family, and that\u2019s fucked up. Family is the most important thing in the world to me and I can\u2019t imagine a situation where it isn\u2019t. So I didn\u2019t come home where we were all fighting and cracking under pressure. That\u2019s unreal to me. The irony of my own feelings: I didn\u2019t want to be separated from my family by force, so I separated myself from my family by choice. I\u2019m sorry to everybody who took this as me not caring. That\u2019s not what I wanted at all. What I wanted is for everybody to be okay, but I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t fix anything. I can\u2019t make anything right. Ever. And nobody else can either, so the only thing we can do is depend on each other instead of fighting. I love all of you.\n\n   I\u2019m sorry for everything. It\u2019s so important to me that nobody blames themselves. I love you all so much and I wish I would\u2019ve tried before it was too late to matter. Never forget the importance of family, of love, of each other.\u201d",

Since I\u2019m gay and he\u2019s straight, I always knew nothing would come out of it, but is it really that easy to just get over someone? My feelings ended up growing a lot, and affected our friendship, but luckily we\u2019ve worked things out and talk time from time. Yet I still recall times in highschool that were so hard and I can\u2019t remember ever being happy. \n\nNow it\u2019s happening again, with someone else. I started having feelings for one of my housemates in October of last year, and I told myself to stop things from getting worse. It worked for a bit, but then we starter getting closer and closer, and it got to the point that I constantly wait for him to get home or get jealous when he hangs out with other people (this seems toxic to me, and I already feel bad for acting this way). He recently revealed to me that he started catching feelings for a friend of his, and I immediately returned to how I felt in high school. I felt hopeless, alone, and forgotten, all because I knew that his feelings weren\u2019t one-sided. This ended up being true. Last night he went out with said friend and they ended up admitting to each other that they like each other. (writing that broke me). I told him that I really am happy for him (I truly am), but that I\u2019m sad that we won\u2019t be hanging out as much. He reassured me that that won\u2019t be the case, but come on, honeymoon phases are no joke, and now I\u2019m going to be the only single person in my apartment, with no one to go to anymore. Being gay in an apartment full of straight guys is hard already, but not being able to spill my thoughts about my crush on my housemate makes it even harder.\n\nI texted my bestfriends from back home, and I really do appreciate their love and support, but I h a t e the toxic positivity. \u201cThere\u2019s so many fish in the sea! The right one will come.\u201d This makes me think of other sayings, \u201call things happen for a reason; it wasn\u2019t meant to be\u201d. All these sayings just make me even more upset. Was I meant to be unhappy? Am I supposed to be hurt again and again? If there\u2019s \u201cso many fish in the sea\u201d, why hasn\u2019t one found me? Like I said, I really appreciate the thought, but it doesn\u2019t help. It just makes me feel as though I will always be in this position, and never be happy.",

        "selftext": "I have had enough and I don\u2019t know how much longer i can withstand this. Hi, I am 19 years old, and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. My life was amazing till i reached 10 years old. I was living with my family that consisted of my parents and my younger brother. It was an amazing period where people loved me, especially my mother. Unfortunately, my mother has Alzheimer now, and not just any Alzheimer. Long story short, she can\u2019t remember who any of us are and is bed bound and in need of 24/7 attention. In these last 9 years, things became very very difficult and different. My father got very lonely because his wife is basically gone. He had no one to comfort him nor anyone to sit with him. Even when i was young, my younger brother was much smarter than me and more handsome and loved by both my parents. Even if my dad use to call me useless and a waste of space, my mother would always comfort me bu hugging me and telling me to ignore what my father says. Well that lasted till she became sick and fell. When i was 13, my father got mad and just went ahead and married someone else. He bought a house and everything and is living his life. Anyway, i have been trying to tale care of my mother as I literally have to do everything for ( as it is a pleasure for me because she suffered 9 months and went through pregnancy and raising 2 kids, so no matter what i do, nothing will repay my debt to my mother). My father still hates me as I didn\u2019t turn out like he wanted me to be. He keeps calling me worthless and i try to find new ways to become better for him. I just want to see him smile at me, even if its just once. My brother has sided with my dad, and blames me for everything bad that happened to him. He is still my younger brother, i will always try to protect him and care for him no matter what. I attend my university classes online, and care for my mother at the same time. I take my brother to school and hire a care taker for the time i am out of the house to watch out for my mom. I have barely gotten any sleep these past years and my family members are not making it any easier for me. I started selling everything i owned to pay for my brothers expenses so he doesn\u2019t feel like no one is taking care of us. Every month, i sell what i can to make enough money to hire a care taker and to let my brother live as much as a childhood as he can. Since I didn\u2019t really have much of a childhood, i would still like my brother to have an amazing time. I recently discovered selling organs as i ran out of things to sell, and i sold my kidney and made decent money. I think i have to quit university and get a job as no one is looking out for my brother and mother. My father visits us from time to time and gives my brother the fatest hug ever. When i go to say hi to him, all i get is \u201c be useful and go make me some tea, and after you finish, come rub my feet and wash my car outside\u201d. I say yes sir and go do everything he tells me, hoping to tell me i am proud of you or thank you or even just smile at me for once. I started washing cars when i could to make money to buy food and water. I sold everything in my room, like my bed and cabinets and all the furniture in my room and bought a sleeping bag, and a dusty old pillow i found. But I can\u2019t do this anymore, my back is starting ti crumble and my heart is starting to hurt. I did everything I possibly can to make my brother happy, but all i get in return from my brother and father is them spitting on me for not being good enough. I did put my organs and body up for sale for after i die, and the inheritance will be transferred to my father. That way, he can be happy and hopefully i can get a smile out of him for something i did. I am this close to loosing it, and i just want to make people happy. I don\u2019t care about my condition or my mental state or even my health. As long as my family, especially my mother, is safe and healthy, i am happy. Even if i get spat on daily, and disrespected daily. To my father and brother\u201d I deeply apologize for not being good enough. I hope now by leaving, i am not bothering you in any way and wasting your time and money. Thank you for everything you have done and i hope you live an amazing prosperous life. I am sorry father, for wasting your time, money and energy, i hope my donation helps you out. I will finally get the rest I deserve and see you on the other side\u201d.",

I don't truly contemplate killing myself. Well I did once, but most of the time it's not plotting how to do it, it's more thinking about what it would be like if I were gone. Would anyone really even care? I know my mom and my husband would, but I'd be easily replaced and since time heals all wounds, not long before I'm forgotten. I'm at the point of being too depressed to do anything about it. Thankfully spring is coming and that always helps but it won't be long until the cycle is back.\n\nI think for me I miss connection to people. I used to have a good group of friends but things changed and it kind of fell apart. I reached out to one last year and we went and had a couples date and brunch. Thought we would reconnect but it didn't stick. He never reached out again. Haven't heard from him in over a year. Granted, COVID. But we connected in January and there was two months before the lock down. I don't have the desire to reach out to people anymore because I feel like it's me doing all the reaching. Maybe they don't really like me and I'm that person in the group everyone wishes would just go away. Well, they got their wish.\n\nNow I have no real friends. No one ever reaches out to me. I just feel so alone. Sometimes that's fine, I'm independent, I'm ok with alone time. But then it gets to the point where I realize how really friendless I am and it starts to...hurt? It's not even a hurt, it's like an emptiness. Sometimes I think I should just own it. Give it all up, move to Alaska (why Alaska I don't know) and be a hermit. Give up the expectation that I should even have friends or connections with others. Maybe that would work.\n\nEnd vent",

He is older than me lives in another country and is deeply depressed bc he doesn't have any support in his country not even family and he hasn't had that in 10+ he is giving up and tbh mid quarantine i was too. We engaged the deepest and best friendship i have had in my whole life, it was hard, bc he needed me lots and i need it him, we watched movies at the same time, whole vikings, peaky blinders, all of that stuff, phone call till we fell sleep everyday. \n\nThen i went to a party and he saw my stories and thought he was replaced, he felt bad, but none of those people where really my friends he is. Any ways he is more depressed now and has been going down hill since November last year or even before that, i went through the worst year of my life and thought about suicide many times this year and last year. I'm going to the psychiatrist. \n\nBut i send him messages every day, asking him if he is fine, he is not, we don't talk anymore bc he is working and tired and can't sleep, he has 6 hours more than I do. And i just don't know how to help, he doesn't want to go to therapy o meds bc he has tried that before, and the only way he seems to think he is going to recover is if he finds a friend irl which it's unlikely bc mental health. I just don't know what to do, he is my best friend, even if we don't talk like we used to ( or if he doesn't answer) i keep sending him messages almost everyday bc i think someday he may notice that someone really deeply cares about him. \n\nSometimes I'm afraid when he stops answering for a day bc i think he gave up. It messes up with my mental health too, i think i lost the only person that was my friend and actually didn't had any other intention behind.\n\nHow can you help someone that is sad when you are too...",

To start off I used to be a joyful introverted kid who was always happy and running around with a smile on his face. It's been five years and so much has happened, I think to myself all the time what caused me to change, but i never once thought how can I fix myself. I just accepted the way I felt and moved forward without second thought, I never looked back. Nothing traumatic has happened to me either, I'm not around people who would influence me in a bad way my family is always cheerful and loving to me and try their best to cheer me up. \n\nCurrently I'm 14, 8th grade with a somewhat decent life. Most commonly kids my age don't have a full understanding of their own emotions and i would like to think I'm just mixing something up and I'm in the wrong, but this feeling I've been getting lately is very certain towards me. From a young age I've always thought life was sunshine and rainbows and I was certain to get what I wanted, but man I was mistaken. Life for me was quite the roller coaster indeed having my ups and downs, I never once thought I would lose so many things close to me. It's crazy to think this world is so cruel and evil and will take anything you let go of without hesitation, is this world really full of pain, suffering and regret are we only alive to experience such feelings? Will such pain and suffering ever leave? Why does everything I dearly love and hold close have to vanish once I get comfortable? Why does it have to be me?\n\nI don't like this change, I want the old me back, I want my friends back, I want my grandpa back, I want my life of joy back,  I want to feel happy, I want to experience love, Why cant I win in the end? I haven't cried in the past 5 years man, I'm 14 why does this have to happen to me, I haven't had a genuine friendship ,I haven't had someone to talk to, my academics is falling, my motivation for my future career is fading and day by day I'm becoming more distant from society and my humanity. It feels like I'm such a dick to everyone I backstab people I betray peoples trust I manipulate people for my success, I end friendships. I don't intend on doing this, its like I lost my self conscious, I never think before I perform such actions I never reflect on my trouble and I never feel sorry for others, I'm beginning to find enjoyment in hurting others, I'm reckless, It's like I turned my back on society, I turned my back on my family. It really almost feels like I'm alone in this world, but during all this when I'm alone I feel most at peace, I stop thinking, I can relax, most of all it feels like I'm at the top of the world for once I feel like vie done something successful, but what has this feeling cost me? I'm not suicidal but I think about death rather a lot, how its rather peaceful, quick and easy, and will solve my problems.  \n\nI really need help, vie tried talking to my parents and its never any help they don't understand me and i don't want them to worry about me, school counselors aren't even worth the time they just tell me lies and expect me to be happy in a instant, vie had one friend who stocked by my side and has the only person I can talk too and he'll have somewhat of a understanding but still he feels so distant. The thing is I just don't understand is how can I say all this but in reality I don't feel anything, why do I feel heartless, and ruthless why cant I laugh or cry or smile or grin, why cant I talk with people as much, why does this world hate me, I try crying just to see if that would help but its useless no matter how hard i try. Why am I surrounded by people but feel so far away, why am I always thinking evil thoughts. There's so much in this world I have to do, there's promises I made that I have to full fill, I have a family I have to take care of, I have parents I need to retire but why... why cant I do any of it, why cant I be useful to someone, am I to weak? Surely this cant be how I live my life right? Why do the weak suffer and die off while the strong succeed? \n\nIf someone can just tell me why I'm here, why I'm suffering, why it has to be me and don't feed me lies tell me the truth, please I'm desperate as ever, I have people to make proud",

I\u2019m thirty and I can\u2019t leave my house and I spend all my time wanting to die or wanting to know what was so wrong with me that I somehow deserved this like my older sister said I did. I don\u2019t know if this is too much backstory or not, but my PTSD and PMDD have both been really bad the last couple of months, even though I\u2019ve been trying my best to eat and take all my meds and go outside and stuff, and I\u2019ve been dealing with this by not talking to my mom.

I hope all the time I get killed or something happens that I just die immediately. \n\nIdk why I\u2019m writing this... I don\u2019t often post anywhere here.

Most have said they can see what they can do and they would get back to me..but I already knew the answer so I gave upon them.

But that narrows it down to like almost no one(most have families or don't live near me so it's out of the question),a hotel, or a shelter. I know it's not a big deal and I'll eventually figure it out but I can't help but feel like absoult crap about this.\n\n\nAnother thing thats really bugging me and that I hate about myself is I tend to embarrass myself and others by saying way to much. Im not good with words and how I say things...\u00a0I overthink way to much..try to fix things with people and yeah sooner or later people just don't want me in their life anymore..sigh...why couldn't I just been born normal to be able to have normal convos with people...\n\nThis is what Anxiety does to me...\n\n\nSigh..

She takes medication for it, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be helping much. Her parents know about her illness, but they\u2019re not supporting her very well.\u00a0\n\nShe often tells me that she\u2019s tired of living and doesn\u2019t want to go on. She doesn\u2019t have any energy to do things or even get out of bed most of the time. She also sends me memes about wanting to die, and I know that it\u2019s her way of venting and telling me how she feels, and it\u2019s better that she does instead of hiding her feelings, but it all makes me very nervous for her. I\u2019m scared that she\u2019ll actually kill herself one day, and I\u2019ll never see her again, I don\u2019t know what I would do if I lost her.\n\nI text her every day, try to tell her that it will get better one day and to not give up, she knows that if she ever wants to talk about anything or vent I\u2019ll always be there for her, but it really doesn\u2019t seem to be helping much.\u00a0\n\nSo, is there anything else I could do or anything I could do better? What would you want your friend to do in that situation? Are there any little things I could do to push her in the right direction? Any advice will be very appreciated.",

As I grew up it only got worse and worse and worse, from yelling and mental to physical- it doesn't mean she didn't have amazing mom moments, and I'm so grateful she got us away from my dad (although sometimes I wish she would have sooner).

It didn't help that she would fill my head with \"your problems are just kid problems, my problems are real adult problems\", \"I'm more stressed/depressed (list of everything she is going through)\", even my trips to mental hospitals and residentials she was telling me how much I was making her suffer through this. And I started getting angry and \"selfish\" but then she got diagnosed with cancer and I hated myself more. She survived without any chemo, just takes the pills. But now, I'm finally trying to cut her out of my life.... the guilt kills me. I really love her but she only makes me worse. She feeds into my cognitive distortions and calls me crazy for going to the mental hospital or therapy when I'm just trying not to kill myself because I see some sort of potential in me. She also gets crazier and crazier and I just can't stand it. \n\n\nI'm not allowed back home but I don't have a \"permanent\" address because the apartment complex I live at doesn't have mail boxes or mailing room, so I only have a po box. I have no choice (unless someone can help with ideas) but to put her address as my permanent. So all my mail and yes my stimmy checks go to her place. I'm basically forced to visit her and hear the guilt tripping.\u00a0 Everytime I cry in the car because she makes me feel bad for existing. I was the reason why my dad started getting violent, I was the reason she had to leave, I am the reason she doesn't want to live, and I will never be as good as her. Everytime. I want it to stop. I am trying so hard to be my own person- I pay for my car in cash right off the lot, insurance, rent, phone, everything. But this emotional Rollercoaster is plating a part in me failing college. I'm on my second year and failing still, covid definitely didn't help. It sucks because I know I'm smart but I'm unmotivated because I feel so helpless. I'm trying, I promise. I'm trying as hard as I can and am can't help but to cry because of the pain I experience while having internal battles with myself to just survive a day or try to figure out what emotion I'm feeling. \n\nMy mom went through a lot too and I know deep down instead she's not a bad mom because I cherish her good moments- so am I a horrible daughter for not dealing with her? She is my only parent afterall. \nAm I just a failure of a person because I can't deal with what life handed me?\nWill this pain ever feel slightly better?\nWill I ever just be better? Allow myself to have a good education, get a good job, and live a happy life.\nI'm not asking for a 6 figure salary, a million dollar car/house..\nI just want to be a little comfortable. I just want to be a little happy.",

This is all due to my grandparents who abused me mentally and emotionally for 19 years. I blame them for how cynical and unstable I am up to this day. Even their son (my dad) invalidates my traumas caused by his parents, and reprimands me for holding on to my anger. I tried explaining to him that my \u201ctrauma\u201d is serious, but it seems that he\u2019s not listening. I am so exhausted of trying to explain my pain, because i know that no one will really understand how much it affects me. \n\n\nNow going back to the story about my toxic grandpa\u2019s passing, I felt a little bit sad upon hearing the news. Not as sad as any regular person would, and I even felt annoyed that it wasn\u2019t my grandma who passed instead. (my grandma is basically the main abuser, while my grandpa was more of an enabler). Now that my grandma is in the hospital, I can\u2019t help but wish that she passes as well. I\u2019m anxious about the idea of her of living with us if she survives, because now she doesn\u2019t have her husband anymore. It\u2019s so hard for me to feel empathetic because I know how she is, and if ever she lives, then it will be more days of discomfort for me and it\u2019s basically like reliving my days of trauma all over again. \n\nI know that I can move out, and cut them off but i don\u2019t want to live apart from my mom, brother, and dog.

She\u2019s become more and more controlling &amp; aggressive with me as the days go by, it\u2019s not fun.\n  My brother who was once my bestfriend doesn\u2019t even speak to me anymore since his manipulative/gold digging girlfriend wants to alienate him from his family. I tried to visit him for two weeks and she said I had to pay rent for those two weeks, be mindful that they had no furniture so I\u2019d be paying 150 just to sleep on an air mattress ever night. When I said no she blocked me and my brothers attitude towards me changed pretty much after that. No one in the family likes her, she embarrasses and disrespects him constantly in front of people. She consistently Disrespects mom and dad, and actively coaches him to \u201chave balls\u201d and ask for ridiculous amounts of money. We\u2019ve all concluded that her intent is to alienate him from his family in order to force his focus on on her.\n I love my brother dearly but the simple fact that he\u2019d cut me off over someone who\u2019s new in his life makes me feel abandoned &amp; taken for granted. We were soooooo close, now he treats me like an old high school classmate in the grocery store.\n      My bestfriend since childhood rarely answers the phone anymore. As of recently she throws the activities of people I\u2019ve cut off from my past in my face &amp; constantly reminds me of their every move. I\u2019m not the type of person to be interested in the whereabouts of anyone I openly dislike..especially if I was the one who took the initiative to distance myself. The thought of keeping up with or lurking on someone I claim not to enjoy is fucking strange. (And not the good type of strange.) I\u2019ve vocalized to her that I\u2019m not a hater Therefore I don\u2019t want to watch this persons moves to judge/criticize them on the phone.\n It\u2019s even stranger since she actively supports this person virtually, despite all of the pain this person caused me in the past She\u2019ll comment supportive things under their pictures and videos while also hitting parties with them. she consistently sends every post to me hoping I\u2019d bash them or comment on them. It\u2019s draining asf...it\u2019s like, I can\u2019t control who you root for buuuut don\u2019t bring it to me if you\u2019re aware we don\u2019t get along. There\u2019s no point. Since I\u2019ve told her that that shit bothers me she still doesn\u2019t respect how I feel. It\u2019s almost like she wants it to affect me, like there\u2019s ill intention \nI tried venting to my guy friend about it but his every response is filled with thirst and desperation. He\u2019ll be like \u201cwell she\u2019s thick so idk\u201d or \u201cyou think she\u2019ll give me a chance?\u201d every conversation. It\u2019s hard talking to me without him thinking with his dick. (He hasn\u2019t had a real connection with the opposite sex in 6 years so he\u2019s become thirstyyyy &amp; a bit shallow)\n     My other friends are just plain boy crazy. One girl calls me everyday to cry about a guy who isn\u2019t her boyfriend \u201ccheating\u201d on her...and if I\u2019m at the gym or let her know that I\u2019m doing something else &amp; won\u2019t be able to talk at that moment (not dropping everything the moment I get her call) she hangs up in face &amp; ignores me for days...only to call later crying about how she deserves better from this hoelike male.\n My boyfriend hasn\u2019t done anything but be there for me, but I don\u2019t want to be that person who\u2019s only close with their boyfriend \n     I just feel alone. I don\u2019t want to come off as judgmental but when you hear the same thing everyday and continuously being treated like your feeling don\u2019t matter it becomes a lot. I always have this urge to cut everyone off, please say something",

        "selftext": "(Btw guys I\u2019m sorry for the long post, I\u2019ll understand if you don\u2019t want to read it all).\n\n\nHey everyone, this is my first post. And i just feel like sharing this with complete strangers. Cause i just can\u2019t seem to bring it up with everyone i know. Cause everyone can never give me an answer on what to do, and all my friends and people i know always say to not talk about dark thing or negative. All i want is for someone to understand me but for some reason. No one ever does. I feel lost and alone. \n\nI want to kill myself. I imagine myself doing it every single day. I feel like crying but i cant. I cant even feel any sought of emotion anymore. I feel empty, like a husk. No matter how hard i want to find myself and get better. I always find myself doing the exact same thing. Self doubt. Hating myself. And thinking why everybody doesn\u2019t like me. You all might say that not everybody is like that. But even my closest of friends. Or people who i thought to believe eventually changed. And they started looking at me weirdly and not understanding me at all. No one believes in me. \n\nI know its my fault, that it has lead to that. Because i gave up. Another thing i want to point out is why people think I\u2019m lying when I\u2019m telling the truth? I used to brag a lot and exaggerate a lot. But that was 2 yrs ago. And when someone pointed it out. I changed that. Its been years and yet people still don\u2019t trust me.... \n\nBut back onto topic, motivational videos don\u2019t work. Gratitude book doesn\u2019t work. Exercising doesn\u2019t work. Psychologist doesn\u2019t work. \n\nI feel like i have failed myself. I used to be so open, but when people hated that. I stopped. And now when i really, truly want to open up. I can\u2019t I\u2019m afraid, what other people would think of me. Or start a fight with me, because I\u2019m being honest. I feel like. If i were to share my true feelings. And show how i actually feel, people would just straight up put me into a mental institution... idk... its just how i feel. \n\nDo you know when was the last time i got so angry i hurt someone. It was back in primary school, i was in year 4, and i was being bullied by 3 kids. Me and my best mate at the time would constantly get bullied. Day in and day out. Teachers would do nothing. Students would just look the other way. \n\nAnd i got so angry. It was like i was hypnotised. I grabbed this big piece of bark and i was in class, sharpening the bark with the sharp end of the scissors scraping up. It did the job. And I kept it in my pocket. \n\nDon\u2019t know why my teacher didn\u2019t see it.. i was sitting there for like 3 hours sharpening the damn thing. \n\nAnyways i knew that i was going to get bullied by these 3 kids again.  So i prepared myself. And i remembered what my dad said to me once. My military father said \u201cif you ever get bullied don\u2019t ever be afraid to fight back\u201d. But another thing he said to me was to \u201cgo for the kill\u201d. \n\nWhen you tell a kid this. Well what i was thinking at the time. Was that its okay to kill since it was justified. \n\nLunch began. I got attacked. I told them to stop and stay away from me repeatedly. Because I didn\u2019t actually wanted to stab anyone. And the leader said \u201cno we are going to keep doing this, cause its fun\u201d. Then he went to tackle me and in the moment. I thought to myself. \u201cSo be it\u201d. Then grabbed the piece of sharpened bark from my pocket and lodged it straight into the upper centre of his back when it penetrated his skin and touched the spine.\n\nKid was screaming in pain and could not move for a couple minutes. When i was watching all this go down. \n\nSo much emotions flood through me. Regret, guilt, worried, scared, and angry. Not at him. At myself. I hated myself so much and till this day, i still question, if i am even worthy of being a live.  I said to myself that day, That i will never hurt another soul.\n\nThis is just one of the many stories i have, to relate to why i want to die. \n\nThe reason as to why I don\u2019t want to live right now as of this moment. Is that:\n\n1. I can never forgive myself for all the wrongs that i have done. And the feeling that i just cannot understand anyone.\n\n2. I feel like everyone doesn\u2019t trust me, love me, care, believe in me and thinks that I\u2019m unintelligent and a loser.\n\n3. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m attractive at all, so of course I won\u2019t be able to find love in life. \n\n4. I actually do believe that i am unintelligent and that I\u2019m just slow.\n\n5. I constantly behave like a total idiot in front of everyone. I\u2019m pretty sure now that I\u2019m thinking about it. Is because i want people to notice me or pay attention to me. Because i started to realise that people (my friends, or work mates). See me a lot differently now. And for some reason i cannot stop acting like this guy. Cause i know if i stop. Idk. I just need to stop. I keep telling myself that i should just stop talking to everyone and just focus on work or being alone. As much as i want to talk to someone. \n\n6. I also think that people fear me or see me in a criminal way. Idk why i feel like this. I just do. \n\nSorry for just rambling, I\u2019m sure this post is all over the place to. \n\nBut after everything i just said. Yes i do want to take my life. But I can\u2019t, I\u2019m just a coward that can\u2019t kill himself. Tried some things, but just never worked out. I\u2019m afraid of death. And actually knowing what happens once i cross that path. So for years i kept telling myself. Just keep pushing onwards. To keep advancing forward and do not stop. But as time slowly progressed and i am now 23 years old. I say to myself. Why do i still feel like this. \n\nAnyway this is my plan on how to kill myself in the future. Once everything is soughted and i save enough money. I want to travel the world. Cause its always something i want to do. Might as well have some worth in doing something with my life. I do want to help people from other countries and all that. \n\nBut I\u2019m going to take huge risk. Go to dangerous areas and countries. And hopefully bump into someone that will take my life. Since i cannot take my own. I will fight back of course. But if i keep doing this. Than i know that someday. Someone or something will take my life. \n\nI know its weird that I\u2019m doing it this way. But its the only thing i can think of. \n\nI hate myself a lot. And i understand why no one wants me to exist. I understand why my friends and family don\u2019t love me. I understand why I\u2019m such a horrible human being. \n\nI\u2019ve accepted my reality and someday someone or something. Will take my life.\n\nAnyways thanks for reading. I just want to know what people think. Feel free to call me an idiot or stupid or delusional. I just don\u2019t care anymore.\n\nHave a wonderful life everyone. I really do wish that everyone doesn\u2019t end up like me.",

We were never rich to begin with but we were comfortably middle class. Then my parents got a divorce and it just got worse. After I turned 9 my happy childhood was over. Over the past 12 years my life has just gotten worse and worse.\n\nI was never able to have a proper childhood or teenager life. Some of it is because of my own bad decisions like not making friends, getting bad grades since I didn\u2019t care about school, not getting a job, and just being a homebody but some of it is because of my upbringing. Like we were poor but not so poor I couldn\u2019t have my own room but because we moved so much my parent thought it wasn\u2019t necessary for me to have my own space so for most of my childhood after 9 and until I was about 16 almost 17 I had to share a FUCKING BED with my parent!!! Even though there was an extra room (they always converted the extra room into a work office). This also contributed to me not wanting to make friends what teenage girl wants friends coming over to their house when they share a bed with there parent!\n\nAnyway my relationship with my parent also just kept getting worse and worse it\u2019s at the point now where I almost hate them. I go through periods of time where I don\u2019t talk to them because all we do is fight it\u2019s so tiring.\n\nSince I was 19 I\u2019ve began really hating life and myself. I\u2019ve literally done nothing in the past 12 years. I haven\u2019t had a friend since I was 12, I failed high school, I\u2019ve never interacted with a guy let alone had a boyfriend. I can\u2019t even get a fucking part time retail job nobody ever wants to hire me!!!! And I know it\u2019s just going to get harder than it already is.\n\nI\u2019ve come to the point where I\u2019m just fucking angry! I\u2019m angry at life, I\u2019m angry at myself, I\u2019m angry at my family I\u2019m just mad!!!! Why did I have to have such a horrible life why me!!!!??? I\u2019m so FUCKING MAD!!!!\n\nI\u2019m mad that even if I do get a job it\u2019ll be one where I\u2019ll barely make any money and if I want to move out I\u2019d be scraping by barely surviving, and even if in a couple years I got a degree or something all I\u2019ll be doing is working and taking a vacation once or twice a year until I\u2019m 70! Like I\u2019ll never get to be a carefree child or teenager! Those years were taken from me because of my stupidity and because I\u2019m poor!!!!\n\nLiterally the only thing that\u2019s kept me sane over the past like 2 years is living in my head. As I\u2019ve gotten more and more depressed I started creating a fantasy world in my head of my life but \u201cperfect\u201d exactly how I wished it was. That\u2019s pretty much what I do most of my day is lay in bed and go into my \u201cperfect\u201d world. It\u2019s so real and amazing. It\u2019s literally the only happy thing in my life. It\u2019s really the only thing keeping me from killing myself. When the real world gets to painful when I start to think about my pathetic life I just tell myself to calm down and go into my fictional world.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do with my life at this point like I want to kill myself but if I fail what if I end up in a worse situation like I fuck up my wrist or I get brain damage or something!!!! The only thing that would truly make me happy is if I could go back in time 12 years and try to at least do some things better like the problems I caused that got me here. I know my life wouldn\u2019t be perfect but it would be a lot better then now.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone and thanks in advanced for reading.\nSo this is my story, I'll try to mix everything as best as I can so to begin... I (35 male) was raped as a child by an uncle 7 years my senior, I think I was 8 or 9, the trauma made me lock my memories from 2 to 3 years (between the incident and subsequent years). I didn't confront the issue till I was 24 and a girl friend that I used to talk to and sort of wanted something more were talking about our feelings and I just plained told her what had happened to me and she told me that something similar happened to her at a similar age, we cried and talked about it and other things, strangely, as we felt closer after this we went our separate ways being just good friends to this day (she is married, lives in a different country and has a baby), after that I worked through my trauma alone with little success (side note, there is a history of violent tendencies in the men of my family, both from my mother's and father's side, and I'm basically the mixed result). A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together and I was trying to start a nice conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity can't have a future, I wasn't able to tell her that that was what hurt the must, she never apologized, we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didn't confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence (we were together for close to 4 years). So after that and having gotten some more help with my trauma I went on the quest to become the best version of me and was doing ok, over a year after I meet my current wife, a person so beautiful that has made me feel what is real love and allowed me to love freely again, but another kind of problems fell onto us, financial problems. I am an engineer (developer), my family is middle class my father is a pediatrician and my mother is a fisiotherapyst, I also have a sister 4 years my junior and we live in a third world country (Bolivia) so we had enough but never had luxuries, my wife in the other hand had a worst time growing up, her father was a taxi driver and her mother is a school teacher assistant with two more brothers so they were basically poor, with just enough to get by. When we got together we swore to work hard so we can give our selfs and our families a better life than the one we knew. As I mentioned I have anger issues and while I was working one day my boss called me to his office just to yell at me about a complain I presented to management about an issue with my laptop, I used to use my personal laptop to work in the office because they couldn't provide one for me and when it broke I asked them for a replacement, apparently this was out of line for them and he just begun insulting me with my colleagues hearing everything, I almost lost it but kept it together just enough to put myself face to face with him and asking him to repeat everything closing my fist ready to beat the shit out of him, he just stayed silent and I laughed at him and just turned away, a few weeks later I was fired (if you think I should have reported him and the company I did but keep in mind this is Bolivia, there is no justice for anyone who doesn't have money) so until today I haven't been able to get another stable job and we basically just live with the food our families give us and small jobs I got and everything goes to pay the bills, on top of this, about a year and a half into our relationship when we moved in together and a month before getting fired we got a loan from the bank to began a business together and when she was set to go and make a deposit to buy our merchandise her uncle got notice of this and robbed her like a common thief (yeah you read that right), so we went into debt (15.000 USD) with no job and no business, police and family where notified but the scumbag flew the country (to Peru as far a we know). I know I'm mixing a lot but I can't order my thoughts right now. So to continue and to clarify some things, my wife knows about my rape and thanks to her I was able to talk to my sister about it too, needless to say I broke her heart but also made us more closer, she also was kind enough to pay for private professional help for me and her to deal with this, I also opened about this with an uncle (my mother's brother) who I thought was someone completely different to what he turned to be, when I told him about this he broke hard and I took him to talk with the therapist I was seeing thanks to my sister, and what she told me (the therapist) before and told to him later changed everything, she said that I needed some sort of compensation for what had happened in order to move on, it wasn't possible to get legal justice due the time frame of the events and the lack of evidence beyond my word and she didn't suggest anything more beyond that we should try to figure it out, of course telling the whole family was my first thought and let the truth have its day, but my uncle begged me not to tell nothing because it would destroy the family, specially my mother who has a lot, and I mean a lot of love for the uncle who raped me, she (my mother) basically raised him the first 4 years of his life because my uncles had a busy and privileged life and he is seen by the rest of the family as a great guy and an example, with this he convinced me not to tell anything, I know I could have just said no and told everything to everyone but thinking what could I possibly put my mother through after seeing how his brother took the news made me feel trapped and basically I've been living feeling like a prisoner and the responsible for my entire family being together or not... my dear wife, my love, only she keeps me sane holding me when I'm about to broke and unfortunately with all that I've mentioned before about not being able to get a job it has begun to be a frequent occurrence and I can see it is taking a toll on her, I've busted my eyes and my back studying and working hard on small jobs non related to my career just to keep us going and whenever seems to be an opportunity all I get are rejections or I get to watch people getting jobs because of political favors, and what has led me here is the thought that I am the common factor in all of this and everyone, specially my wife would be better of if I am no more, we would love to be able to begin a family but it would be so irresponsible to bring a child to this world under this circumstances, and this also makes my wife so sad, she cries in my shoulder but tells me that we will pass this and everything will be fine, but I've lost almost all hope, and given our age and financial situation it looks that if she keeps being by my side she will never have the family and the life she deserves.\nI think I'll post this in suicide watch as well if it is not against the rules and what I humbly ask of whoever is reading are some words of advice or encouragement or a slap in the face if it is what is needed (not that i haven't got lots of them as well) but I don't know, I'm lost, I'm at the edge.",

It destroyed my relationships and drove my friends away. I am more isolated now then when I first started \"\"Seeking help\"\" .

When I\u2019m covered in open cuts and blood and burns it feels like that how I\u2019m supposed to look.

I\u2019m not someone who fought a tough fight, I\u2019m just someone who\u2019s so weak even their own brain can beat them down because I have no willpower.

Cant stand the thought of losing her coz i cant give her kids\n\nRecently we had a heated debate about marriage and when im going to. Ifor the life of me im trying everything i can but im afraid if my finances and career dont work life dont change i will lose the love of my life not because she's after money but because i cant give her/support a decent life for the both of us. He family and friends all hint and want it to happen but im struggling as is. I want it to happen more than anyone but i cant see to.\n\nLately ive been looking at where i could have gone wrong to end up at such a shitty position in life. I also ask my self if its possible for a 35 year old to turn their life around from literally nothing to earning a decent wage and raising a family. Answer seems to be no, opportunities missed, fear gripped life, a track record of failures, no friends the ones who \"are\" there not willing to guide me\n\nI read books, apply myself as best i can but like a nightmare loop of a life, every day i wake up with the same sensation of underachievement, failure, hopelessness, fear of the end life. Did i not study enough when i was younger? Did i insult the wrong people and develop a horrible personality that turns people away from working with me? \n\nNever had a drinking problem but i stopped drinking 8 years ago did no heavy drugs. Yet i see alcoholics and drug abusers raising families and earning a decent living, with friends and family a constant part of their life. So what have i done wrong? Not so eloquent or knowledgeable people get ahead easier than me...are they more likeable do they know something i dont?\n\nIts taken a lot to learn not to resent  others for their fortunes but at the same time it has left a horrible bitterness and shame towards my own self. One day i tell myself hey dude you got this the next its, hey dude its been fun look around you life goes on without you, decisions are made without your input, friends and family celebrate n your absence anyway so why not end it and leave it all behind?  \n\nI once posted on reddit asking the universe for \"1 good year\" and a random user commented you'll never have it....",

Every time it happens I get hurt but at the same time expect it. Until I met a woman, she's different. She is literally me but of the opposite gender. I enjoy talking to her about random shit, and I legitimately love spending time with her. She lasted waayyy longer than the others, we were talking for 6 months, then all of a sudden it changed. She then started being distant, cold and a bit hostile when we talk. We had this problem before, this is what happens when she is having a problem, the stress and pressure eat her up. The first time it happened, we actually made it through, but barely cause I was holding the relationship up. She said sorry afterwards and promised to be better. After a couple of weeks, family problems rose again, and it fucked her up again. This time it's worse, she actually hinted at a break-up and when she was trying to break up i felt like she was legitimately trying to hurt me. Calling our relationship \"not rare\", \"You tried your best\" , making it seem like she didn't love me anymore, \"you'll meet different people\". Don't get me wrong this isn't the first time a woman has messed me up, but what makes it worse is that I never thought that she would. I never thought that she can do this to me, I loved her with all my heart, constantly supported her and stuck through the times that even she knows she is fucking up.  It hurts cause she made me feel loved, and I felt like she was gonna be it for a long time, cause what we had was truly rare, the foundation of what we have wasn't physical or sexual (though we also find each other hot and attractive), the foundation is genuine fun while talking to one another. I don't know if I can find another woman/connection like that. Guys, I can't sleep, I try to take my head out of it and just give her the space and time she needs (we are currently on a cool off), but everytime I close my eyes or just alone, every hurtful thing she said comes rushing in then comes the good memories that make sadder cause it feels like I am about to lose that person. We promised to make it through to my birthday no matter what, it's my birthday next month.  Guys, I need help. I have been heartbroken before, but this feels way worse and more painful cause the relationship was longer and I never thought that she can do this to me :&lt;",

He said I have traits of Borderline which made a little more sense to me based on my experiences but apparently I don\u2019t even fit a full diagnosis for it according to him because \u201cthose people can\u2019t control their emotions at all and I was polite\u201d.

And then he just shoved some pills on a script and told me to take those. Mood stabilisers and upped my antidepressants. Well the antidepressants don\u2019t do shit and apparently the mood stabiliser could give me an internal rash that could kill me before I knew it was there, could cause me organ failure, or could make me gain a bunch of weight which I guarantee will depress me more than any fucking antidepressant has a chance of fixing.\n\nWhat\u2019s the fucking point of such a fucking worthless treatment system?",

Depression is not hurting, is not loathing, is not a lack of happiness. Depression is a state, a condition, an environment of a person's mind. Depression is a sequential series of episodes of an unending circumstance, interrupted by commercial breaks of actual emotions. Depression is an overwhelming emptiness of life, where nothing truly dwells except you. Life flows and time continues, but there is no flavor to life. There is no excitement in it  nor joy, nor even rage or sorrow. Depression is an ineptitude of emotion and an insufficiency of feeling, and it leads to a further deterioration of the mind, body and soul. Depression is an affliction is subtle in its malady, worming through you, leaving you riddled and barren. A feeling rarely exists past its experience; emotion falls away out of the moment. Life feels lifeless without stimulation, without energy, without motivation, without desire, for what is life without these things? That is depression, the spiritless free fall of lackluster existence, the state of being between emotion and reaction, between the last stimulation of the world and the rebounding starvation that aches from within. From ecstasy to misery, the mind body and soul yearn long and lust for feeling, synthesizing empty emotions to substitute the stimulation, in attempts to reject to state of depression that goes against their nature. This state is where the affliction begins to become septic, subtle but deadly. Addiction, disregard, recklessness, escapism, idealization, death. Starved of stimulation and suffocating from synthetic emotion is how depression ultimately kills. Depression is a state of lifelessness that leads to lifelessness.",

I appear to gain happiness easily, I laugh a lot, I always joke around, but the thing is, I never feel genuine happiness. At that moment, I may feel \"happy\" but the feeling does not last long. I don't know whether it's because I am literally an optimistic person or that I have over-compressed my feeling. Sometimes I become emotionless, I only feel sadness. \n\nThe thing is I want someone to talk to, but who? My friends already got their issues to deal with, my family got their own issues too, it seems like I am only overreacting. I hate to put the burden on my friends as they have experienced things way worse than me. I constantly remind myself I am nobody to mourn my negativity, it is just that I am exaggerating, probably this is only a puberty thing. After all, nobody understands you except yourself, and no one is responsible to listen to the shit you had.\n\nI know my family loves me, I know I have my close friends, but I know I always feel insecure, what if they are all only pretending? What if I don't deserve the love? A lot of the time, (I know this is weird) but I really wish I had fatal disease or depression so people could actually show their love and care to me. I want to be loved genuinely.  I just want someone to actually care for me. \n\nThough to clarify, I never once had any suicidal thoughts, I simply don't have the courage to do so and I think I want to stay on Earth. Now, I often think, why does happiness matter so much? Is it because we have over pursued happiness and that turns us into unhappy persons? \n\nI am no longer the best at school, I can't focus on my studies now, I no longer get recognition from classmates and teachers like I used to, I feel like I am so useless. I am not good at anything, I just feel like I am a piece of trash wasting resources on Earth. \n\nI never dare to cry out loud, I am so afraid to let others hearing me crying. I feel ashamed of crying in front of others, as people may think I am hypocritical, pretentious, being too vulnerable. But I would easily cry just because of some trivial things, nonstop, alone in the dark or in the toilet. I always shed tears before I sleep, sometimes for no reason at all. \n\nI don't know what is wrong with me, though I don't think I have depression (I think I am just overexaggerating things a bit plus I don't have any self-harm thoughts), I just hope someone here has the same feeling as I do. \n\nI know this is so clumsy.

That wasn\u2019t part of the plan. So I didn\u2019t die like I was supposed to and people found out about the attempt and things have only gotten worse. Or maybe I did die and this is hell, don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to tell the difference. Not that I even believe in a hell.\n\nBut everything since that attempt has only gotten worse. The only real friendship I\u2019ve ever had fell apart. Even all the other \u201cfriendships\u201d I had are gone now. I don\u2019t have a job anymore. The jobs I\u2019ve had since then were torture. Had to take a whole company to court for underpaying everyone all by myself, couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer and I was the only one willing to stand up. Only got $6000 for all the trouble and $2000 of that went straight to tax. \n\nMy already shaky relationships with family have deteriorated too, lost my house and had to move back in with my narcissistic mother who, after promising to help me out and get me into therapy, flipped out at the beginning of COVID and ended up kicking me out, forcing my to move houses, broke and jobless. Can\u2019t even drive, only have a learner license and no one to teach me. Don\u2019t know how the hell I avoided homelessness. Then, about 3 months ago, after spending a year of not talking to her at all, I reconnected and stupidly moved back in when I was at risk of losing my house again when I lost my job over the court case. Now I\u2019m living with her again and like a cosmic kick in the balls, my entire state is currently in another huge COVID lockdown and I\u2019m not allowed to leave the house, gyms are closed, she won\u2019t even let me go and buy groceries and I\u2019m just waiting for her to flip out and kick me out again. I know, I\u2019m a fucking idiot and I\u2019ve done this to myself.\n\nI just feel like everything that\u2019s happened since my suicide attempt has been to somehow punish me for not succeeding. I\u2019m supposed to be dead right now. I feel like I\u2019m displaced in time. Even my attempts to make things better only make me feel worse. Almost 2 years of therapy hasn\u2019t done anything to help me, the piles of medications I\u2019ve been through haven\u2019t made any difference, the exercise and healthy diet don\u2019t change anything. I\u2019ve lost the ability to feel excited or hopeful for anything at all, I\u2019ve lost my ability to tolerate people, tried to make new friends but I can\u2019t be around people anymore, can\u2019t connect to anyone if I could. The few good memories I had just contain pain now, bitter reminders of things I don\u2019t/can\u2019t have anymore, things I\u2019ve fucked up. If I had\u2019ve died when I wanted to, I would\u2019ve died with friends, with a job, with money, without self harm scars all over my body.

        "selftext": "Hi. I\u2019m a 29 year old woman who has dealt with depression ever since I was 12 years old. I grew up seeing my dad abuse my mum both physically and mentally. I was born in Scotland but grew up in Ontario, Canada. When I was 11, I was sent over to Scotland by myself to visit some family on my dad\u2019s side (who I hadn\u2019t seen in years). I had to share a bed with my cousin and he molested me the whole month I was there, made fun of my weight and generally made my time a living hell. I hadn\u2019t told my mum for 9 years. When I came back from Scotland I gave up every thing I used to love; football, karate, dance.. Every thing that made me feel somewhat safe was taken away from me. That\u2019s not even the worst part. \n\nWhen I was 13 to 15 I was being sexually abused by my dad\u2019s friends son, I always felt ashamed and embarrassed talking about it. Any time I got feelings of horniness I would touch myself and then feel sick afterwards. I was almost raped at a party when I drank for the first time, my friend tried to rape me and when I went to Cancun for my grade 12 trip, 2 men in their 30s tried to assault me as well. It wasn\u2019t just limited to men either, a woman I used to work with used to sexually harass me when I was 18. I had always been fortunate that I was able to either fight these people off or someone had walked in and scared them off. It seemed like every where I went, someone was trying to hurt me.\n\nI had been cutting myself and pulling my hair out for years. I used to sit on the tracks by my house and wait for a train to come but would get too scared. I tried speaking to someone about it but it never worked. I\u2019ve always felt worthless. \n\nFor a while I felt alright when I first started seeing a guy when I was 20. We were together for 7 years, the first 5 years were great! But his mum died, his drinking began to get out of control and he would start abusing me. He broke my nose, choked me out multiple times where I almost passed out, stomped on my back, kicked me, punched me, fractured my thumb, my eyes were so black it had looked like I had been in a car accident. My hair was constantly falling out, I was a mess. \n\nMy mum, sister and grandparents had moved back to Scotland so they had no idea. My dad and I weren\u2019t close, so he had no idea. And my friends abandoned me because they didn\u2019t like my boyfriend. I felt completely alone. I still feel alone. \n\nFinally one day I broke up with him because I had a seizure from head injuries I had sustained, I moved back to Scotland. I\u2019ve been back for two years now. I just wanted to feel somewhat normal. \n\nI love Scotland, it\u2019s a beautiful country, but because of covid I haven\u2019t been able to meet many people and it\u2019s been really lonely. I have the urge to cut myself again but I always stop myself. I don\u2019t want to speak to a doctor because they\u2019ll just put me on medication. \n\nI want to kill my self, end it all, not feel this way, I\u2019m so tired. I don\u2019t want to live but I\u2019m too scared to die, what kind of a suicidal person is that? \n\nNo one knows how I truly feel. I laugh, I give advice, I cheer people up because I don\u2019t want anyone to feel how I feel. Sorry, just had to vent a little bit. If I say the words out loud, I feel like I may choke.",

        "selftext": "Stuck in my own head recently so I just think and I think and I think. Just end up talking to myself about myself for hours, days even. One of the thoughts I had tonight was a theory about why I feel the need to do certain things.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with certain \u201caddictions\u201d in the past. I put that in quotes because I don\u2019t know if some of them were/are actual addictions or if I\u2019ve just been conditioned to think that (in before some days something about \u201cthe first step is admitting it blah blah blah, I get it, this is probably what an actual addict would claim). \n\nMy self harming I would say was probably an addiction from what I can tell. My alcoholism, on the other hand, I don\u2019t know if that was an addiction. The only real friend I\u2019ve ever had was the one who encouraged me to stop drinking after she found out about my suicide attempt where I drank a full bottle of bourbon, cut myself all up my arm and took a box of sleeping pills. I never meant to tell her but she heard about it it the next day through some crazy circumstances (long story) and we talked about it a little bit and she told me she wanted me to stop drinking, for good reason obviously. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d say I was addicted to alcohol, I did drink a fair bit and this wasn\u2019t the first night I\u2019d polished off a whole bottle by myself but I think the main reason I view it as a possible addiction is because she asked me to stop. But most of the time it\u2019s pretty easy to not drink.\n\nBut anyway, all that aside I\u2019m starting to notice that my addictions or whatever you wanna call them hard the hardest to resist when I\u2019m thinking about having these kinda movie moments. It\u2019s kinda hard to explain but it\u2019s like I just think about the emotional state I\u2019m in or some event that\u2019s triggered me and I sometimes picture myself in a sort of movie scene, something I\u2019d imagine you\u2019d see if a main character went through what I just did and it\u2019s the scene that shows them processing that or whatever. \n\nAn example would be in the show Lucifer, when Lucifer is sitting on the beach smoking with his wings on the ground behind him. Or any time BoJack goes on a bender in BoJack Horseman, scenes like that. It\u2019s like the only way I know how to process my emotions is by creating one of these moments for myself in real life. I have to put on some music and sit on a beach at night, with a glass of whiskey in my hand, or go to a club and get lost in a drug-fuelled montage, or stand on the roof of a high rise in the middle of the city and smoke. I don\u2019t know why this is.\n\nBut the urge to create these moments for myself is the main thing that pushes me to want to drink or smoke or do drugs or self-harm. There are just some settings or some feeling that feel wrong without the accompanying vice. Even things like the type of alcohol changes, sometimes a straight glass of whiskey, neat. Sometimes it\u2019s beer. Sometimes it\u2019s vodka straight from the bottle. Other times it\u2019s cocktails. I don\u2019t have a preference of my own, only what fits the moment I feel like I need to have.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I do this. I\u2019ve thought maybe it\u2019s because I want people to see me a certain way, and maybe it is to some extent, but almost every time I do it I\u2019m alone. Although I guess in the movies they always start alone and sometimes somebody will walk up to them. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do with this information, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better for me to ignore these urges to create the Hollywood moments even though, sometimes they actually make me feel a little better and nothing else helps with that, or if I should give into them when they happen, take it as a sign that I need to process and allow myself to break my sober streak. Hell, I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019ve still got a sober streak, the only people that cared about me getting clean are gone now. Guess it\u2019s just force of habit at this point. \n\nAnyways, don\u2019t know why I decided to post about this but it\u2019s something I noticed and thought was weird.",

I\u2019m aware these thoughts are twisted, demonic, disgusting, degenerate, and that I should be hung and beheaded for feeling this way. It\u2019s evil, it feels like Satan has corrupted me with some kind of a sick disease because it feels like homosexuality is a mental illness and a sick disease. Homosexuality leads to pedophilia and beasitality and I don\u2019t want to make society and the generations that are coming after me suffer because of my sick thoughts. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do everyone, I need prayers. I want to be cured of this sickness and I want to live life with a woman and have a family and I feel like it\u2019s possible as these thoughts were never really prominent before and have only been around for a year (I\u2019m 15). I don\u2019t watch pornography, it\u2019s degenerate filth and I\u2019m aware it alters your mind and I haven\u2019t been abused or gone through childhood trauma so my homosexuality isn\u2019t because of that. \n\nEveryone, even if they don\u2019t admit it are disgusted and repulsed by homosexuals. Homosexuals are inferior to society and it is unnatural for a man to lay with another man, humans are naturally repulsed by homosexuals. Homosexuals are shamed in public and behind closed doors, people stare, point, and laugh. Homosexuals are out of place freaks that are mentally ill and corrupted in a society not meant for them. Homosexuals have no place in society. Normalization of sodomy always comes before the falls of society and always leads to MORE acceptance of more freakish activities. \n\nIf possible and all hope is lost, I will just live my life alone, I refuse to give into this sick fetish, but I know since I\u2019m still young, I can change for the better. Can anyone help me? I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m incredibly desperate and I can\u2019t take living with these thoughts anymore. I can\u2019t do it.

Winter semester finished fine but spring semester was hell. Every teacher got very extreme and started new methods of examing. I had 9 lectures and each lecture had assignments, homeworks, quizes and project. I was so tired, exhausted. No one to reach out. Yes i was lockdowned with my family but it was even more stressfull living with 6 people. I am not mad at my family but i did not have a room. Every professor had zero mercy and empathy, I failed one class, almost failed othrr 2 but passed still. I applied for a summer internship, 25 companies, maybe even more, not one accepted. Semester finished and I havent been socialised for 1.5 year. One and a half year havent seen my friends, one and half year lockdowned, furthest I went was the market down the block. Now the semesrer finished and restrictions eased, I am still home. None of my friends calls or text. They do not even reply my text after 4 5 hours. They only message me when they need help on english or math assignments. I am in the house all day just scrolling through tiktok, instagram, reddit. Not to forget my masturbation addiction.

Seems to me that if you do get something good, you\u2019re more likely than not to just lose it and leave you feeling worse than you ever have before.\n\nMy memories have become a minefield, stepping into any one of them is destructive for me. My brain has become my own personal circle of hell.",

I have tried every drug under the sun with a few notable exceptions. I've been hearing a lot about the magic of drugs like ketamine and psilocybin. Nothing has worked for me so far so it's not like I have much hope, but I'd still like to give those drugs a try. To be clear I have never had a drug dealer friend, I don't have friends that might know someone. To be honest I'm freaked out about looking. I am a very boring and isolated person. Besides I'd love to be able to try these things safely monitored by a doctor, and without the threat of legal ramifications. I can not afford to pay out of pocket for the three places in the country that offer this stuff and my insurance won't cover anything less generic then sunlight and positivity. So my only hope is a drug trial. I'll take the 50/50 odds that I'm only getting the placebo. Every dam time I try to get into a drug trial I am disqualified for random reasons. I have to be under or over a certain age, or I have to have tried x drugs within a certain time frame, or I have the wrong star sign, or the tea leaves say no, or because ancient prophecy forbids it, etc. I have tried to meet criteria, I have tried drugs that I already know make me feel worse just so I could meet the stupid criteria, and every dam time I come across a wall. Sorry...try again when these drugs are mayyyybe like... more approved of in ten to fifteen years. \n\nSo yea who do I have to literally fuck? If someone could just point me in the direction of the individual or individuals who I will be required to fuck to get into a drug trial I'd appreciate it. Whatever gender, age, or orientation, I am prepared! There is no level of debauchery I am not prepared to undertake. Be it butt stuff, group stuff, puke, shit, you name it. I can play dead, dress up in a fur suit, do my little pony cosplay. Whatever they are into I will provide, provided it gets me into a goddam trial where I can try one of these dam miracle drugs that probably won't work in the end anyway. But holy fucking shit have I exhausted all recourse. Is getting this shit the regular illegal way really the only option the medical world will allow me? What horrible crime did I commit? Fucking why? I just want some fucking relief. Is there any physician out there with access who cares? \n\nSo yea, barring that I am prepared to get my freak on.

Yesterday I had a panic attack when I suddenly remembered being severely bullied in school due to me being overweight . I remembered those dirty smirks even girls enjoyed that horrible behaviour . The teachers I asked help for said I was the problem . I don't remember having a single friend from there . At home things are even more hostile , my parents hate each other and have been constantly fighting since when I was 10 or 11 . My mother has narcissistic personality disorder and she manipulates me each day so that her personal wishes are fulfilled . Obviously she doesn't know that she suffers from such condition she belives she is the most righteous human on earth !!!! . Ever since covid broke out I have been stuck to live at home with them . Therefore I am losing my mind slowly but gradually . I don't know what is happiness anymore . I mindlessly watch hours of youtube just to numb the pain and also have been addicted to masturbating . These days if I can laugh I feel blessed , I can only fond minimum solace in music . Forget the dreams , forget the passion living life is a struggle each day .  I have no sense of identity and my sexuality as well . I can also remember painful experiences where other boys used to touch me inappropriately objectifying my chest fat . I don't know if I will survive in f I will feel happiness ever . During these times I also have contemplated suicide but nah can't do I love myself to not cause physical harm . But I can absolutely asure you I had access to any weapon when I was being bullied for 6 years in school I would have killed them all . No remorse , why should I allow myself when those motherfuckers never hesitated to trouble me . Due to all this I feel like I don't have any personality I can't attract girls as much as anybody else . I don't I am just STAGNATED . I feel like I can stay here forever . Also I am currently studying engineering here which is the most mediocre thing you can do . I don't know I said yes coz my father wanted that . I love him he does everything to hold the family together , my mother she doesn't care about me never have . She wishes I was an orphan or met an accident since I refuse her authority . I don't If I have really existed ever at all . So days go by I think the least I am grateful about that I woke up the next day !!!",

        "selftext": "A lot of my depression and anxiety comes from the belief that I'm being constantly tormented by an evil spirit or a ghost. These spirits do things to get me angry and just make me want to give up all hope. I just wonder if any of my friends out here on this Reddit ever feel the same way. I feel like I'm completely alone on this matter. I have in the past mentioned it to various therapist or doctors and they all look at me like I crazier than I am. So I stopped talking about it at all with anybody except my poor wife. The torment that I feel I suffer can be described like this. It will hide things that I'm looking for so that I can't find them and then they'll reappear where I looked for him sometime later. Case in point I sent my glasses case on a chair arm and went about my business and came back to pick them up and they were gone. Later on when my wife got home she found him in a different part of the house right in front of her. I know this sounds really stupid as it could be easily explained as being absent-minded but it causes me so much agony Time after Time. Everybody on this Reddit has depression and anxiety affect them in different ways or is triggered by different things. Is absent-minded as this sounds, to me is deadly serious because I'm so tired of constantly being beat down that I don't know how much more I can take of this. That's why I'm reaching out. I have found that the people on this Reddit are much more knowledgeable and understanding then so called normal people out in the world. Thanks for listening to my rant.",

A couple years later (pretty recently) we started hanging out again and have been thinking about dating but some things came up that are too complicated to even try to explain. She also works with me but she might transfer to a different location of the company (still in the same city). But if she leaves the store I work at then I feel like I'll probably just quit. I think she might have been the reason for me staying at this job so long. I don't know, I am just not ready for half of my life to fall apart. I want help (definitely not making enough to afford a therapist) but I just don't know what to do. I want to be happy and finish school and marry this girl but it feels like every day the odds of any of that keep thinning out.

Yesterday I was feeling really bad, and then I received the news that my dad died in a work-related accident. We were very very close, yet we had had a disagreement because of my stepmom always being overly possessive and hating that he treated me the same as the kids they have together. I know that at some point of our last conversation I told him I loved him to death, yet I know he was very distressed because of our situations. I didn't answer his last text, I was still angry and proud. I feel like shit, I would give anything to just have replied \"I love you\" I told him that every time, why couldn't I just do it that last time?\n\nI was dealing with my mental health issues, he was very worried and kept trying so much that I didn't hurt myself. Now I just can't, I can't see myself in a world were he's no longer here. No treatment, therapy or pill will ever fix this.

I have a wife and 2 children that I love more than anything in the world and don't want to leave them. At the same time I don't want to bring my family down because of my depression. I hate myself so much and don't know how to cope with my depression because no matter what it comes back into my head that I don't belong here on earth,  and everybody would be better off without me around. That in my head every day every second gets to a person.  I don't want to die I want to see my family grow, and I want to accomplish so much more in life but I feel as though I can't. I'm sitting in my bathroom right now just shaking because my mind is telling me to let go but my heart is telling me otherwise thankfully but as time rolls on my heart gets weaker and more tired.

I can barely get up to cook food for myself... A year has gone by since they told my therapists they were completely invested in my recovery, then proceeded to avoid everything related to my recovery. My therapists are also letting go of me little by little. I guess it's understandable. Mother's day is coming up and I honestly just wish I could tell her she didn't \"win\" any prize this year but my father insisted on getting her gifts. My closest friend is going through a really rough time as well so I can't talk to her because I'm afraid of making her feel worse - she has attempted suicide before. I know so many people but they're only acquaintances that I avoid because being all jolly and social drains what's left of my energy. So tired of acting for others... I spend my days just wanting to crawl down into a hole and stay awake during the night when it's quieter. The only thing that's keeping me going is wanting to be good to myself by avoiding a painful death. Knowing when you're going to die must be such a relief...

And recently i went to another, this time i thought she was doing a bit better - taking more proper tests and all, and yesterday was the second visit, she asked me how i feel. I said I dont feel any different, actually a bit worse than before. Then hesitated to talk. I wanted to talk, but it just didnt came out. I thought she maybe would mention the test results i took last week, *but* *NO*, after a short silence, she just said \"well then, let's double the meds, and we'll meet later\"\n\nIt was HORRIBLE. I already know I'm a deplorable moron, but just getting passed by was unexpected. This always got me into trouble. i was in a very abusive family. whenever they didnt like what i was doing, mainly behavior/grades - they're one of them stereotypical asian parents - i'd get beaten, alot. sometimes just not telling them what's up would get me a hard beating(\"why won't you fucking spit out?\"), etc. much more to say(bullied at school/church, etc.), but let's skip that. Worst part, it still haunts me to this day, i keep thinking about it when i should be working on my portfolio and applying here and there. but instead im just sitting in my room, just hitting and hating myself, knowing i shouldnt be doing this and shape up, but i should just fucking kill myself for not doing it. \n\n...wasnt really how i was trying to write but guess i didnt know how to wrap it up. also the reason i really couldnt say anything when some ppl around actually did offered me to tell them so they could help me or whatever. :sigh:",

Whether it be my trip to Sri Lanka during which I was criticized by every Sri Lankan I met regarding my weight (I am overweight) or my mother's birthday during which I was worried about all the procrastination that I did on my thesis and how I should be working on it.\n\nIN SHORT, THE SADDEST IS NOT BELIEVING THAT YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY. THIS IS THE WORST BECAUSE NOTHING MATTERS AT THAT POINT. EVEN IF YOU GET THAT JOB AND YOUR BOYFRIEND BECOMES INFATUATED WITH YOUR PHYSIQUE YOU WILL STILL FIND SOMETHING MAJOR MISSING IN YOU.\n\nIf I want cognitive restructuring and psycho-education I would refer to somewhere else. I just want to feel less alone so if you can share your own story of self dissilusionment I believe that would help all of us feel less alone.",

I mean idk really nothing is exciting to me because of depression, but something about being with others just isn't fun. I'd rather be drawing. So that's what I'm going to do.

I've been so quiet this first week at college and I absolutely love this. I love this sort of persona. I feel like I can truly be myself when I'm like this. I'm quiet right now and for some reason I love it to death. I think I might just be myself and stick to this. Because for the past few years I feel like I was sacrificing myself to do something I didn't think was particularly exciting.

I really want to though. Makes me envy other artists like musicians. Do I get fucking jealous of musicians. They can create whatever music they want and sing about whatever they wish and they can at least make a little money off of it, if not make a full time living. If I produce even a little bit of art that I want to make then it's pretty much a guarantee I won't make anything. If I try to do it full time then fuck me I guess I won't make a dime probably. It really sucks being someone who draws. Even if you want to work for a company you probably won't make enough of a living anyway. I really wish I was never interested in art.

Last night my roommate asked me to come to a party and I got really drunk I hated it there all these kids holding their beers and somehow enjoying themselves. After the cops shut it down me and the group I came with who I only knew about three of them went to the town and split up. Now I was at a pizza place with two girls and two guys I didn\u2019t know. I guess they could tell I was really out of it and thought it would be funny to fuck with me so they all just kept lying about everything we were talking about (where they were from, their names, what they were studying and what classes they were in) and when I caught on I felt like everything in the world was fake and I didn\u2019t know anything; these kids I had been talking to and hanging out with all night somehow made a pact to fuck with me completely. And the thing is if I were one of them and saw this drunk little freak with me I would do the same thing out of amusing myself. Anyways when we got on campus I was getting mad that the two girls kept lying to me and when they got defensive I cursed them out and they used that as a way to walk away and make me look like a freak. The two guys still kept walking with me and assuring me the girls were shitty but they were now being \u201creal\u201d with me and liked me and all that shit. Then I find out all this shit about them that made me unable to trust anything they said all night and shoved one of them and wanted to fight them, or just get beat up. I just kept shouting at the and cursing and calling them phonies and was crying like shit. Sorry for the rant. Anyways remember how I told I made friends but now they think I\u2019m shitty. Well we were hanging out for a while in a short time period, it\u2019s these two girls and one guy and I really liked them. But the other night when we were drinking and just ducking around I said something that they took a very wrong way and I don\u2019t completely blame them but I realized they were not texting me anymore or wanted to hang out recently so I texted one of the girls asking her if I did something and after explaining in a very very long text trying to tell her so that she wouldn\u2019t be mad at me but I could tell she was still really uncomfortable and my other two friends (one being her roommate) also felt that way. Now I have no friends here and I can\u2019t talk to people because I\u2019m so fucking weird talking to people and I can\u2019t ducking change this one thing I said to the friends that I really liked and I knew they really liked me until one ducking shitty fucken thing I can\u2019t do this anymore I really can\u2019t I every moment is dreadful I can\u2019t take it I have no one to vent to so I\u2019m on fkn Reddit looking for someone to tell me it\u2019s all ok the only person I like is a girl I know online who we talk about music and all this stuff we have in common but all the people I know in real life hate me or I cant be around them without throwing up fkn shit.",

Last November ( the day before thanksgiving) I was helping out in the kitchen cause I liked cooking with my mom. I was making pumpkin pie and older sister was down there on her phone. My dad was talking to my mom sitting at the island. My mom handed me a piece of paper and said \u201cDo this recipe instead of the can recipe\u201d, but the only problem was that I already started doing the can recipe. Like I already added the eggs and stuff. I thought that I could still continue to make the pumpkin pie, but with another recipe. So I did and when I was done the batter looked very watery. I showed my mom and she snapped. She just lost it. She didn\u2019t tell yet, but my dad started asking questions or just trying to make conversation and my mom gave him ALL attitude and was very aggressive saying stuff like \u201c can\u2019t you see I\u2019m doing something blah blah blah\u201d you get the point. My dad knowing how my mom is got up and went to the room cause he didn\u2019t want to start something further. My mom begin to criticize my sister for being down stairs and not doing anything, but the thing about my sister is that she really doesn\u2019t spend family time. So her being down stairs was a good enough treat to me anyway. Then when my sister was leaving she started to yell at me about the pie so I just left with my sister. About a hour later my mom literally left the house cause everything has to be about her. She left came back about a hour later. Thanksgiving was trash. She ruined the whole vibe. The only person she talked to was my dad. Maybe like 2 days later we put up the Christmas tree and she was still salty. Still ain\u2019t say anything to me or my sister. My brain blocked out most of the shifty things she done to me last year so I don\u2019t rly remember but at one time she the same year so in December she said she didn\u2019t do anything wrong in the situation and how we ruined the vibe. I tried to take my life around 20+ times last year, but of course no ones knows that. Fast forward to about March of 2021. My mental health is still bad. Me and my mom fought about someone I don\u2019t remember what it was but she kept a attitude with me. When I was doing school work one of the days she yelled like YELLED  I reacted fast so I started getting defensive before she could even say anything. Big mistake. She started yelling at me for getting defensive and than she lunged at me (keep in mind I didn\u2019t touch her) she lunged at me and the only thing protecting me was myself. She said \u201cwhat are you going to do\u201d. I said \u201c defend myself\u201d. She proceeded to say \u201c defend yo self bitch\u201d walking away going to her room. She slammed the door but I could still hear her. She got the gun. I could hear her loading something. Or it was a clicking noise. I knew. We have a M-9. I didn\u2019t know what to do. So I got up and went to my back yard. Where I proceeded to cry and stay out there for 2 hours. I went back inside cause it started to rain. My dad came home and yelled at me cause my mom brain washing him. He started saying I\u2019m not allowed to show emotion cause I\u2019m a child. My mom went up in my room started trying to fight me. Like fist fight. I broke down I just wanted to do my school work and die. Then hours later My mom then went in my room hours later to SAGE IT. She didn\u2019t save her room, but she saged my room. Our relationship hasn\u2019t been the same since.I wish her and my dad got a divorce cause my dad is such a loving and caring person and she\u2019s a whole ASS witch. She treats my dad like trash. Yes they\u2019ve been married for 18 years but that doesn\u2019t mean there happy. As bad as it sounds I kinda wish my mom died. She just sucks, but the next time I\u2019m home alone I\u2019m gonna get the gun and shoot myself. I cannot take it anymore. I can\u2019t be here for another 4 years. I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m already failing my classes and it\u2019s only the 1st month of school. It sucks because my life was actually starting to look up but I know this happiness won\u2019t last forever.

        "selftext": "\"All I want is to have autonomy and choice regarding my own body. All I want is to die with dignity. All I want is to rest in peace. Why is that too much to ask?\"\n\nLet's take religion out of the picture. The existence of religion is subjective. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nFamily - everyone starts there as a reason. I guess it's because people believe everyone has a good relationship with their mothers, and fathers, sisters and brothers. If that's not the case, it can always \"be fixed\". It can always improve. With divorced parents, a self centered mother and a sister that talks to me once a year, I don't see anything changing. I wouldn't feel guilt leaving them because they didn't feel guilt about abandoning me. Extended family have also made it clear that I do not belong - most of them don't acknowledge my existence. The ones that do take the Mickey out of me. \n\nI don't have friends. I don't plan on getting friends. I find it tiring to have to move my lips to talk, much less type or anything similar. Countless, horrible, experiences with people were enough to get the message through. Relying on people to give me strength or happiness is a surefire way to experience disappointment. An inability for them to understand - regardless of what they've been through - and a failure for me to understand them makes the entire thing null. If I had the energy, I probably would hate everybody. \n\nSomeone told me that I should live for the \"beautiful things in life\". Beautiful things that fall short to the sufferings of life. Someone else told me that \"pleasure is derived from suffering. to feel full would mean you had to be hungry. to be warm means you had to be cold. to feel comfort means you would have to feel the bitterness of isolation\". I don't think the small, ephemeral pleasures of life could ever make suffering seem worth it. I don't see how the party life at 21 - friendships, alcohol, sex, recklessness - will ever be worth the next 50 years of hard labour - labour that for the average person will never be rewarded. I don't see how the \"beautiful things in life\" will ever negate the horrible suffering of growing old and gray - watching the people that carry the only memories of you.. in actuality, watching yourself die before you do yourself. I don't know how years of pity from those younger than you, constant misunderstanding, isolation, pain, fatigue, medication, and a plethora of other things will ever justify existing in the first place. Nevermind the suffering and pain I'm in at the moment.\n\nPotential children? The guilt I would feel bringing a beautiful little girl, or a charming boy (or other) into this world would kill me in of itself. I would never be able to live with myself knowing I subject someone - someone who did nothing to me - constant suffering. Constant questioning about the meaning of life, only to find out that their only purpose was to satisfy my needs. Even if that wasn't the case, the meaninglessness of it all, the pain of it all, the overwhelming badness of the world inside and outside their head would never be worth it.\n\nSelf improvement? It's suicide awareness month right now. September. Spreading information about suicidal people, telling them it's not selfish, helping them feel accepted. A lot of suicidal people would love that. To feel accepted. To feel understood. I'd imagine a lot of suicidal people constantly reach out for help - suicide attempts, cutting, telling people and so on. A lot of those people want a better existence. For \"the pain to stop\". A lot of them have an aspiration for something; hope that they can look up to and say \"This is what I want\", regardless of how tall the ladder is to reach it. Suicide prevention, therapy, counseling, drugs, inspirational quotes - all of which would help them, most probably. All of which are tailored to them. What about the people that dread waking up every morning? What about the people that don't have an idea of what they want, because the mere process of thinking is intoxicating? What about the people who dread the existence of heaven because it means they would have to live for an eternity? The people like me who would still off themselves if they had all the fortune in the world, or non at all? Who had love and relationships and family and children, but would still kill themselves because the idea of having to breathe...\n\nI should get ready soon..",

        "selftext": "I started going through therapy again for the nth time and I\u2019ve been in and out of it for 3 years. The reason for stopping is because I feel like none of the methods, which mainly involved medicines, from my past doctors worked for me. They are also either psychiatrist or neuropsychiatrists. All of them immediately told me after one session that it\u2019s major depressive disorder, which I think is a misdiagnosis. Idk, it\u2019s too hasty for me.\n\nThis time, I decided to approach a psychologist to try talk therapy. However, she said that she would also need the help of a psychiatrist since my condition, which is not yet diagnosed, is quite complex. Here lies my negative thought - what if I\u2019m a lost cause? What if I\u2019m never meant to heal?\n\nTherapies can cost a lot of money and I live in the Philippines where there is very little support for mental health. A session can cost 1000-4000 PHP and my current therapist charges me 3000 PHP per session. But since she wants me to see a separate psychiatrist, that would mean another 3000 PHP (this clinic have a resident psych and this is their rate). She wants us to have consistency, so I should see both of them once a week. With that, I would have to spend 24000 PHP a month, medicines excluded. I am also from a middle income family. I\u2019m currently in college and I have two younger siblings, one also in college level and the other in 10th grad. Just imagine how hard our finances are with that. I was able to open this up to my sister and all she was able to ask if I\u2019m sure I want to do this.\n\nWhat do you think? Should I just stop seeking help and accept the fact that I have to deal with this for the rest of my life? Well, I plan on not living beyond 30. Yes, I also suffer from passive suicidal ideation but that\u2019s gonna take a whole other thread to elaborate. I don\u2019t want to become an even heavier burden than what I already feel all my life.",

I hope you can see this post and get something helpful out of it! \n\nHere is my reply:\n\nI did this to my girlfriend in the past as well. She had a similar opinion to yours on this topic, and I had an similar opinion to the one I assume your boyfriend takes. Your boyfriend is doing this because he cares about you and doesn't want you to be hurt, and I know you know that because you even addressed it yourself. It doesn't make his approach to stopping you \"right\" necessarily, but I took that same approach and I understand 100% why he would want to take it too. I always got really really scared, so scared I felt sick, because I cared so much about my girlfriend and didn't want her to get hurt. So I'd always immediately threaten to hurt myself, because I knew it was the one guaranteed way to stop her. He's probably thinking similarly to me on that. Also, I'm glad you don't really feel the need to do that too often! And about feeling the need to hurt something, why not get a punching bag and beat the everliving shit out of it? I bet it would help! It usually helps me to do exercise, break items, punch a punching bag, or even scream. Screaming is ofc something you have to be careful of, not to get a noise complaint but other than that it helped me decently. And having a boyfriend, by the sound of it, living with you would help a lot too. You can find a healthy vent for you and make sure he's aware of it so it won't freak him out at first, then use that vent and he'll be there to care for you afterwards. I definitely think, although it's a really difficult topic, talking about healthy responses to that urge with your boyfriend could be beneficial. I hope my suggestions can be helpful as well. (p.s. try pushups or something if the other stuff won't work). \n\nAlso, I don't blame you, it's super hard to deal with lots of emotions sometimes. So it's normal to feel the need to self harm in rough situations. Of course that doesn't mean it's good to do so, and I definitely think you should try your best to stop entirely, and don't be afraid to lean on your boyfriend for help with that. Or even reddit if you must. \n\nAnd lastly, you're not crazy for any of that. I actually hit my head a lot too. I don't see anything crazy about it. It's just a surge of terrible emotions that leads me to do that. Almost like I suppressed all other movements but that's where the energy was released. \n\nI hope my suggestions for alternatives help. I can list them all again below just to make sure it's not too messy to read (sorry lol. I write bad sometimes, and it's almost 4AM lol)\n\n-Exercise such a pushups, situps, running/jogging... Etc\n-Punching bags, or punching a pillow\n-Breaking items (not the best option. Probably less effective and just, destructive, but if it works go for it!)\n-Screaming, be sure to do it in a way that won't get a noise complaint. Also, there's even a way to do it without making your voice sore. I forget what it's called. Maybe something like \"Viking scream therapy\".\n-Rubber bands, you can flick yourself with a rubber band to maybe satiate that urge in a less impactful way. \n-Meditation (Really not sure if it would work, but if you can calm down and keep your head clear maybe you could suppress the urge. I'd personally try exercise and stuff first bc it seems way more effective but if this works it would work well I'd imagine)\n-Help from your boyfriend. Hopefully he can either help support you, talk to you, cuddle you and so on when you need it. He can also come up with other ideas and talk to you about what helps you!\n\nI hope I've been helpful. If you ever need anything my dms are open but if you don't need to dm that's perfectly fine. And I know it's weird to offer lol. But I'd rather make sure it's known and have a chance of helping when needed than not let it be known and never be contacted. I'd prefer you ask your boyfriend for help first, or post on a subreddit bc your boyfriend could help the best, and a post gains more replies. But if you need someone direct, that is a stranger I'll be here for you. \n\nHave a great day/night. Take care!",

I have borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, generalized anxiety disorder, and cPTSD. I was heavily neglected as a child and shamed for my disabilities. I began withdrawing from others and taking all my anger, sadness and disgust about the world out on myself. Some of you may know how that feels but some may not. \n\nTwo months ago on the 10th of this month will mark two months since my most severe suicide attempt. I will spare you the details but let\u2019s just say I spent awhile in the intensive care unit. The reason I did it was because of the severe abuse I was experiencing at home. I felt there was no way out. \n\nWhen my father was physically and verbally abusing me, it hurt. It hurt that someone who is supposed to love me was doing this. I became so consumed by this hurt that my self worth was and is still badly damaged. \n\nBut, I must say, after all that, I have started to get back my will to fight on. And it feels so good. Often times, at least for myself, I just want the pain to go away in the moment. It\u2019s not just any ordinary pain, it rips apart your soul into a million pieces.

Hope I don't need karma to post this.\n\nI am planning on doing it soon. I will leave in secret, nobody has to know until then. I started selling my stuff, deleting files from my computer, I am getting rid of my existence slowly enough so no one notices a thing. And in the time between my final decision on dying till now, I realised, that I don't actually want to die. I have wonderful parents who give me a home and food and love. I have like only three friends but I know they would be hurt by my death. I wish I could be a normal functioning member of society that doesn't feel the urge to kill themselves. But I am not and sadly I know continuing to live means I will just suffer more and more and more and more until I really can't hold onto anymore. So what is the point in trying to live on if I already know that I am just waiting for it to become even worse than it already is? I was meant to die by my own hands. No that's not right, I was never meant to even being born. My parents should've aborted me. Or even better they should've used protection. It would've spared me and them a lot of unnecessary pain. But they wanted me, they loved me from the moment they saw me on the ultrasound. Sometimes I wish they didn't. Because loving me means they will suffer when I die before them. And I am really sorry. Again I wish I was normal. I wish I deserved to live, but I am not worth anything. I am a horrible human being, rotten from inside out and the world doesn't need such a useless piece of shit like me. Nonetheless I am sorry to my parents and to my friends. I wish I could've been someone that was deserving of their love.",

I mean if you really boil it down, life is just a series of jumping from meaningless distraction to meaningless distraction over and over again, constantly chasing some kinda fucking happiness dragon, just to pass the time, to tick down the fucking clock until, maybe, one day, if you\u2019re lucky, you die in your sleep. And then you\u2019re just dead and that\u2019s it. Nothing you ever did matters to you anymore. Depending on how you lived your life, *maybe* the stuff you did matters to a couple more people for a little longer until they either forgot or die and then it\u2019s just all gone, like it never existed at all for the mass majority of people. And if you do leave behind some kinda long-lasting legacy like Einstein or Martin Luther King or someone, what the fuck do you care now? You don\u2019t even know it. You\u2019re dead.\n\nAnd I get that some people enjoy the journey or whatever but I don\u2019t. I simply don\u2019t fucking care about anything. Out of everything I\u2019ve experienced in life so far, I can honestly say I wouldn\u2019t give a shit if I never experienced any of it again, which isn\u2019t even to say it\u2019s all been horrible, I\u2019ve just never had an actually impactful positive experience. It\u2019s all just been fleeting at best. And I\u2019ve had plenty of impactful negative experiences and I dunno, it just kinda seems like the equation just doesn\u2019t balance. Life sucks more than it\u2019s good and I really don\u2019t see any incentive at all to wanna prolong it any longer. \n\nAnd then you factor in that we love in a society that purposefully spaces out the good things, especially if you\u2019re fucking broke all the time cause your mental issues prevent you from holding down jobs for more than about 3 months like me. So much of the shit you\u2019re trying to work towards is just locked behind a fucking paywall that feels basically insurmountable to me at this point. Case and point, thought it might be an ok distraction to try and replace my furniture with shit I built myself, but then I looked at how much even the most basic tools I\u2019d need to do it cost, plus the cost of materials and realised that it\u2019s basically gonna take me a fucking year just to put aside the money required to do even some basic fucking distraction like that. It just feels like when shitty game developers pad out the length of a game by cramming hours and hours of tedious grinding in between every main quest. It just feels fucking cheap and it doesn\u2019t need to be like this, yet there\u2019s nothing you can fucking do about it either.\n\nI dunno, every time I think about life, I feel like I come to the same conclusion. That I\u2019m just waiting out the fucking clock by doing meaningless things that don\u2019t even fulfil me in any way and if I really think about it, I\u2019d kinda just like to skip straight to the end cause I\u2019m just over it.",

        "selftext": "         I don't feel anything anymore, just sadness, self pity, and self hatred for myself. Sometimes I just come home and cry until there's no tears left to cry. I can't force the smile anymore. I just can't fucking live with the fact that I'll be alone forever anymore.\n\n        I'm a junior in high school, 15 turning 16 in a week or so. Over the past couple of months, I think I've truly discovered just how much of a bag of shit I am. I make mistakes on the simplest shit possible at work and have no motivation to do anything at school anymore. At work, I can't do anything without a RedBull in my system, and at school I have to take a godforsaken pill every morning that for my stupid fucking ADHD ass mind just so I can focus and have a chance at passing my classes instead of failing them like last year, and it doesn't help that the pill makes me more depressed and antisocial than I already am. My friends of 13 years - those that I've always considered my brothers - are starting more and more to avoid me and not include me in shit, cause I apparently make them look bad in front of everyone at school. They walk past me in the halls, pretending I simply don't exist. Don't even bat an eye. Every relationship I've been in, I've tried to be the best partner I can and show as much love as I can to them, as I rarely receive any at all. And what happens? They dump me like a bag of garbage at a landfill. My first girlfriend (lasted a year and a half, loved the shit outta her) dumped while I was crying my eyes out when I found out she cheated. The one after (8 months) basically just forgot we dated sometimes during the relationship since she'd just ghost me for so long. The next cheated on me, and told me every detail about it, which really fucked me up. The one after, I truly thought that she was THE one, she checked every box, had amazing personality, she was beautiful, and just loved to chill and cuddle. Then while we were talking, the topic eventually got to porn, I told her I watch it, (I think im addicted, I fucking hate it) then she was pissed with me the rest of the date, wouldn't tell me what was wrong. Once I got home, I got a message that she was suddenly not ready to be in a relationship, but she still liked me and she'd come back when she was ready. I've been on delivered from her for 2 months, and she came out as bi after. I truly believe I'm gonna be alone for my whole life. My only goal in life that I wish to achieve is just to raise a good family. To be a good father and husband to my future wife and children. To show them unconditional love and be truly happy. But that'll never happen if I can't find a woman who'll actually give a shit and love me back. What's the point of living if you'll never be able to achieve any of your goals in life, not even ONE? What reason do I have in existing if I'll never amount to anything and never truly find happiness? I just can't do this shit anymore. I don't wanna exist on this lonely unforgiving world anymore.",

Throughout my life there have been certain phases where I'd either worked on myself a ton, went to way too many parties, and ones where I just isolate myself because I'm scared of life. Through all the struggle, women still disregard my existence while they obsess over my friends. I view myself as the one who's always left out, but no one says it to my face. I've been told I look good somedays and also been told the opposite. I've had years where I've worked hard with socializing and ones where I haven't. Oh, and also I've seen many therapists about my depression and stuff of that matter.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm still alone and no matter how much I've opened myself up I'll never be loved. I'm just not good enough. I feel like its important if I realize that now so I'm not disappointed in the future. My parents love me and are still around which keeps me going often. My plan is too wait till they pass when I'm older and finally fulfill my destiny of ending it all, because its clear that I'm just not good enough while everyone around me is. \n\nI'm wondering what I should do now while I'm still around?",

My head started aching. This stress and anxiety is terrible. Im already depressed and semi-sucidal and this is not helping. \n\nRight now, I only see two paths and either way Im miserable and left not wanting to live. One with him around and I get the anxiety and get sick or one with him not and me being absolutely lost. I dont want a future without him at all. If he's not in it, then it's not worth it. \n\nThe only other option he wont do and I know for a fact Im not important enough for him to even consider it. Im just the piece of shit no one cares about. I was never important enough to him or anyone else. No matter how much effort I put in, it wasnt enough. All the times I tried to comfort him and support him just count for nothing. He wont even try to do the same for me\n\nHe may be my best friend, and he may say Im his, but not once has he ever shown me the care or comfort of a best friend. I dont understand why I love him and care about him so much when he wont even do simple things for me. I love and care for someone who supposedly loves and cares for me back, but it really just seems like he hates me most of the time and that Im a nuisance\n\nI know Im not the easiest friend or girlfriend, but I always tried my absolute hardest to make him happy. Tried my hardest to comfort him, to support him, whenever, no matter what, even if Im upset and feeling like absolute shit myself. I always tried my best. I loved him so much and would have spent my life with him, but it just feels like Im the dirt underneath his shoes most of the time\n\nThis breaks me further everytime we spoke because I honestly love him more than anything else and I just know that I barely mean a thing to him. I wanted to mean a lot to him and be important to him. But in reality, Im just a waste of time for him, just a waste of energy and useless. I know Im worthless to him. At this point I dont even think I should be alive anymore, Im just a waste of resources. I really thought I could mean something to him, that I did mean something to him\n\nI hate myself, I hate my body, I hate my mind. I hate everything about me. I can see why I was worthless to him. I can see why he wouldnt ever do it. I can see why I'll always be that piece of dirt. Worthless and useless. I can't even function like a normal person anymore.\n\n It doesnt make sense for me to keep living at this point. I just want to end everything and rest in peace. Thats all I want.

Didn\u2019t last long cause now it pumps me full of so much guilt I don\u2019t even have the option of getting numb anymore. So I\u2019ve stopped for good, I guess. And people pat you on the fucking back over it, acting like it matters at all. Acting like you\u2019re out the other side of hell, even though you\u2019re stuck in the worst hell you\u2019ve ever been in cause now you have zero solutions just like before, but less options. Tell you \u201cyou should be proud\u201d like you can even feel proud. Like them saying they\u2019re proud or that you should be means anything to me, like it fucking translates at all.\n\nUsed to at least want things. Now I don\u2019t even fucking care. Used to want to have someone to end the crippling fucking loneliness. Knew I couldn\u2019t get it because I can\u2019t connect with people, don\u2019t even know why, just can\u2019t. Knew people always just made me feel *more* alone. But I still wanted *someone*, even if it was a pipe dream. But now I don\u2019t fucking care. Sounds like effort, energy I just don\u2019t have. Couldn\u2019t have friends or a girlfriend anyway. Too unstable. Who wants to be around someone who can go from being fine the last time you spoke to them to being completely fucked and suicidal the next? And even when I\u2019m \u201cfine\u201d now, it just an act, a fucking facade that eventually I won\u2019t have the energy to keep up. Been years since I was anything but horrifically, suicidally depressed. Probably good I can\u2019t connect to people.\n\nAnyway don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m bothering to type this. No therapist or medication can help, no one here\u2019s gonna be able to. Guess it\u2019s just to vent. To just announce I\u2019ve given up. Tried to get my meds today, got told they\u2019re \u201cnot covered\u201d by my pension card. Would\u2019ve cost me $40 for 28 days worth. Can\u2019t afford it. Just fucking broke. One of the side effects of my diseased brain, can\u2019t hold down a fucking job. Working for more than about 6 months either makes me so depressed I start self-harming, drinking or having suicide attempts, makes me catatonically dissociative so I barely know where I am and can\u2019t hear people talking to me or it just puts me into a full-blown psychosis. Either way, the result is the same, either get fired or have to quit. So my bank accounts are empty from all the failed treatments and worthless medications. So I\u2019m just stopping, don\u2019t really have a choice. Just not renewing my scripts. Coming off the meds, don\u2019t give a shit if I\u2019m on the highest dose for both. Don\u2019t have a choice. I just fucking give up.",

And had no irl friends so I felt extremely alone in my pain. No one to relate to or talk to. My parents apparently cared but not enough to make me feel like my feelings were valid.\n\nAnyways, now that I can be on social media way more, I can see all these people talking about how depressed they are and it's almost like I'm jealous because I dont feel it anymore. Like, now it's too late. Yeah the way the world works still makes me feel like shit but it's just not the same? I dont know... it's stupid. \n\nAnd I KNOW depression is not cool or fun, of course I'm aware, but somehow I still want it back. It gave me a reason to be lazy, to not gaf about my life.\n\nI feel like my depression was never valid in the first place anyway. People have it so much worse than me, like so much fucking worse 14yo me couldn't even imagine, and here I was acting like a spoiled kid.\n\nI hate myself. I suppose THAT will never go away. I feel like I'm always seeking attention even when I try hard not to.\n\ni'm so weird. I hate everything I do. The way I act seems so fucked up. Why am I like this.\n\n I've seen a few therapists but I can never bring myself to talk about the entire situation I'm in. I'm just so ashamed of my own person and sometimes I dont even know why.\n\nEverything is just a big confusion, \"adolescence\" they'll say. Yeah, well I'm considered an adult now, so I guess not. But even before hitting the teenage years, I always felt ashamed of myself in a way. So I don't think that's entirely related.\n\nI wish I could just go back in time and rewatch every single thing that happened for me to turn out this way.

IDK if this is the right place to post either)**\n\nI'll try to explain the best I can, but I am honestly confused by my own mind. I don't understand why I am like this, or if it's just my mental illness playing tricks on me. \n\nFor as long as I can remember, maybe aged 8 or so, I have rejected a lot of things that girls are supposed to like or be like. I am now almost 22 and it's just getting worse.\n\nIt started off with small things like hating cats, dresses, the colour pink and claiming to be a tomboy. I would even got irritated when others were more tomboyish than me, like I had to prove something. \n\nAt the same time I always loved Bratz and Barbies, but I also loved boys toys, and was never allowed to get them. As I've gotten older, things have escalated... \n\nI refuse to wear woman's clothing. I feel uncomfortable in anything remotely feminine, floral or cut, doesn't matter, I will not wear it. I do enjoy feminine clothes, just not on myself.  I don't wear make up, jewellery, or anything of the sort. \n\nMy own mother continuously calls me a lesbian. I am not. She never allowed me to buy boys clothes until I got old enough to buy my own, now she just calls me gay, and says no man will ever want me. \n\nI refuse the idea of becoming pregnant and having to take birth control. I feel disgusted in my own period, not that blood disgust me, just the idea that I have a reproductive system inside of me. I refuse to have any invasive test such as pap smears. I'm a virgin, for these reasons. I do want to have sex one day but I can't even begin to imagine be forced to take birth control, or becoming pregnant. \n\nI feel powerless as a female. I know women are strong, but I feel as if I am not. I daydream about being a male, even though I'm fine being a female for the most part, I don't care to change my gender, but I feel as if I would 100% pick being a male. \n\nI hate the fact women are seen as old and useless by 30. I hate that I'm being pressured into getting married and having children. The idea of pregnancy petrifies me to no end, but society tells females if they don't have children, they're useless. I personally don't believe this, yet here I am, worrying about it. I do want children one day, but not by me giving birth. \n\nIt's so weird to me. I love the colour pink now. I love Bratz and Barbies. I hate dressing feminine and make up. I hate my own reproductive organs. \n\nI feel a tremendous amount of pressure on me, like a unbelievable amount. The future scares me. The fact I am a virgin scares me. I feel like if I wait to long, it will be a red flag. Maybe I already am one. I just want to live in a fantasy world, but earth isn't one of them. \n\nI hope I haven't offended anyone... this is just how I feel. I need advice.",

Until one day I said it and we didn't talk for weeks. Turns out she was having sex parties and doing drugs. She got into legal trouble and was very depressed. I got back together with her and we dated for about 2 more months until she had sex with a guy in a coffee shop. I was destroyed because she promised she would always be loyal. I never felt what I felt that night. I was shaking like I was freezing and my teeth clattering. I forgave her but our relationship couldn't work after a week because I was in too much pain because of her. We continued to be friends. I helped her out with all of her troubles and we watched shows together. Until I found out she was in a serious relationship with the guy she originally cheated on me with. She was fucking him. I was just starting to recover from everything but this got me. I can't take the pain. I feel like i'm sick. I'm alone and I have no friends. I just blocked her on all my social media platforms. I love her and I cant move on. I only see on escape.",

It's like she passed her obligations to me when I haven't even learned a single thing from her. she even gets half of my (really really small) allowance I get from someone. i just can't take the fact that she's able to buy stuff for her new baby but cant even buy us (more) decent food. i'm so tired of ceying over the same shit again and again. it's just too heavy and i dont know what to do. i want to provide my little brothers good stuff but i don't even know where to start. i was thinking of doing art commisions but i dont even have materials :( everything is so heavy right now. i just feel like giving up sometimes. what do i do? :( how do me nd my little brothers get by :(",

I first off apologize if this is all over the place. I think telling people your problems is cringy and stupid yet here I am knowing I'm gonna get the \"stay strong\", \"you're still young\" or \"you're not alone\" shit because I heard it from people around me. Let's start with my story I suppose I have nothing to hide especially from people on the internet even if only one person sees this but I want to type it out because i just want to know that someone somewhere knows what I'm going through regardless if it feels like nothing and absolutely silly to me, childish even. There's so much that I can't talk about because I don't have the patience to write this out because I'll overthink it, my mom was a violent alcoholic and my dad was never home because he was always working to keep a roof over our head so being 4 years old with a lady screaming at you isn't so fun, then I contracted pseudomonas in my ear around the same age losing 85% of hearing in my left ear and 15% in my right and ended up spending 8 months in the hospital, went back home same shit abusive dad and alcoholic mom, hated going to school but still went until high-school grade 7 here in Canada, I skipped a lot of school, doing this from 7-10 and ending failing grade 10 to where I'm at now adult education attended two solid weeks then started skipping again but let's get back to when I got out of the hospital maybe a year later youth protection got involved for a variety of reason regarding my parents and going to school smelling like cat piss because our family was so poor. Skip forward couple a years my dad finally left my mom and I choose to go with him but my 3 brothers stayed, 2 with autism. Mind you I am the youngest. 9 years of age at that point, at 11 I got involved with my cousins smoking weed, drinking alcohol, stealing etc... long story short I got molested, yep. only people that know that are my former gf and you guys so that's nice ig, continue to move forward rest of elementary was a breeze regardless of still being dirt poor getting beat or whatever else happend, so grade 7. August my nephew died at 10 days old, half sister had to have a c section but the doctors accidentally cut the placenta and the baby ended up swallowing some of the contents and died attended the funeral, cried, oh well that's life.\nGrade 9 grandfather died while my dad was in the hospital almost dead with esophagus cancer. My dad was in the same hospital with him and and I would visit my dad everyday but I wouldn't visit my grandfather because him and me got into a fight over the fact that I was doing stupid shit that I don't wish to go into depth with. So I stopped visiting him 3 months prior to him being in the hospital, then when he was in the hospital I didn't visit him either because I didn't think he was gonna die, we were really fucking close. Grade 10 made a suicide joke that wasn't a joke but I played it off as a joke to my social worker, very stupid in hindsight. I got placed in a group home for the 4th time like I said I'm leaving a bunch of stuff out so ye. but I played it off as a joke and they let me out and now my grandmother is in the hospital. She's practically dead that's what the doctors said but oh well, I feel like I've seen it all, been through it all and so this is the highlights, that's not including my anxiety, my constant stress of school, cutting people out of my life , left and right so I'm all alone and many many many other things that I did not include but ye a note of my not so terrible life.

        "selftext": "Okay\u2026\n\nRight now, I am going through an episode of significant depression and a touch of apathy that is manifesting in household irresponsibility - largely with housework and my fianc\u00e9 reached her snapping point with it. She\u2019s distanced herself from me - detaching herself and mostly keeping separate from me - I work night shifts, so I don\u2019t see much of her anyway and she\u2019s a night owl, so she\u2019s had me sleeping on the couch in the living room the past few days. She describes it as \u201csetting boundaries\u201d and has been transparent about her anger with my lack of consistency with chores.\n\nI need to work on having empathy in her regard, apparently my lack of attentiveness to house chores is ignited PTSD-related memories about her dad in her childhood. The most fundamental element to her reasoning is that my depression has gotten catastrophic - with which I can agree - I might be an asshole for this, but I feel her anger has gotten the better of her as she claims I prioritize \u201cwork over family/household\u201d because of neglecting house chores. The reason I find this a bit extreme is because I DO do things to help contribute to the house - I make dinner, I drive her places when she doesn\u2019t feel up to driving, I have to fight my social anxiety to do most of the shopping for the house, and then I always try to be emotionally supportive by listening without judgement - it almost feels thankless.\n\nThe peak of the dilemma came to be when my fianc\u00e9 told me that she has contemplated self-harm in a manner evocative to her dad\u2019s mistreatment of her; I was desperate to get her out of her emotionally abusive household so she could feel safe - lack of safety is never something I want to feel in a relationship - but this very danger appears to have followed her in the form of me. I recognize that I acted selfishly and with apathy by letting my depression and lack of executive functioning (as a neurodivergent person) get the better of me, but I feel conflicted as I never would make any deliberate attempts to emotionally harm my fianc\u00e9 herself as I care for her. I feel as if she expects me to grow up from my childishness within a short time (which is more of a misinterpretation on my part most likely) and simply overcome my neuroticism, but I might have to make an ultimate decision if I still pose a danger to her.\n\nThank you.",

I\u2019m also horribly fragile emotionally - my fianc\u00e9 wants me to try and get in touch with her dad, but his temper issues and generally abrasive mannerism makes me feel claustrophobic and scared.\n\nFor context, I know for certain that I am neurodivergent - it\u2019s just a frustratingly ambiguous gray area about whether its autism, ADHD, both, or none - mostly because of a cruddy medical history. I don\u2019t know, there is something within my mind that makes it to where I can never really be a fully dependent, autonomous person. Whenever there is something that threatens my emotional insecurity (scares me, simply) then my option is to run away or freak out if I can\u2019t and I feel I don\u2019t have the mental capacity to maintain adult responsibilities.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 proclaims she is \u201cputting up boundaries\u201d, but for the past couple days, it\u2019s sort of felt like that she has shut me out because of exhausted anger of having to \u201craise\u201d me.

Due to circumstances beyond my control I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of added stress and I think my body is finally breaking down on me. A lot of work related stuff but at least I can escape work, now life is just going downhill and filled with existential dread.\n\nMy father in law is dying and it\u2019s really hard on everybody, including me. Apparently he was in the 5% of people that would most likely die from the new covid variant. We\u2019re pretty sure my boyfriend and his stepmom caught it at the beginning of the pandemic so it\u2019s shocking to see how much it\u2019s killing him now.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t want sympathy or to talk about it that much even though I\u2019m really messed up over it and I know he has to be feeling way worse than me and just doesn\u2019t want to show it. And to make things worse we think his stepmom started doing hard drugs again, and one of my father in law\u2019s best friends just died suddenly yesterday because he touched a live power line at his job.\n\nMy bf has 3 little brothers and I\u2019m scared for everyone right now. Idk what\u2019s going to happen and its really making me question my life\u2019s purpose. I feel empty and terrible and I think all this stress and feeling suicidal over feeling like I have no purpose is taking a toll on me physically. \n\nI\u2019ve been eating and sleeping as normal but occasionally I\u2019ll experience vertigo out of nowhere. I\u2019ve also been having migraines so bad that I won\u2019t be able to look outside and sometimes my vision will get all spotty. \n\nI almost blacked out at work the other night just by picking my head up too fast which was kinda my first red flag that something wasn\u2019t right. \n\nI\u2019ll occasionally get confused or distracted and forget what I was doing. For example when I was making dinner the other night I started pouring scallops into a strainer that I wasn\u2019t holding over anything and kept pouring for a few seconds before realizing I was getting fish water all over my floor.\n\nI think I\u2019ve just been so upset lately that it\u2019s making me sick. For those wondering I\u2019m 90% sure it\u2019s not covid related, I can still smell, taste, and breathe fine. And I don\u2019t feel that weak until I get the vertigo which isn\u2019t all the time.

I was sexually abused by my mom growing up but it\u2019s not the kind of thing you can mention to your extended family or most friends. It still affects me to this day with diagnosed PTSD and also physically\u2026 being sodomized can lead to long term fissures in your body that can be reopened really easily even as an adult. I was in a bad work situation, divorced, and fissure issues the last year. My health issues got so bad I almost passed away a few months ago (got bacterial infection from fissure). \n\nLast year I also got an amazing team of mental health care workers I let into my life after having really bad luck previously. They really gave me the strength and objective perspective to change my life away. I still get triggered sometimes and feel alone after cutting things off with most of my family (without them knowing why), but I am really grateful for this human beings that have helped me realize my past wasn\u2019t inherently bad or good, but just gave me a unique perspective. It comes with its own challenges. Turns out some people in my extended family are still accepting even without knowing why I cut off contact which is really nice. \n\n Some reason the last year it was really do or die\u2026 I was on the verge of suicide every day. I had never felt so disconnected and miserable. I guess through this desperation or really having nothing left to lose made me try extreme things. I got some extreme medical treatments that helped, but I was also more open to trusting other human beings about my situation which didn\u2019t seem remotely possible before, I was so ashamed and blamed myself. I thought I was evil (my mom told me I was evil). It was really messed up. But I guess what I wanted to write is there are beautiful beautiful people out there that are willing to help people with such crazy lives. These people  often come from such expected beautiful places I\u2019ve found. Sure there\u2019s people that want to take advantage of openness, to use your pain against you and for their own gain, but these people who listen and share your pain are so much more important and inspiring to think about.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m rambling, but thank you to the people who listen and help non judgmentally.",

Confidence - lowest I've ever been. Put on weight, trying to better my eating and fitness habits but keep slipping often.\n5. Small things - daily allergies, feeling bloated, running my knee into my bedframe on accident\n6. Character - I've become more straightforward, careless, ruthless, quiet. Started looking at the bigger picture and seeing no way out\n7. Time - I'm 23. My day goes to work, my partner, my family, eating, then boom, to sleep. Rinse and repeat.\n8.

        "selftext": "Graduated in April, depression started kicking in around July. \n\nI technically wasn\u2019t supposed to graduate until December of this year, but I dropped one of double minors to graduate \u201con time\u201d out of pressure from my family and financial reasons. Honestly, I didn\u2019t mind it because at the time I was going through so much and the uncertainty of the virus\u2026i just really wanted to go. \n\nNow, I\u2019m working full time at a very toxic and demanding workplace. All while trying to study for the LSAT, which has made this very difficult. I also stay with my parents\u2026and this I wouldn\u2019t mind if my family wasn\u2019t toxic themselves. I was under the impression that being away for 4 years would give them time to fix their issues but I guess not. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly like I can\u2019t find any peace. Work is demanding, can\u2019t go home and decompress from it because of family, and all of my friends are still in school themselves\u2026so trying to maintain those relationships have been a struggle as well. \n\nI go back in forth between wanting my undergrad life back so much. I can\u2019t cope with the idea that I had two choices: stay in school a little longer and make sure you are secure or go ahead and graduate and take the first job you are offered.  \n\nPlease tell me it gets better\u2026haven\u2019t felt this sad in so long.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a 32M who has struggled with depression literally since I was a preteen. There are a multitude of factors that has caused this. From genetics, to family dynamics, early childhood trauma. It\u2019s also precipitated a lot of other challenges i.e. substance abuse and dependency on alcohol, lost friendships and a failed marriage that ended in divorce, being forced to quit jobs or be fired due to attendance. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to address it on multiple fronts: Been on antidepressants since I was 13, numerous different drugs tried, been seeing a therapist for almost 5 years, ketamine treatments, currently finishing TMS therapy. Nothing has really moved the needle all that much. \n\nDuring my split with my ex, I had to move back into my old room in my dad\u2019s basement. While I\u2019m thankful for the opportunity, I sit here and feel like a giant failure. This last week was awful. I only went to work 1 day. I\u2019ve been sleeping nearly 12 hours everyday. My body feels like it\u2019s completely given up. My mind is following suit. Suicidal ideation is an escape game I play with myself to ease the suffocating sense of disgust I feel with myself. I\u2019ve done it since I was in elementary school. \n\nIt feels like there are no answers. I\u2019m trapped. I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m so tired. I don\u2019t know when it will change. I don\u2019t know if it can. My friends and family all mean well, but there isn\u2019t anything they can do to help. I\u2019m beginning to think there isn\u2019t anything anyone can do to help. I feel like a failure without a chance for any other outcome. Not as long as I feel this much pain and weight. \n\nMost people don\u2019t know how bad it is, because I put on a front to protect them. I don\u2019t want them to worry about me. My dad has no idea I\u2019ve missed that much work this week. I don\u2019t want him to worry. I\u2019ve tried to open up to him in the past, and he couldn\u2019t handle it. It\u2019s also second nature for me to hide myself around others. I\u2019m too ashamed for them to see how I really am. \n\nDecades of struggling takes its toll. Each relapse feels worse than the last. This one especially.",
