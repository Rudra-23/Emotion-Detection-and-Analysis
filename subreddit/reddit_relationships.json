We were together for 4 years. He\u2019s always had a lying problem but now it\u2019s come to a point where I can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nWhen we first met he told me he didn\u2019t smoke weed... Turns out he did, which I wouldn\u2019t mind, but I do not want to be lied to. I\u2019ve told him time and time again, just tell me if you\u2019ve been smoking weed- I don\u2019t mind as long as you don\u2019t do it at work/ when you\u2019re using your car and don\u2019t spend loads of money on it because, this is my second point, you never have any money.\n\nWe\u2019ve lived together for 2 years and I think he\u2019s paid the rent about 6 times. He never has money, never has anything, but apparently works everyday. I do most of the stuff around the house too.\n\nI\u2019ve recently had ileostomy surgery and he was there for me throughout this. And I now obviously feel less attractive than I was and wonder if I should just stay with him because I literally can\u2019t do any better? It\u2019s a horrible thing to say but I don\u2019t know how else to put it. And he was very supportive though out the whole ordeal, but I can\u2019t trust him not to lie to my face.\n\nThe constant lies have just broken my trust completely and I don\u2019t know how I could get over it? I\u2019ve come home to him smoking weed in the lounge, I\u2019ve walked in on him doing bongs, and many more different times now. All these times have ended with me telling him he needs to get help if he\u2019s addicted to which he says \u2018it\u2019s not addictive!!!\u2019 So I say \u2018fine, just let me know, don\u2019t sneak around behind my back and lie to me\u2019- he agrees and it happens again and again. \n\nThen today, I seen him messing in the garden and ask what he was doing- \u2018nothing?!\u2019, I even tell him I feel he\u2019s lying and he laughs and says \u2018no I\u2019m not?\u2019 I then even give him a chance to explain himself, even if he\u2019s lying, just tell me now- nope. Still denying anything. I go out to find a bong hidden in the garden.\n\nI know people are going to say \u2018it\u2019s just weed\u2019 but it\u2019s NOT the weed. It\u2019s the lying and the pure sneakiness? I cannot trust this man. But I just keep thinking \u2018who else is going to get with me?\u2019 We were wanting children soon... I was getting as healthy as I could and going to come off the pill in the next few months?? I\u2019m 30, I have a good job and I was probably a 5/10 before the surgery, now a 2.

We've discussed these reasons already and I think she knows that I'm planning to end things, because she's mentioned a couple of times that if we were to break up she would definitely still want to stay friends and be in each other's lives. I know she means it because she's stayed close friends with all of her exes and it genuinely seems to have worked out fine for her. I on the other hand am not friends with any of my exes; most of them I'm fully no-contact with.

It\u2019s a job that I have been after for an entire year. I have been emailing my current supervisor and boss (m49) (let\u2019s call him Ben) since March 2020 and until I got the job in January. He was always very polite and seemed very professional. Since starting the job, we got acquainted with each other and work well together. My company is only made up of 15 employees, most of which are women. Ben has been in his current position for around 10 years or more. Due to Covid no one is allowed to work at the office location except for himself and I; the reason being is that I\u2019m fully vaccinated. Our department is small and so it consists of just me and him which is why we work together. We only go into the office once a week and the rest is work from home. Over the course of the past few weeks I started to consider him a great coworker and a good work friend. I am by nature a very talkative person and don\u2019t mind sharing about my life. During our breaks, we talk about food, travel and family. He is almost 50 and I am only 23. He has three very young kids that he very much adores and is married. I am getting married this summer and I am very much in love with my fianc\u00e9. I talk a lot about him and our future plans and all of that. Ben started sharing with me about some of his family problems with his wife. I usually stay silent or just nod when he brings up awkward topics. I didn\u2019t think much of it even though my mom and fianc\u00e9 warned me that he might be getting the wrong idea because I\u2019m a good listener. \n\n\nLast week we were sitting in our respective office space and he said there\u2019s a work thing we needed to talk about. I said okay and waited in my office for him to finish his tasks on hand. He yelled to me that he was done and so I asked where he wanted to have the meeting (my office, white board room or conf room, etc...) he then barged into my office and sat down on a chair and said \u201cI don\u2019t know but I don\u2019t want to stay in the office\u201d so then I asked what he meant. He then said \u201cthere\u2019s a cafe right across from our office building where we can have our meeting\u201d and continued with \u201cit\u2019s a beautiful rooftop with a view of the entire city and the river\u201d at this point I stayed quiet and didn\u2019t say anything but I did scrunch up my face at him weirdly because it was 3:30pm and because he had already had his lunch break and I was eating mine across from him. I then said \u201cas you can see I am already eating my lunch\u201d and he then suggestively continued with \u201cthey serve beer and wine\u201d and that\u2019s when I said that\u2019s it\u2019s not a good idea. He then said looked at me and said \u201care you going to report me to Kelly (our executive supervisor)?\u201d I didn\u2019t comment on that and continued with saying that \u201cI have dinner plans with my fianc\u00e9\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t have time\u201d so he answered with \u201cI have three kids to get to at home\u201d he then got extremely flustered and started rambling on about different work projects without making sense. He then got up and said he might go to the cafe alone even though he did mention earlier during the day that he had to be home by 6:00pm cause his wife had asked him to be home for dinner. He then took a book then left and at that point I had texted my sister and fianc\u00e9 and started recording the conversation.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 only works 15 minutes away and so he was downstairs waiting for me. At this point it was already 4:22pm. I was freaking out and so I took my things and left to see my fianc\u00e9. I got in his car and had a breakdown because I am anxious and I was freaking out. He calmed me down and told me to relax. He then drove around the building and we ended up right across from the cafe Ben had mentioned earlier. My finance then told me that we\u2019re going to wait until it\u2019s 5:05pm and walk-in together and if he\u2019s there then we go say hi and sit with him. We walked into this EXTREMELY nice rooftop restaurant/bar and went and sat next to his table. I said hi enthusiastically and pretended that I wasn\u2019t just crying. My fianc\u00e9 was very smooth, he shook his hand and said hi and introduced himself. We sat down and ordered drinks and my fianc\u00e9 made small talk with him from across the table and thanked him for a great restaurant recommendation. Ben was very red and was pretending like it was all good. He then briefly mentioned that I acted weird when he asked me to go get drinks with him during the middle of a workday (it was a Friday btw) and when he told me he needed to be home by a certain time. My fianc\u00e9 answered back that I am professional and like to keep things in my life that way, my boss nodded in agreement. He had already finished his beer and then got up to leave but sat on our table for 5 minutes exactly. My fianc\u00e9 kept giving him these backhanded compliments but Ben was too embarrassed to care. He then said bye and left for dinner.\n\nThis was last week and he is being very weird and cold. I have spoken to him about how I was harassed in an older job due to the nature of it before. I work with a lot of men (I am usually the only female around). He seemed very understanding at the time. I don\u2019t know what this was. Is it normal to ask your much younger assistant to have drinks in the middle of a work day? Am I overreacting? I\u2019d like to highlight that I\u2019ve never had a real job before since I\u2019m fresh out of college and so I don\u2019t understand office dynamics.

We were together for 6 months but also had a previous relationship of 6 months with a 3 month break inbetween. We have always been long distance and he was my bestfriend before we started dating the first time. \n\nBack in August I started college and he went to basic training and our lives completely changed. We wrote letters but none of his never made it to me except for one. After he got out we were so excited and happy but problems started to form, ones like we've never had before. The first one was me and his bestfriend got into a huge fight because he confessed that he had something to do with out previous breakup becaue he didnt like me (me and him are also exs but we didnt end on a bad note we just lost feelings). I talked to my ex about it but it really stressed him out because as he said the two most important people in his life were arguing and he hated it. We eventually resolved it to the point me and his bestfriend could tolerate each other.\n\nAs more time passed and both of our lives gradually grew more and more stressful we argued a lot more. Many of the problems we had werent even us being mad at each other it was the fear of everything else changing. He started losing a lot of people from his life not because of anything specific but just the changes of moving away and joining the military. He started to fear he would lose me to and I felt things changing too beginning to fear it myself. We started acting on our fear and couldnt figure out how to communicate any of this. There was a specific incident where I was under the influence (its legal for me with the percaustions I followed in my area) and we were texting but I forgot half of a sentence that I thought I typed but didnt leaving a sentence that easily became the worst thing I ever said to anyone (because it hurt the person I loved the most). It broke him and I didnt realize I had even said it until he pointed it out. It killed me that I had hurt him and it became my biggest regret. This was the last night he said \"I love you\" to me. This event took place in November. When I asked if he loved me he said he did but he never said it.. \n\nEventually the fights started to die down but through all of the arguing somewhere along the way he still loved me but fell out of love with me. I fought really hard to find anything I could do to save this but with everything else going on in his life he gave up. He was really lost, and still is, emotionally and we broke up when I realized he wasnt in the relationship anymore and had lost his will to fight for us. \n\nHe begged to stay friends because I didnt want to from the previous break up. I eventually gave in because it would hurt him to much to lose another person. We had a talk after the break up where we both were regretting not trying harder not doing things differently. It was a major loss. \n\nWe stayed friends and it was really hard and he tried to keep his distance a bit. I had a week long rebound but everyone knew it was a rebound I just didnt want to accept it. 3 weeks after me and my ex broke up he got onto a new relationship but they broke up after about 3-4 weeks because they couldnt find the time for each other. A week after they started dating I went into no contact (I had no knowledge of his new relationship at this time and found out at week 2 of his new relationship) because I needed time to heal. He wasnt aware I was doing it because if I told him I knew I wouldn't stick to no contact and want to update him at every progress point. We had been distant at this point so I didnt see the harm it would dom I did no contact for 3 weeks but he had reached out to my friend multiple times and to me twice (once was a message and another was a tiktok) trying to get me to talk to him. He asked a friend to set up a group call with her me and him and other things like that when this isnt something he would EVER do. If someone didnt talk to him, he wouldnt push this much. He was extremely hurt that I wasnt talking to him. \n\nAfter 3 weeks of no contact I gave in because he really needed a friend. He was really hurt but tried to play it off as if he knew I would talk to him again, when he told other people the oppisite. We started to get close but during this time I was always trying to figure out how to get him back but I rarely acted on anything unless I was under the influence or a friend did something. One of my now exfriends (who likes me) made a plan and created a whole skit to text my ex to see how he would react knowing I was under the influence and would agree. He ended up texting my ex telling him I sent him to come lie to him and make a whole skit and be an asshole and stuff and some other things, I got the screenshots from my \"friend\" after the guilt took him over weeks later. My ex wasnt mad and didnt seem irritated im the scrrenshots. He actually said he wanted nothing but the best things for me and that I deserved the world. After I found out I texted my ex and apologized and sent screenshots between me and my ex friend explaining the situation. He wasnt mad at me at all and was really kind to me about it. \n\nWe have been really close again recently, we call and in the past, when we started arguing, he would end the call before he went to sleep but he started to stay and passed out on the phone with me. I was under the influence a few nights ago and called him telling him about how much I love him and want him back asking questions about how he felt. he doesnt like when Im under the influence of alcohol because of the problems from the past and that when I did the amount I was drinking scared him but I had a higher tolerence then most and it took 2-3 times as much as others to get me buzzed/drunk. But during this call he was kind the entire call and understanding and didnt give me hope for a future with him. He was so patient, even the next morning when we talked about it. \n\nHe always talks to me when things are bad in either of our lives and we were calling one day and he made me start dying of laughter and he wanted to video call just to see me laugh. So we did and he stayed on for a while but my sister was making it awkard and hard to talk because she kept talking over him but he still stayed on the phone. He really cares for me and wants the best for me. He is ALWAYS there when things are bad and has done whatever he can to make me laugh and smile when Im hurt or sad. I do the same things for him and he comes to me when he is mad or upset about something. \n\nI really miss him but he has told me he has given up on relationships all together because hes scared of hurting them and being hurt (because of what happened with me and him). He says he loves me but only as a bestfriend. When me and him talk we are always our truest selfs. I feel most like me when Im talking to him and its the same for him. He has been stuck in his head for months because thats what the military makes you do.\n\nI absolutely love being his bestfriend but being with him was the greatest experience of my life and sometimes its hard to believe it wasnt just a dream. He even describes what we were as amazing before the problems kicked in. He even described life as perfect when we had been together after everything happened. \n\nIs there anything I can do to have him back one day? I miss him more then anything and hurting him has been my biggest regret. What can I do to help him see life outside of the military and see future possibilities not just with me but with anyone? I want him to be happy with someone even if it isnt with me (but most importantly him being happy on his own first).\n\nTL;DR - my ex who is my bestfriend has given up on relationships but I want him back, or at least help him hope and see life after the military.", "title": "My ex and my biggest regrets.

I\u2019d been thinking that I was going to ask her on a date once restrictions lifted in our city.\n\nBut yesterday we were talking and Anna mentioned her birthday was coming up, which was when I learned that she\u2019s only 25 (about to turn 26).

I respect his and my personal space. But atleast a text saying \"I love you\" \"I'll talk to you soon\" \"I'm fine\" in between our schedules would be enough which I obviously don't get even after texting them myself. \n\nNow, he has a job and I'm still at home preparing for job exams. I know jobs are hectic and I already knew we would get less time especially now that we are in a long distance relationship. Communication is really important, and I guess he doesn't understand this. His career is priority and I like that. Even mine is too but still man you can text in between your schedules to know how the other is doing or a simple I love you. If I text, I don't get any reply. I call, he doesn't call back and give excuses of being busy. If I do this with my friends, they always \"make time\" and call me even in between their job hours. \n\nI have some emotional needs. We all do. But recently I've been feeling overwhelmed and the only person I've been wanting to talk with isn't available much. It's like he does a formality of calling or texting me. Sometimes it feels forced but when I asked him he just said he gets tired af after working all day. I need him to listen a bit of my life and just comfort me a bit. \n\nTLDR : Is it too much to ask for ? Am I wrong here ? And if I am then please feel free to correct me. I don't wanna hinder his progress just cause me wanting a bit of his attention for my emotional thing.

We became really good friends, and it was very clear that there were no romantic feelings involved. \n\n\nThe friendship meant a lot to me. We experienced a lot together. We discovered new spots to eat, studied together, I knew her parents, grandma, little brother, baby cousin, boyfriend, etc... I helped her practice driving in preparation for her driver\u2019s ed test. We even transferred to the same 4 year university.\n\n\nWhen I turned 18 I started dating my now wife Shannon (currently 25F). My wife knew Heather before my wife and I even started dating. Shannon had a few interactions with her, but never was friends with her or anything like that. My wife never liked her. So when my relationship with Shannon started, our first big fight was about my friendship with Heather. Eventually I had to tell Heather that we couldn\u2019t be friends anymore. The friendship ended very abruptly and out of the blue from Heather\u2019s perspective.  I didn\u2019t really explain anything to her.. I just told her that now that I\u2019m dating Shannon, her and I could no longer be friends.\n\n\nI understand why I had to end the friendship. It\u2019s not the most straightforward thing to maintain a 1-on-1 friendship with another woman when the one you\u2019re dating doesn\u2019t like her. \n\n\nA few years ago, my friend ran into Heather. My friend told me that in their brief interaction, Heather talked a lot about how she misses me as a friend and she didn\u2019t understand what happened.\n\n\nI\u2019ve never really thought much about Heather since the friendship ended because from 18-25 my life has been full of many other things that have kept me very occupied. \n\n\nFast forward to present day. For some reason I can\u2019t stop thinking about her. I feel guilty for how things ended. I don\u2019t regret it because I know my wife was worth it and I couldn\u2019t have seen the friendship working in any way. But I do regret that I basically threw her to the side without looking back. I can\u2019t imagine how she felt. And now every day, I can\u2019t stop reflecting about all of the amazing, simple times &amp; memories we had when we were friends. It\u2019s like I pushed these memories aside for 7 years and now all of a sudden they are coming back. I feel almost mournful when I think about the situation.\n\n\nUnfortunately for the entirety of my relationship with my wife, I\u2019ve lied about the true nature of my friendship with Heather. The few times that I\u2019ve tried to be truthful with my wife about what my friendship with Heather was like, she would always get angry and jealous. So I just resorted to lying and telling my wife that Heather was not my best friend and we hardly spent time together, etc.\n\n\nHow do I deal with these feelings that I\u2019m experiencing? Re-friending Heather is out of the question. Speaking/apologizing to her is out of the question as well because of the potential for drama. And I don\u2019t know how to get any of this off my chest to my wife, because I\u2019ve made the mistake of lying to her all these years.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I had an amazing friendship that I abruptly cut off to focus on my relationship with my girlfriend/wife. 7 years later I regret how I dealt with it.

We have been married for almost 2 years together for almost 4. We got married and didn\u2019t have anything special, it was just us. We live in an apartment. Always, he has been with his thing about privacy etc. he\u2019s white, I am Latina. Of course, it was hard for me at the beginning because latinas we are really toxic... I gave it a shot. Over the years, he has never been a person to hide his phone or not let me using it. We would be lying down and he\u2019s using his phone in front on me so I learned how to trust him. On the first year of our relationship, he left his phone unlocked and I saw my opportunity to see through his phone (for many of yours that\u2019s not right, but for Latinos you better give your partner your password and that\u2019s it. I didn\u2019t feel bad for looking through his phone) and I didn\u2019t find anything.  I thought maybe he deletes everything but I was glad I didn\u2019t find anything. That happened a couple of times in over 4 years. \n\nLast night, he was falling asleep and his phone was unlocked, I woke him up but he was just really tired. On my mine, I was like should I? Shouldn\u2019t I? Like we say, if you look for it, you\u2019ll find it. He moved and his phone was still on the bed unlocked. I took it and started looking through his phone. I found out that he has 2-3 apps to talk to girls from other countries sex things... asking about pictures if they were real, being mean to some of them etc. I found a screenshot about one conversation on WhatsApp talking the same... when was the last time you had sex etc. One of the app was for dating the others were to talk like Snapchat. I looked for WhatsApp but he didn\u2019t have it anymore so I downloaded but didn\u2019t recovered anything.\n\nAlso, I found one screenshot of titis from one girl that he had since September 2020!!!!! \n\nI woke him up and I got crazy. He was trying to explain but I couldn\u2019t even looked at him. Anyways, it was midnight and got out of the apartment and he followed me and bring his car keys and told me to go in a ride that he was going to explain everything that I saw. We went on the ride and his explanations is that he was just being stupid trolling people. Like a scammer. He didn\u2019t have a profile picture in either of the apps. He didn\u2019t send pictures either. He swore on God that he was telling me the truth and that he wasn\u2019t getting anything out of it, it was just \u201chow far they would go with someone from the US\u201d he told me, \u201cyou saw that I didn\u2019t even have WhatsApp on the first place because I don\u2019t use it\u201d. We used before because I like it more than texting but he didn\u2019t. \n\nI know him, and I know that\u2019s something that he would do for fun. But I don\u2019t know if I should believe him. We live in Texas and none of them where here. They were from Nigeria and other countries. I\u2019m so confused because I don\u2019t want to be stupid and believed him but at the same time he didn\u2019t send pictures, he didn\u2019t have profile pictures and it wasn\u2019t Tinder.

He didn\u2019t tell me the nature of these relationships until *after* marriage, and even having a baby.

Long story short, the sleepover went pretty poorly, to the point where I threw up when I woke up and felt like shit all morning and had feelings of anxiety/stress. By the next day, after the sleepover was behind me, I felt perfectly fine after not feeling well the five days prior to the sleepover. From there, I had a long talk with her about the goals of the relationship and I felt like we had a bit of a resurgence.\n\nTo explain a little further, this is my first serious relationship, it's been four months as of yesterday and we are both 21. She's great. Genuinely not a thing I would change about her and the relationship has been equally as good. We have never fought, just small disagreements and she is very easygoing. She respects my schedule, doesn't demand anything from me and I see her when I can (I'm a student, she works). The last time we saw each other (this week), everything was fine, we went in the hot tub, ate, had some drinks, had sex, and then her sister picked her up. Seems great right? Well apparently not for me and this is where the problem starts.\n\nWe try and not speak throughout the day and then we call at night for 1-2 hours. Whenever I start thinking about calling her or even when the phone starts ringing, I get this weird tightness in my chest as if I was stressed or anxious. I find myself taking a lot more deep breaths when I'm on the phone with her and once everything has been said, lately I've just been wanting to end the call and our calls are getting shorter. Tonight she brought up sleeping at my house next week and that immediately made all these feelings of anxiety worse but obviously, I don't want to say no because I actually do want to see her and sleepovers aren't something we can do very often (she has strict parents).\n\nI guess what I'm trying to get at here is that I have some sort of relationship anxiety and I was wondering if anybody had any advice on how to deal with it or has experienced something like this before. To keep this short, I left out details so if you want to ask questions feel free. My friend suggested that I just try and push these negative thoughts out of my mind and look to the positives in the relationship, which seems like pretty good advice. Either way, if anybody has anything else to add I'm all ears, I can't go on like this with these feelings of anxiety that come and go.\n\n TL;DR: My GF who has been nothing but good to me gives me feelings of anxiety and I don't know how to deal with them because there is no reason I should be feeling this way.", "title": "My (21F) GF Gives Me Feelings of Anxiety/Stress and I Don't Know Why and It's Killing Me"}, {"created_utc": 1615996468, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m73iqk/how_can_i_recover_from_getting_dumped_on_my/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "How can I recover from getting dumped on my birthday?"}, {"created_utc": 1615996415, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m73i11/my_relationship_is_falling_apart_and_getting/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!

Little did she know that, thats not how things really worked despite my friend saying to her \"this is a small time community festival with drugs and drunk people, are you sure you want to go?\" she said yes and her dad booked her a hotel. \n\nSo basically today my friends told me she was extremely toxic and dangerous, on her way there with my friends she was speeding and lost her lisence, she can still drive for 28 days but after that it's a loss of lisence for 12 months.

I plan to finish college, get a career and move in together. My girlfriend and I get along really well except for when I talk to my ex girlfriend (24, F) who I was just trying to be friends with in the beginning of my current relationship. After much arguments, I decided it wasn\u2019t worth the arguing and decided to cut ties with ex. \n\nThen, a year ago, ex followed me on social media sites, so I say hi, long time no see, how are things, etc. We chat for a little about current life status then i end the conversation and delete it. However, I feel kind of bad that I deleted the conversation and had a secret conversation with my ex, albeit about nothing important. \n\nI tell my girlfriend, and at first she was calm but then later in the day as furious. Because i deleted the conversation she can\u2019t believe anything i said, so she thinks I have feelings for this girl that I\u2019m trying to deny. I tell her I don\u2019t and that I really don\u2019t have any interest in talking to her. After a week of talking she says she\u2019ll move past it but doesn\u2019t really forgive me until present time. \n\nLast night, my friend tells me that my ex wants to talk to me. I ask for what and he says she\u2019s been feeling down. So if we\u2019re in a three way call, it won\u2019t be that bad. I agree and we talk and joke for a while until ex tells my friend to leave. Friend seems reluctant, but leaves the call.\n\nShe asks how I\u2019m doing with life. I tell her it\u2019s been rough but I\u2019ve been trying to self improve myself by picking up new hobbies and working out, and I don\u2019t like to ask my girlfriend for help with my problems because I want to learn to handle things myself. \n\nThen I ask how she\u2019s doing. And she tells me about her depression and loneliness. She\u2019s been begging my friend for weeks now to talk to me and he really didn\u2019t want us to talk because of the past situation. She says she misses talking to me because I\u2019m the only one that understood her. She starts to bring up times like when we used to date and kiss and i tell her, you know. I\u2019m in a relationship. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s a bad person or girlfriend but i can\u2019t really talk about that stuff. \n\nShe goes on to tell me how life has been mundane and how she\u2019s felt like hurting herself and this causes alarm. So I try to stay on the line to convince her otherwise. After an hour or two she starts to bring up how much she misses me again and how she looks at my girlfriend\u2019s pictures so she can see me. Although flattered, I still tell her that I\u2019m in a relationship and that after this conversation I don\u2019t want to talk again. \n\nThen she says, it might be my ego talking, but I think you miss me too. I say no, I\u2019m currently in a happy relationship. She says I bet if you weren\u2019t in that one, you\u2019d want me and giggles while saying it. And this makes me feel sick. I tell her politely that it\u2019s time to hang up and we should never talk about this again. Now she sounds overjoyed but agrees to hang up. \n\nI feel sick. I\u2019ve gone behind my girlfriend\u2019s back to help this girl cope and she ended up disrespecting our relationship. I call my friend and tell him how I feel. He says my ex kept begging him to talk to me, and he agreed he\u2019d try only if he gets to stay in the call. He knew once she asked him to leave it was trouble. \n\nHe says I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I was faithful to my girlfriend and there\u2019s no need to tell her, but I still feel bad. I had another secret conversation and this time, it wasn\u2019t good. I promised my girlfriend I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with my ex. She forgave me for the last time but said if we speak again, then there\u2019s nothing left for out current relationship. Now keeping this secret is killing me, I hate hiding things from my girlfriend, but I can\u2019t come to tell her what happened. \n\nTL;DR\nEx begs friend to talk to me. I agree. Ex tells me she\u2019s lonely, and depressed and wants to harm herself. I try to talk her out of it. She says she misses me but I tell her I\u2019m happy in current relationship. She says I miss her and if wasn\u2019t in this relationship, I\u2019d be wanting her. \n\nMakes me sick, I hate hiding things from my girlfriend but I can\u2019t bring myself to tell her about this.

His job is causing a lot of strain but he needs it for the house. I was extremely unhappy in our last apartment and it culminated into me saying I was moving somewhere else with or without him. He wanted to stay because the rent was cheap which gave him more money to save for the house. We did end up moving.\n\nLast year after showing me countless houses, driving out to towns we might want to live in, listening to countless podcasts and reading every article out there he says he's going to talk to a bank. He keeps saying this week after week until there's only 2 weeks left to notify our landlord if we're moving which is something I had to bring up. His reaction was basically aw shucks guess I didn't realize the time which in my opinion was pretty bullshit.\n\nThis has caused a massive rift. Since then we've been having more frequent fights (he puts off the thing I've been asking him to do for months until i blow up and his response is to say if it was important why don't I do it myself, he doesn't come home at the time he says, if a coworker invites him to a party he dismisses my concerns on covid and joked if I got it I would be fine, to name the big ones).\n\nHe's been in therapy alone and we recently started couples therapy. Last session we talked about the house and how the process would require me to have outside conversations I really wasn't comfortable having right now. So, the week after, he gets a pre-approval and basically needs me to have those conversations right now. I've completely shut down since then.\n\nWe have another appointment tomorrow but I'm at the point where I do not want to put a single ounce of effort into fixing anything until he actually starts to make changes. I don't know what would need to happen right now in order to keep me from walking away which I know our therapist is going to ask me to think about. \n\nThe thing is whenever we fight he's always completely baffled and blindsided. He apologizes and claims he has no idea that these things are important. This last fight he was saying I was mad for not doing what he said he would and now I'm mad for doing it which...I think is a very simplistic view of what's happening. On a day to day basis we get along great. We've definitely had more good days than bad. However it's becoming more clear that this isn't a relationship and he's just living his life as he would with or without me.

I wanted someone to show me how to love myself or what to do to be happy, which I\u2019ve since learned how to do on my own. He took advantage of my insecurity by trying to control everything I did, down to what I ate. He was racist and misogynistic, telling me that as a \u201ccute woman of color, I\u2019d never have to worry about career prospects,\u201d so it was annoying when I\u2019d stress about my future. He\u2019d say terrible things about my family. He also started dating me right after getting out of a year-long relationship with another girl whom he was obsessed with towards the end, and she broke up with him because she was legitimately afraid for her safety (he had a restraining order against him that he lied to me about). It took me a long time to realize just how insecure he was about himself, and how codependent he was on other people to validate everything he did. \n\nAfter we broke up, I felt so free.

It made my heart drop because I remember how he told me that he had a fantasy of us living together after only a few months of us dating. I remember feeling flattered because no guy had ever wanted to do anything that serious with me before, but my conscience kept me grounded in knowing that was utterly insane. He also used to try and make me go on all these trips with his family during holidays and spend every ounce of free time I had with him.

My (34F) husband's (36M) aunt (66F) LOVES to bake and is a phenomenal baker.  Every Sunday, she brings a dessert like cake, pie, cookies, brownies, etc.  I always enjoy a small serving of her tasty dessert with our dinner.  They always send the leftover dessert home with us.  His parents are in their 70s and are both overweight and diabetic so his aunt wants to send the dessert home with the \"young healthy people.\"\n\nThis had been becoming a problem.  My husband and I have become very health conscious and have decided not to keep junk food in our home.  We lack self control around sweets and if it is in the house, we WILL eat it.  We have been making really good progress with losing weight by eating whole healthy foods and cutting out junk.  For months now, I have been trying to just throw away the plentiful dessert leftovers (half a cake, a dozen cookies, half a pie) once we get home.  But my husband struggles with guilt seeing our beloved aunt's hard work go into the trash.  He would rather eat it than waste it (even though it's being wasted by being stored as fat on our bodies when we overindulge).  So taking the dessert home with the intentions of trashing it has not been working.\n\nWe decided to tell his aunt that we can't take leftover dessert home any more.  My husband has a hard time standing up to his family (who are seriously wonderful people) if they are making a gesture out of love.  Like, she's sending the dessert home with us because she loves us so it's awkward for him to say no.  So at Sunday dinner, I politely \"made the announcement\" that my husband and I can no longer accept the dessert leftovers, as much as we love them.  Husband nodded along with me in support.  We talked about how much progress we have made and all the changes we have made to our diets and all of the weight we have lost.  His family seemed happy for us.  \n\nAnd then an hour later...when it came time to leave and my husband was in the bathroom, his aunt tried to hand a freezer bag of cookies to me.  I left my hands at my sides and smiled and said something like \"Sorry, again, we can't take the leftover desserts home any more.  They are delicious but aren't good for us.\"  She seemed a bit upset and was saying his parents can't eat them and she doesn't want them to go to waste.  I made a lame joke about how there were more cookies for her then and we left.  \n\nThe next week, same thing happens.  Except she hands the dessert to Will while I'm in the bathroom and he feels too uncomfortable to refuse them because he doesn't want to hurt her feelings.  We get home and I want to throw it away and Will wants to eat it.  He eats it and then regrets it and laments his lack of self control with sweets.  \n\nThe next week, we have a bit of dessert with dinner.  Leaving time comes and Will has gone out to the car already.  Aunt tries to hand me half of a cake.  I tell her more firmly that we can no longer take the dessert leftovers.  Politely suggest she adjust to baking smaller batches so there is not so much leftover if nobody in the family can eat it.\n\nSo we get home and a little while later, our doorbell rings.  And Will and his aunt come walking into the kitchen...with the cake...talking about how she just stopped by to drop it off because her and his parents can't eat it.  \n\nI was mad.  Really mad.  Starting to feel totally unheard and disrespected.  So Will hands me the cake and I open the container and drop it into the trash right in front of her.  I said \"yeah, I've been telling you we can't eat it either.\"  I excused myself to the bedroom.  \n\nWill says she was really hurt, offended and cried a bit.  I don't know what to do here.  She is NOT LISTENING.  Will totally understands why I'm upset but it is painful for him to see his aunt upset.  I don't want to hurt her feelings!  I just want her to respect us!    \n\nSo, I want to resolve this before Sunday dinner because I don't like disharmony either.  I have never done something rude like that before but I have also never had someone stomp a clear boundary out of \"love\".  \n\nI think I should reach out to her and apologize but I'm not sure what to say.  I'm also not sure how to handle it if she keeps trying to push sweets on us.  One good thing is that Will has promised to be more supportive and hold our boundary instead of accepting sweets to spare her feelings.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nTL;DR My (34F) husband's (36M) aunt (66F) keeps trying to send desserts home with us after we have made it clear we don't want them.

Lucy\u2019s husband wanted to no part of a poly relationship so he divorced her. \n\nBrett and Lucy also found other partners, Riley and Ashley. \nThey started bringing them around the friend group and are really sweet people.\n\nSo we all have been hanging out at a group (on zoom or socially distanced of course) for the last year. Riley and Ashley have become well liked, welcome members of the group.\n\nAt first it was okay, but it\u2019s just been deteriorating and it\u2019s becoming unbearable.\n\nLucy is still furious that Edgar left her and is always taking swipes at him or talking about all the great sex she\u2019s having.\n\nEdgar will not speak to her at all anymore and purposefully ignores her when she\u2019s talking.\n\nAlice looks like she\u2019s on the verge of tears and will not even look at Lucy anymore. \nShe really likes both Ashley and Riley but shuts down for days if Ashley mentions Brett.\n\nEverything has been at a low simmer for a while but then two weeks ago it just **exploded**.\n\nWe were playing jack box and Brett answered one of the prompts and eluded to some really athletic sex acts.\n\nAlice took a swipe at Brett saying that \u201che wasn\u2019t in good enough shape to even be on top for more than a minute\u201d\n\nBrett then said that \u201che could be on top just fine with Lucy\u201d\n\nEdgar then swore at Brett, Lucy jumped to his defense, etc, etc. \nIt just devolved into a screaming match.\n\nSo now Alice is staying with us, Brett keeps calling saying how sorry he is and begging her to come home.\n\nEdgar is suing for full custody of his and Lucy\u2019s kids. \n\nAshley and Riley have both broken up with Brett/Lucy but Riley still wants to hang out as friends with Alice, Vincent, Edgar, and me.\n\nLucy blames us for ruining her life.\n\nI\u2019m ready to just help Alice with the divorce and never see Brett or Lucy again.\n\nVincent is hesitant.

He overcame the odds, went to college, got a PhD, and now has a high paying job which is very impressive considering that most people with his upbringing are unable to escape the cycle of poverty and drugs. Unfortunately, his younger sister did not escape the cycle. He harbors a lot of trauma from his childhood that he works very hard to hide. He has gone to counseling as an adult and I\u2019ve encouraged him to continue but he no longer wants to. \n\nAs an adult, he\u2019s very motivated by money. I make 60k he makes 125k and he\u2019s going to start making a lot more soon because he\u2019s getting a big promotion. He puts a lot of pressure on me to make more money and he frequently makes comments about how he \u201cpays the bills\u201d or \u201cputs a roof over our head\u201d despite the fact that I also work full time and have a decent salary (our finances are combined). When I call him out or get upset about it, he brushes it off and says he\u2019s joking or turns it on me, \u201cwhy can\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d. We recently bought a house and he has started making comments about he\u2019s the one paying for it. Furthermore, we have two small kids and he doesn\u2019t recognize all the extra work I do (invisible labor) that\u2019s obviously unpaid.

She\u2019s a huge overthinker and likes to make sure we never did anything wrong together, despite me telling her we\u2019re done and to just move on. I don\u2019t mind talking to her that much but I really still love her and it\u2019s hard talking to someone who doesn\u2019t feel the same way anymore.\n\nShe was the one who broke up with me and I recently found out why. We were having sex like usual and I did something by accident (slipped in when we were making out naked and then pulled out quickly). This caused her to freak out so much that she broke down and could barely look at me for the next week. She then broke up with me. It\u2019s now been over 4 months and she just told me the reason she freaked out so much was because she had some sexual trauma from when she was a kid and that brought back all those memories. I was shocked! I never had any idea about that because she always seemed so happy and enjoyed sex/being physical. \n\nShe\u2019s been going to therapy for a few months and the topic of us getting back together has come up, obviously she\u2019s still very shaken up by what happened so I told her I\u2019m willing to wait until she\u2019s back on her feet before we become official again, or do anything physical. I\u2019ve told her I\u2019m fully ready to just jump back in where we left off, but she thinks differently.\n\nShe says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone just yet because of what happened (completely understandable) so wants time to think and process everything while she\u2019s working her way back up to being the happy girl she used to be. This is where my problem starts: She just wants to be friends for now and says she really wants me to keep talking to her because she still has feelings for me, but she can\u2019t guarantee that we\u2019ll get back together in the future just because of the history and if she would even want to. She says things like \u201cI can\u2019t be loyal to someone I\u2019m just friends with, what if I find some amazing guy when I\u2019m ready to date again and I want to go on a few dates with him?\u201d. Despite her saying she wants me to keep talking to her and being here for her. \n\nIt would be so painful if she found someone else while we\u2019re still talking and I don\u2019t want to be in any more pain, but at the same time she says she really needs me to get better because I\u2019m one of the only people she trusts. I\u2019ve given her the option of \u201cif I\u2019m to keep being here for you I want us to stay monogamous to each other\u201d but she says she can\u2019t do that because she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019ll be able to. \n\nI\u2019m just so confused, do I stay and be the better person and help her get better, while also hurting myself in the process. Or do I just block her and never talk to her again. I want a second chance with her but I know if I just ditch her that would never happen, but at the same time, it hurts to always be there for someone who doesn\u2019t know what they want and when they\u2019ll want it. Does anyone have any advice?\n\nTLDR: My ex broke up with me because of mental health issues and now just wants to be friends until she figures it all out.

When I was done with my call, I opened up and started my book I had just been delivered today, and he eventually made his way back to the living room with the game. \n\n\nHe asked if we should order pizza, and I said yes and ordered us a couple pizzas, one he likes, and one I like. Another thirty minutes pass, and the pizzas are delivered, and while still playing his game, he asks \u201cSo which movie should we watch?\u201d And gave me two options to pick from. I normally have to ask him to do a movie night with me, and this wasn\u2019t planned, but I was onboard. But I had been working from 3am-3pm and it was almost 5pm at that point, so I honestly responded, \u201chmm, both are good options, but I\u2019m not sure. You choose!\u201d He doesn\u2019t usually ask to spend time with me like this, and while I was excited, I was too tired to make any more decisions today. \n\n\nBut instead of just picking one of those options, he tells me I have to choose, and that he offered two options, and if I don\u2019t pick one, we just won\u2019t watch anything. So I said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m in the mood for watching, I\u2019m really tired. I ordered the pizzas, so why don\u2019t you choose?\u201d And so he gets super sullen (meanwhile, he hasn\u2019t looked up from his game this whole time) and says, \u201cwell, then we\u2019ll watch nothing then!\u201d In an angry tone. \n\nSo I told him, \u201cthat seems kind of manipulative.\u201d And so now he\u2019s mad that I\u2019ve accused him of being manipulative. So I just quietly return to my book. Ten minutes later, he\u2019s making me apologize for calling him manipulative, and saying it was mean of me and uncalled for, and that he wasn\u2019t being manipulative. So I apologized. But he continues the conversation, still scolding me, so I say, \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just choose? I\u2019m honestly too tired to decide right now\u201d and he goes, \u201cI already gave you two options to choose from, you can choose from those, or we just won\u2019t watch anything. I\u2019m trying to do something here.\u201d (I think he means he thinks he\u2019s being romantic? Or clever?). So I just went back to reading my book. \n\nSo I guess what I want to know is, am I right to feel manipulated? And am I wrong for not just picking a movie and being indecisive? Why does everything always have to be my decision? Especially date nights! Everything always boils down to what I want. You know what I want? A night where I don\u2019t have to make every freaking decision. He even had me pick what he wants on his pizza. \n\nTl;dr.

But in the end one of us had Something crucial in his was which lead to an end.\n\nAbout me: i am kinda of an emotional Guy. In some discussions i am way to impulsive. Also i try my very best never to hurt anyone. Even If someone wronged me. I personally dont like confrontation at all. So most of of the time i am holding Back Most of my emotions.\n\nRight now I am again in a 3 year old Relationship. The Relationship started great. She was into star wars and it was great in total. But after the years there emerged some issues. For example we dont have Sex regularly. Also she became quite a passive and 'tiny\" Person. I happend that i dont have the Feeling anymore that she can back me up in an emotional way or that i can bother her with my Problems, because it feels Like that she ist not able to handle it. For example: at her Last Birthday during covid she wanted chicken from McDonald's. I was away for more than an hour to get it for her. After i arrived we saw that that Inside the bag for around 30 bucks, where no Chicken Nuggets. Her reaction was, that she sat her down unter her desk and hit her head against that desk for an hour. I couldnt do anything to Stop her.\n\nRight now Out Relationship feels more like a babysitting. Kinda all she texts, or tells me is about the food she wants or some Doggo stuff. And dont get me wrong. There is nothing wrong about that, but there is also nothing more, Like in an interest in me. Most of the time she is very sad, but also doesnt want To get any Help form outside. But for me, who Had to Carry that whole stuff, its Just too much. But everytime i want to Talk about the issues i have shes getting a Panic attack or starting to discuss in a such a personal way, i dont want to continue. This lead For me to the fact, that i could not talk about my Feelings because, in the discussion it feels Like they arent worth anything.\n\nAlso we dont have any Sex, because she doesnt want that physically Attention and also doesnt have it for me. The Last Time WE had Sex ist about 6 weeks ago. But for me that physical aspect of a Relationship is a very intimate was of showing my Love. But that missing of Attention leads me Into some self estime issues.\n\nIn Case U read that far here my question. What to do? I Love that girl. I rly do! But i also rly need also Something Else beside my love for her. I dont know if there is a future.

The original plan was that all four of us would stick together and find a new place once the lease for our current place ends. \n\nWell, one of my roommates \"John\" is a bigot. Not like crazy MAGA level, but his views are harmful and he's made it clear he isn't willing to consider other perspectives. It's almost comical that he is so blatantly racist, sexist, and homophobic/transphobic to his queer brown roommate (me). John waters down these views when he talks to our other roommates, so at first I hesitated to tell them how I felt for fear I would be told I'm overreacting and that John is just conservative. I've already tried talking to John about the things he says and I have made it clear that he makes me uncomfortable when he says something bigoted, but he'll just shrug and say \"well, I'm from Georgia\" (as if there aren't queer people of color in Georgia??). It is honestly so exhausting trying to teach someone who doesn't want to learn, and it's worse that he purposefully only forces me to listen to his BS but is more or less harmless to our white roommates. \n\nIt got worse over the winter break and it was just too much for me. I told my other roommates that I was planning on leaving the group once the lease ends because John makes me so incredibly uncomfortable. Turns out that my other roommates didn't like that he was doing that to me, and they said that they'd rather the three of us move on without John. I've already started looking for places and the three of us are all excited to move, but none of us know how to tell John that he isn't welcome to join us when we move. \n\nIt's going to be awkward no matter what because even if we don't tell him the reason why, it'll be clear that we don't want to be around him.

They weren't mature calm discussions...it was more angry arguing. Once (we hadn't had sex in 6 weeks) we were out and he made a comment about a woman dressed in a sexy outfit. I got very upset and we started fighting. I told him that if he acts low libido with me he better not be drooling over other women. It got escalated and I ended up calling him a pervert. He responded that if I \"didn't weigh over 200 lbs\" he might have more of a libido with me.

I got upset and he said he \"found it difficult going so long without sex all the time\" and that he used the pictures to masturbate to. I asked him why he felt he had to go without sex when I was there. He didn't really have much of an answer...just tried to blame me for various things about our sex life (but it felt like gaslighting because none of it was \"all my fault\" like he was trying to suggest).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce we started having sex and I said I'd be right back...I went to the washroom to grab some tissues.

I've asked him if he's maybe low testosterone. He says absolutely not...that he has a very high libido. I ask him where it is then, and he says I don't put any effort into getting him interested or \"looking good\". I told him I try...I said I do my hair and wear makeup and he kind of scoffed. Once we were out and saw a woman in a sundress and he asked me why I never wear \"hot dresses\" like that. I was really hurt because I actually do...and he apparently never notices. Also, she was about 19 and perfect and of course I don't look like that in a sundress.

I know based on the title it sounds bad but, I have a reason as to why I haven't told my friends about my boyfriend. This might sound complicated, but I was in a six year long abusive relationship with an ex boyfriend. It took him cheating on me to realize how bad he was and break up. But before we broke up, my dad succumbed to mental illness and lost our house. I had nowhere to go but my ex's family, and hardly any money, and so they took me in. I was very clear to my ex that I did not want to get back together. I was saving up and applying for jobs and preparing to move out but I was still stuck with my ex. His mother especially was extremely abusive to me and I had to work hard to live there in any sort of peace. In this time, I met my current boyfriend.\n\nMy boyfriend and I hit it off soon after we met. At this point, I had been broken up for well over a year with my ex. But I was still stuck in his house working on moving out. When my boyfriend then asked me out, I told him immediately that I wanted to explain my living situation to him truthfully and honestly. I told him that I was in my ex's house, and that I had an interview for a job and was moving abroad next year. I told him that if we were to date, I could tell my family about him (as in, my aunt, uncle, cousins and later my brother too. My parents are out of my life) but I was nervous about telling my friends. All of my friends are tied to my ex, and while I was still stuck in that abusive household I didn't want to chance it going nuclear and getting thrown out with nowhere to go and not enough money to live if my ex's mom found out I was dating someone else. I had to lie about visiting my boyfriend which was already very stressful and made me feel like I was doing something wrong. She would get angry at me if I was even just seeing a friend group I made that my ex wasn't in, constantly harassing me and my ex. I did not feel safe until moving out revealing I was in a relationship to these friends in case they told my ex and my ex and his mother got angry.\n\nHe knew this going in but I feel bad because it makes him sad. He wants to share online and everywhere about our relationship but I ask him not to (I am a very private person online about this kind of stuff even normally, I am not very open about my relationship to the internet and even to my friends I don't talk about it much). He would get sad about this a lot and I felt like I was being very unfair and a bad girlfriend even though I was very clear and honest about this right at the beginning. He worried that if we broke up it would be as if he never existed at all to my friends. He always talks about him wanting to reach out and talk to my friends and jokes about messaging them randomly and saying he's my boyfriend. He wants me to post about him online on social media and I had to ask him to make his social media private if he wanted to keep making posts about me because it was stressing me out thinking my ex might see. If he sees me messaging a friend or even to random strangers who comment on my posts, he always tells me \"You should tell them that you're with your boyfriend! Tell them about me!\" jokingly. A few times he would watch me message them and wouldn't stop pressuring me over and over to tell them about him because it would make him very happy and so I'd give in.  But I always tell him I was private about past boyfriends too and felt weird out of nowhere bringing up my relationship when, again, most people outside of my closest friends I literally don't talk about my personal life anyway. I expressed that even if they weren't directly connected to my ex, I still was stressed and scared that it could get back to him while I wasn't living in a safe place. All of my friend group is moved out of state anyway and there's Covid too so it's not like we could even hang out, so I didn't know why he kept pressuring me to want to tell him either.\n\nBecause of Covid, my job abroad got delayed. But thankfully I was able to move out of my ex's place and am in a safe place now away from that trauma and abuse. But, I'm still recovering, and because of my ex's connection to my friends I feel like I have not put enough time yet where I feel safe yet to share with them about my boyfriend. But the moment I moved out, my boyfriend was rejoicing that I could tell them about him. I feel so bad but I told him I don't feel comfortable yet and just want to give it some time, and I would feel really shitty if the second I moved out I revealed I had been in a relationship while I was living at my ex's. It just feels wrong and I still don't feel safe at the idea of the blow up it would cause. I know it must be unfair for my boyfriend but it just upsets him a lot to not be more public about it. But I really, really don't see the point when I'm not even actively talking to many people right now and they're all out of state anyway. But I know it must feel shitty to be in a relationship and have your partner keep you from their friends. But, because I've only just recently been able to move out of my abusive ex's place I just still don't feel safe and ready. The idea stresses me out so much but he just keeps asking and pushing and being (understandably) upset that I'm not going public. In a few months time I think I would feel enough time has passed and I feel safe and ready, but I feel so guilty and stressed in the meantime making him so sad. I do understand that and feel bad for putting him in this position, even when I was honest and clear about it from the start. What should I do? Am I doing something wrong by wanting to keep this mostly private still until I feel comfortable and safe sharing my relationship? \n\nTldr; I was stuck living with an abusive ex and his extremely abusive mother after I had broken up with him until I could afford to move out. In that time I met my current boyfriend and when he asked me out I told him my living situation clearly and honestly. He still agreed to date but has throughout our relationship expressed sadness at me only being able to share him with my family, but not my friends  until I moved out and was in a safe place because most of them are connected to my ex. He pushed and pressured me a lot and so I've told a few people even if it's stressed me out. Now that I've moved out safely, he immediately wanted to go public but I still need time to feel safe and away from abuse. I would feel shitty revealing it immediately. I am also a very private person anyway about relationships online while my boyfriend wants to share it everywhere on social media, which I have expressed makes me uncomfortable and I am not used to either.

With the breakup and the lockdowns and being stuck with my parents, and moving to a new city later this year to do in person school, it wasn't a good time for dating. In September I started grad school remotely. As the semester went on, a guy (24M) in my class started coming onto me. He's in person on campus. He wasn't aggressive, but was very kind and had similar interests. He wouldn't outright flirt with me, but he put in a lot of work to get to know me and was very sweet. Towards the end of the semester he asked to meet me over break. He didn't ask for a date, but just said he'd be in town and wanted to get together. I felt like it was 50/50 he was into me or just wanted to be friends, and I said yes. \n\nWe went out, and had a pretty good time. He's a nice/cute/funny/smart guy with similar interests. I wasn't sure how into him I was having never met him in real life. I also wasn't totally sure he was into me because he wasn't explicit. As dinner went on, I realized I'm not totally into him, he's just a little too outspoken/bold/ambitious and I like a guy who's a bit more reserved. He's not a bad guy or anything, he's just not quite my speed. At the end of dinner, he told me all the things he admires about me. I wasn't quite sure what to say so I simply said \"Yeah I can see the same things in you.\" He then asked to date me. I sort of froze and wasn't sure what to say, but knew I wasn't ready to date this guy, especially as we don't even live in the same place until later this year and the aforementioned reasons, so I just muttered out that I was seeing somebody.\n\nHe was disappointed, and just said that \"he's a really lucky guy\" and we went our separate ways. For perspective, I don't really know many people in the grad school. This guy is one of the popular guys and basically knows everybody. I texted him that night saying I had a nice time, and I look forward to seeing him in the future. He answered saying the same, and said sorry if he misread things, but he thinks I'm terrific, reiterated how lucky my (fake) boyfriend is, and asked for a shot if things change. I just said thank you and some cutesy stuff and wished him happy holidays thinking this would sort of be the end of it.\n\nThe new semester starts up again, and he starts texting again. We text a lot about our work/school/shared interests. Nothing inappropriate. Every now and then he would very mildly flirt with me (compliment about something I raised in class or being smart or whatever). I would sort of ignore or be playful but not totally reciprocate. We keep talking a lot. I just want to be clear this guy is very respectful and smart and polite\u2014he's not like sending me inappropriate stuff at all. He toes the line very carefully. \n\nBefore Valentine's Day last week he asked me if I had any exciting plans with my (fake) boyfriend. I answered that I was being surprised since I figured that would kinda be the end of that since I wouldn't have anymore details to give. He answered that a special person deserves a special surprise on V-Day. After this, shit hit the fan this week.\n\nOne of my few friends at the school is a girl in my class. We've been getting to know eachother and talk about all kinds of girl things. She asked me if I had a boyfriend and I said no, and said I'm not dating now since I'm moving to a new city soon. It turns out that this girl and the guy are close friends, and she told him this. In other words, he found out that I've been lying all along. Another girl told me what's been going on, and why the girls there are weird with me now. Basically when I told this guy I had a bf that night, while he left respectfully and we didn't talk for a while, he called up his friends looking for advice wondering how it's possible we talked for months and I never mentioned my bf and went out with him and let him bring me a present and flirted a bit if I had a bf all along (the answer is because I didn't and I gave a bad excuse to turn him down that backfired on me). \n\nThis guy is popular at the school, and has a lot of friends he talked to about this. They all basically concluded I'm pretty toxic for having done that (they assume I was telling the truth about having a bf). Now that I shared with the one girl that I don't word got to this guy, and from him to basically everybody, that I didn't, and I'm a player, and a not nice/manipulative person, and now people are shutting me out. To be clear, this guy isn't doing anything wrong per se. He just talks to his friends about his life, and people drew conclusions based on what, in retrospect, I can see sounds like a fucked up series of events. I just had no idea at the time that a simple thing would get blown up into this.\n\nSo now I'm remote, getting ready to move to a campus where people think these things about me, and I have no idea what to do or how to fix it. I feel like everybody hates me there now. I mean, it's not the worst thing to reject a guy that way, but if I talked to him for months and never mentioned my bf, and went out with him, that's kinda dumb to say I had a bf the whole time in retrospect, which makes people think I'm a player. Then when it was found out I lied, they think I'm manipulative and mean. I have no idea how to fix this situation. It's not a big grad school, so people talk, and this feels like hell. I don't want to transfer because I really can't, but I just really don't know what to do now.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.", "title": "I made a mess in grad school and I don't know how to fix it"}, {"created_utc": 1613695509, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ln27in/guilty/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Guilty"}, {"created_utc": 1613695460, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ln26va/my_25m_gf_25f_planned_on_cheating_how_should_i/", "num_comments": 56, "score": 1, "selftext": "We live together, she left on a trip and left her iPad I just gifted her.

It\u2019s a long story (or at least it feels long) but I\u2019ll try to get it out. \n\nThe girl I love left me to be with her somewhat-ex boyfriend/significant person. \n\nAbout 5 years ago, the girl and I met when we sat next to each other in class. There was immediate chemistry, but both of us were too awkward and anxious to act on it. We went the next 3 or so getting lunch every now and again, both knowing that there was something there, but never acted \u2014 she was seeing someone, then I\u2019d be seeing someone, etc. Timing was never right. \n\nThen, two years ago, we were able to start something \u2014 she had recently \u201cbroken up\u201d with her boyfriend and I was single. It started as drunken, weekend hookups, but then it slowly grew more and more serious. A couple of months in, I learned that she wasn\u2019t over her ex boyfriend, and that they had been talking about working it out. She was always honest about their relationship, and I didn\u2019t put my foot down \u2014 I was trying to be with her, but I figured half-being with her is better than not at all. But I made clear to her that I felt something real with her, and I know she felt the same for me.\n\nThe next year or so was essentially her bouncing back and forth between us. The whole time, we were getting closer and closer, and when it wasn\u2019t a sexual/romantic relationship, I was still her best friend, and she was mine. She ended up moving to NYC in august (I\u2019m outside the city) and we began our romance again, eventually becoming \u201cofficial\u201d in November. I knew that the ex boyfriend was still part of her life, but I had faith (naively?) that they could just be friends, and she could focus on her relationship with me. \n\nIt was heaven for a while, but soon his presence grew, and I felt something tainting our relationship \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t talk as much, she\u2019d be less affectionate, etc. \n\nAbout a week ago, she called me and said that she needs to see the ex boyfriend and that she can\u2019t be with me. I was apathetic and didn\u2019t fight it, and she went to visit him. After a few days apart, I leave her a voicemail clarifying my feelings for her: how much I love her, how important she is to me, and how I want to fight for her. We then resume our relationship more or less, ignoring the question of whether or not we\u2019re actually together. \n\nIt\u2019s eventually clear that something\u2019s gotta give -- I.e. she needs to choose. And she honestly bounces back and forth \u2014 she feels that the amount of history she has with him makes her feel like she owes him something, but part of her knows that it won\u2019t work out, which is why she also wants to choose me. She makes a point that she hasn\u2019t been fully invested in either of us for almost 2 years, it feels crushing, and that she can\u2019t keep being pulled in two directions. \n\nFinally, this morning she calls and says that she needs to let me go. She can\u2019t keep feeling guilty and torn, and that I don\u2019t deserve to be with someone who loves two people. And that is crushing, because I wanted nothing more than to forgive and work to move on together. She tells me that she can\u2019t be with me because she\u2019ll always feel guilty about breaking this other person\u2019s heart, and that she needs to see her relationship through with him to the end. \n\nShe asks me not to hate her, and that she wants there to be a time where we can be together, free from the obligations she feels now to this other guy. She doesn\u2019t ask me to wait for her, but says something like \u201cI genuinely believe our time hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201d I do believe she loves me and that she wants that time to exist.\n\nAt the end of the day, I know I deserve more than to be with some who is so split, and it kills me how much pain she was in, being pulled back and forth between us.\n\nI don\u2019t want to dwell on past decisions. I just don\u2019t know how to go from having this person be the most important presence in my life to nothing at all. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on \u201cright person, wrong time\u201d? I want to believe years from now, she and I can work it all out. If she does come back, should I let her in?

I'm twenty and I met a wonderful lady who is eighteen exactly eight months ago. I don't think either of us had any initial intention of becoming as close as we have. The caveat is we met each other online, and I am recovering from mental health issues of which are wholly disabling ocd and depression. \n\nI truly believe I love her more than I have ever loved just about anything.

I want to, too, but I don't think I'm well enough yet and we're long-distance which is another problem. Another problem is our young ages--I really want this one to work out. I have a very strong intuition about it. I do plan to travel to her city during the summer with a college research program there. Realistically I am able to handle a relationship, but I will be anxious about it (which I don't consider a factor here because I can handle anxiety if I need to)--and I won't be able to give it my all.

I was in an all boys school so my first brush with females was in college, but I didn't really felt anything special towards any of my female friends so I basically graduated with zero relationship experience. I work in branch of government that is strictly males as well so you can imagine how little contact i have with women. My wife was literally the first and only relationship i ever had. Weeks into my engagement i knew i made a mistake, but feelings of self worthlessness and self loathing that I have dealt with my entire life resulting from how my family treated me made just suck it up and continue with her, believing that no one will ever love me or accept me anyways. Over the time i realised what i've done, I married an exact version of my mother, a full edition with the same abuse tactics installed. To cut a long story short, I try every single day to please her but nothing is good enough of her. I could go buy for months without buying essentials for myself just to keep buying her everything she dreams off and showering her with gifts, I've been cooking her every meal for the last six years, I literally used to change her Father's diaper when he got into an accident and went into a coma for a while, I do my best to listen to her, support her and always be there for her and am still not good enough. On the other hand, she never cares about me or how am I feeling. And the sex, twice a month if I'm lucky. Trying to escape this prison, I applied for a scholarship to study a masters degree in the UK. After getting rejected at my first two attempts, I got it at the third attempt. I traveled alone and my wife stayed behind with our then seven months old daughter.  As you could imagine but for my surprise neither my wife or mom asked about me or how i was doing. Instead the occasional phone call i got from my wife was only to complain about something, and something really stupid like her mom cooked something she didn't like for dinner (yeah she got her mom to stay with her to serve her during my absence), and as long she had a good mood she wouldn't call or even answer my calls. \n\nHowever, during this year I made a ton of new friends. This made me realise that I could actually be a loveable person, and not a piece of sh** like my mom and wife led me to believe. I made best friends with a female colleague of mine, and quickly you could tell we had chemistry, but both of us never acted on it because Iam a married man, but It was pretty obvious that this wasn't a normal friendship anymore, or atleast I believe so. \n\nMarch last year I went back for a couple of weeks vacation, But airports closed down due to the pandemic. I got stuck for four full months at home with my wife during lockdown. Know my work made me very busy before so I never had spent that concentrated amont of time with her before. That paired with my new experience and the strong feelings I had for my friend made me for the first time consider divorce. After a few failed attempts of reconciliation, I took my bag and left, and she went crazy until she got me back and made all the promises that she will change. And as I predicted, nothing change. \n\nNothing made me feel a bit better than the thought of leaving my wife and go after my friend half way across the world and try my luck with her. But I can't because of my 2 years old daughter. I can't imagine leaving her, and I can't imagine my wife will be able to take care of her on her own, plus I'm afraid she wouldn't allow me to spend enough time with her. Am torn, and i keep telling myself your certain happiness with your daughter is definitely more important than your possible happiness with [the friend], and I should suck it up and raise my daughter right. \n\nSo please give me your adivce, Is it better for my daughter to live in a broken marriage or between two single parents? And I'm selfish or unfaithful to have this feelings for someone other my wife?

I clarified that I wasn't mad at her at all, and I shared music with her (she always replies with feedback on the songs I link). She has left me on a seen for about 16 hours now. \n\nShe has told me that she likes her space, and she is really independent. So, this is the reason I haven't followed up and double messaged. She is introverted and obviously needs her time. But is there something I need to address here or just wait it out for her to get back to me? Obviously this no contact kills me a little on the inside because I am not introverted, I get energy from people. \n\nArrggghhh!

She also said she's unsure if she is self-sabotaging because of her anxious-avoidant attachment type. I notice her libido is quite low, she brought up concerns about sex. I apologized for if I made her feel bad, I told her I'll improve. When she was telling me all this, it was out of the blue for me, I told her how it made me very anxious as my ex would do the same and break-up. I brought up my ex again whilst we were messaging last night, and she has left me on seen for the whole day. I don't know if I should spark up a convo or let her have her alone time.

You can check my account if youd like.\n\nI am 18F, my boyfriend is 18M, and the girl who likes my boyfriend is 26F. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 years.\n\nQuick background(summary of last post):\nMy boyfriend going to an MMA gym with this other girl. They have become good friends and text often. I accidently saw a text where she admitted that she liked my boyfriend. I confronted him about it and he showed me the text he responded with, where he ignored her confession. He also told her that he had a girlfriend and talked about me and showed her pictures.\n\nNow this is all fine and dandy, he perfectly brushed her off and displayed that he was a taken man to her. I think he handled that well.\n\nThe issues come with the fact that she likes him and continues to make moves on him. The other day, she asked him out to ihop. Luckily, my bf hates ihope so he had that excuse. But she was clearly asking him out for a date.\n\nAlso, i accidently saw another text (i know, i swear im never stepping close to his phone or ipad again) where she was asking about what his standards are. It went something like: \"so what are your standards???(asking for a friend of course haha!)\"\n\nTo me, she is still very interested in my boyfriend and i think that he should stop texting her. He could be leading her on by accident by giving her attention even while she is flirting. He still sees her at the gym four days a week, so he can still talk to her there and be friends with her. Its not like im trying to prevent them from being friends.\n\nEvery time i bring it up, he says that i need to trust him more. He says that she knows that he is taken so why would she hit on him. I explained that some people dont care, and that even if you are taken, she doesnt give a crap about me, so she is still gonna try to take you. He also brings up the fact that guys have had crushes on me while we have dated but he has never gotten jealous. The difference here is that i dont continue to text them after they have admitted it, and i dont put up with them flirting with me. I stop interacting with them so that they can get over me.\n\nSo heres my dilemma. I do have an issue with getting jealous. Most of the time, i keep it to myself and dont start drama because of it so it doesnt cause an issue. This time, however, my jealousy is just too strong and i want some reassurance and i want him to stop leading her on. Is this something that i should listen to my jealousy on? Or should i let it go?\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTl;dr \nShould i be getting jealous that my bf is texting another girl that likes him?", "title": "Am I justified to be jealous that my bf(18M) continues to text a girl(26f) who likes him?"}, {"created_utc": 1623160755, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nv4nex/is_it_bad_to_get_jealous_that_my_bf18m_continues/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Is it bad to get jealous that my bf(18M) continues to text a girl(26F) that likes him on a daily?"}, {"created_utc": 1623160753, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nv4ndw/my_coworker_18f_is_infatuated_with_me_28_and_im/", "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "selftext": "I think this girl is literally infatuated with me because she seems to ignore the fact I find talking to her about certain things inappropriate.

I thought she took the hint but she obviously makes her own reality.\n\nYesterday she texts me that she's out drinking after getting her bloods taken to see if she can go on birth control/the pill. Yeah nothing suspicious going on there. The says there's \"another male\" annoying her, I said to \"get your mates to keep unwanted advances away\" and she said \"it's a long story flip sake he's a dick\" but didn't want to be rude to him but told him she \"was on her period sorry\" and how he wanted to have sex while on her period or something I couldn't make heads or tails about what she was actually trying to say. Then talks about \"that's when the hormones are the best\" complete with a love heart emoji, how she broke up with her boyfriend, (FWB or actual boyfriend? does she even know the difference?) played UNO in his car before he got angry/horrible and she left.\n\nI literally told her I really shouldn't be talking about sex with her as it wasn't appropriate.

I'm almost non-existent on social media for a reason!\n\nI haven't made posts about everything that happens in my workplace but I have made a few the past year since it's rather bothersome. A temp literally asked me to come back to her place in an entrapment ploy to get me alone like wtf. Before that there was a co-worker who I was genuinely interested and it seemed like the feeling was mutual but there was obviously something wrong about her. Pretended (I later found this out) to be dating her neighbour after telling me that her mother was looking forward to meeting me and wanted me to come with her to visit her family. Probably though it would make me want her more but it backfired because I ended up blocking her then she interrogated me about who I was dating (at the time) and wanted to see pictures of her. She quit not long after. Like wtf creepy.\n\nRecently as well there was another co worker (20F) who tried to wrap her legs (jumping hug) around me when she gave me a farewell hug after I gave her a present (she deserved it), we won't see each other for 4 months and are genuinely friends and probably will be even a decade from now.

Also this is stuff that has kinda only just happened so might be a bit muddled/rambly.\n\nHe texted last night asking if I was free. I said I was ready to crash but that he was welcome to come over for cuddles/sleep if he felt like it. Really wasn't expecting him to be up for it but he showed up not long after.\n\nHe seemed a bit calmer than usual and as far as I could tell he wasn't drunk or high, he was being really cute tbh. I asked him if he was okay with not fooling around, he said he didn't think he was all that bothered actually and maybe he was just feeling a bit lonely. Kinda makes me wonder if he's sometimes just hooking up with me/other people because he wants some company - I know that's not super unusual, but it still makes me really sad. Makes me feel like a bit of a dirt bag too. Because of how beautiful he is, I think I've also kinda assumed that the power dynamic between us swayed in his favour but not sure that's really the case at all.\n\nWe hung out and talked for a bit this morning. He was a bit more willing to talk about his mental state though still pretty guarded. He apologised for worrying me and said he generally doesn't expect people to notice or care but should have been more aware of how he affected me. He said there's medication he's supposed to take but he hates it because it makes him really sick, but he's also getting really fed up with feeling and behaving the way he does. He said he knows something needs to change but he hasn't decided yet what his next step should be.\n\nI told him that if he likes, I would be very happy to be there for him as a friend but we probably shouldn't be hooking up while he's figuring this stuff out, for both our sakes. I think he assumed I was just cutting him out and trying to be nice about it, I tried to reassure him that that's not what I'm trying to do but who knows if he believed me or even wants that kind of support from me.\n\nI hope he takes me up on my offer, I'm not sure how many people he has in his life rn who are looking out for him. Time will tell I guess. Tbh I feel like a real bastard for not addressing this sooner, sure we weren't in a relationship but that doesn't mean I had no responsibility to make sure he was okay.\n\nSome questions, if anyone has any advice...\n\n* how realistic is it to transition from FWB to F w/o B? Obviously there's certain situations it would be sensible to avoid. Tbh I only trust my own willpower so far.\n* is there any good places to get advice on supporting a mentally ill person? I don't have loads of experience in this department and I don't want to end up doing/saying the wrong thing if he decides he does want my help.\n* if I don't hear from him again should I check in or just assume he's made his decision?

We have history together. I know that he thinks of me as his world, and his everything. There\u2019s no question of how much he loves me. However, he also tends to be a looker.. he watches porn, looks at other women. I\u2019ve never been this insecure in my life, till we started seeing each other. \n\n\nLast month I had a terrible dream that he cheated on me with a stripper. It messed with me so bad that I had to look at his phone. On the rare occasion that I look at it, it\u2019s usually just to see what kind of porn he\u2019s looking at, what kind of girls he seems to like and what they\u2019re doing that I\u2019m not doing for him. I decided to take it one step further and look at his Facebook messages. Mostly just his guy friends and old friends that are girls from high school, no big deal, I didn\u2019t read those. However, as I was scrolling downwards I saw a particular girl he\u2019d messaged last month and I clicked on the message conversation because I saw \u201cokay baby.\u201d I was shocked. My bf is just as adamant as I am that talking to friends of the opposite sex in a flirty way like that, is cheating. The messages of course were flirty. He was the one flirting with her, not even the other way around. He was calling her baby, telling her he always thought she was cute, and asking her if there was any chance he could take her out. I think she turned him down politely, I don\u2019t remember. He\u2019s not friends with her on Facebook, she\u2019s not the most attractive but not bad looking either, and the only other time he ever talked to her was to tell her happy thanksgiving last year.\n\n\nI\u2019m past it for the most part. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have anything to defend himself with, but he told me when I confronted him that he was drunk that night. He got blacked out drunk, and he didn\u2019t even remember talking to her. He is an alcoholic so I know and trust that he was drunk that night. When we talked about it, he told me that when you\u2019re blacked out drunk, you\u2019re just on autopilot and you do things that you wouldn\u2019t ever normally do or want to do. You do things that don\u2019t make sense and you don\u2019t know why you do the things you do or say. I\u2019ve seen him blacked out drunk, so I know what he\u2019s talking about. But at the same time, I don\u2019t understand it. If he didn\u2019t have any secret crush on this girl or any reason to talk to her and flirt with her in this way, why would he have felt the need, even while blacked out drunk? If you truly had no intentions like this, you wouldn\u2019t do it drunk. Or at least I would think. Under other circumstances, of course, this wouldn\u2019t have been something to easily forgive. He told me he does not like her, thinks she is trash, and that he never would have talked to her otherwise. He told me I\u2019m perfect for him, and that he\u2019s not bored or unhappy with me when I asked. And I believe he\u2019s not; he always wants nothing more than to spend time with me when he\u2019s not at work. I\u2019ve blacked out when drinking just once in my life, so I don\u2019t know how this works. His drinking doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior; but he still had a defense that made sense to me and in his defense, he wouldn\u2019t have done this otherwise.

We live together.\n\nI am basically sitting on a slowly increasing pile of irritations that I have no idea how to raise. These are mostly (but not all) related to grooming/hygiene. I won't give a comprehensive list, but;\n\n* I dislike facial hair. D has a beard, which I have never said anything about because, end of the day, it's his face. However, he rarely takes care of it, and frequently lets his moustache grow over his lips so I get straggly moustache hair in my mouth when we kiss. If I'm lucky, it'll be Coke-flavoured, or whatever else he's been drinking. I struggle not to gag, every time.\n\n* D has a monobrow. Early in our relationship, I very lightly and casually offered some options for fixing this (plucking, waxing, shaving). He allowed me to fix it once or twice, but expressed indifference at doing it himself. I refuse to continue doing it for him on principle, so now I just try not to look at it.\n\n* D has mediocre hygiene. I shower roughly 2-3 times a week. D showers roughly once every two weeks, sometimes less. He also frequently wears the same jeans for ~1 month, and will only change them when I tell him to. He is fundamentally disinterested in his own hygiene. Somehow, he doesn't smell - his clothes start smelling before he does. No clue how. I have frequently asked him why he doesn't shower more; he looks uncomfortable and says he \"doesn't like/enjoy showering\" and \"it's a pain\". Bafflingly, he religiously washes his hands thoroughly every time he goes to the toilet.\n\n* D is a messy person. We have a long double desk for our computers. While mess is mess, and my side gets messy too, D has no concept of putting things away and his side of the desk will gradually accumulate more clutter in perpetuity until I tell him to put things away.\n\nThis is about to get sexual:\n\n* D is, no other way to put it, bad in bed. We do not do any foreplay. He rarely touches my vagina without being expressly told to do so (not that I often want him to, considering how dirty his fingernails usually are). His idea of sex is lots of kissing and roughly grabbing my butt/boobs, then doing missionary until he cums. I find our sexual encounters incredibly boring.\n\n* When we first met, he was a virgin. Our sex life was actually fine for the first few months because I went out of my way to help him feel comfortable and guide him through the whole thing and not put pressure on him to make me cum. It seems, unfortunately, that he has now learned - like a baby bird - that all sex is like that.\n\n* Even now, after nearly 3 years, he is incapable of putting his penis into my vagina by himself. I have to do it every time. It's an enormous mood killer for me. Last time we had sex, he mounted me, paused, looked at me in consternation for a second, then took my hand and moved it to his penis for me to \"line him up\". It took all of my willpower not to shove him off and tell him I was not his fucking mother and was not going to hold his \"hand\" anymore.\n\n* Recently he has become insecure about the fact that we rarely have sex. I have no idea how to tell him that it's because he's bad in bed and I have lost all interest in him as a sexual object because of it.\n\nSo, why have I not told him all of the above?\n\nD has severe problems with anxiety and low self-esteem. Whenever we have any kind of serious conversation, about anything, he catastrophises that I am breaking up with him. He cries, every time. If I bring up even *one* of the points above, he will cry and feel bad about himself for hours, if not days. If I bring up all of them, I have no idea how long the depression cloud would last.\n\nWhen this happens, I invariably have to take care of him to get him back to normal, or he will continue to catastrophise and assume I don't love him anymore.\n\nI have brought up some of the issues above before, in a very casual, careful way. He said he'd do better and then nothing changed.\n\nI feel stuck. I have no idea how to address any of this. I've been sat on these issues for almost 18 months, some of them longer. I know we need to have a conversation about it, but I can visualise how it's going to go in my head and it's a miserable picture.\n\nHelp?\n\ntl;dr my boyfriend has awful grooming standards and is mediocre in bed but I have no idea how to talk about it without him having an anxious tearful breakdown.", "title": "How do I go about bringing up issues with my partner's behaviour?

He\u2019s 26 in August and she\u2019s 21. She\u2019s a shareholder in his business - he founded it and she came on board shortly afterwards. They\u2019re slowly becoming successful. They are obviously very close, talk every day and she is involved with his family and even his friendship group in his city. I was heartbroken and our trust was lost when he told me, as we had discussed her many times before and we had talked extensively about past relationships, as I\u2019ve been in emotionally abusive relationships and wanted him to know it might be hard sometimes. I stayed with him because I loved him and didn\u2019t want this to ruin what we had. He told me he wanted to be with me forever and he didn\u2019t want to be in love again until he met me. He said he\u2019d never had any feelings for her and it was an agreement between the two of them that it was just physical. \n\nNobody apart from me knows about their affair. I have been struggling with it for months because I\u2019m the only one who knows and no one else understands why I may feel uncomfortable at her heavy involvement in the non-career areas of his life. It also felt like if it was kept a secret they would be able to do whatever they wanted. He had a habit of not mentioning her or hiding things to do with her in case I became upset. I have met the girl twice and we were cordial and it was reasonably pleasant. \n\nI tried desperately to trust him again and fought through the pain I felt, but it\u2019s caused a lot of disagreements. He was always very defensive about the situation and wasn\u2019t really willing to do much about it, telling me it was a problem within me I needed to deal with. He made a fuss for my birthday about 3 weeks ago, bought me a guitar and took me out and we got on really well. However, we had some difficulty because they were holding a company event that involved just the two of them, my ex\u2019s parents and his sister and her boyfriend. I felt weird about this, rightly or wrongly. It seemed inappropriate to me given the nature of their relationship. \n\nI told him it would make me more comfortable if others knew. He flat out refused to tell anyone. I suspect his parents would be very disappointed as they are quite heavily involved and they probably provided money to start the business as they are very wealthy. It is obviously very unprofessional and they would think of him differently. I also asked if he could do a couple of things so I felt safer, such as not drink together alone or go alone to each other\u2019s homes. He said these things would solve nothing - the problem, according to him, was that I did not trust him and that was my problem. He also said that this girl made \u201cmost of\u201d his living and that the business would always come first.\n\nShortly after I asked for these things, he broke up with me, saying there was no way to fix things and he couldn\u2019t keep causing me pain.

No guys whatsoever. He claims he's been trying to find guy friends, but he says he doesn't like being friends with or talking to guys because \"guys suck\" and \"they're hard to talk to\" (weird, I know).\n\n\\*\\*ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE IN AN EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP\\*\\* (21M, 19F)\n\nI honestly do not have a problem with my S/O having female friends, but there are boundaries, and I don't think my bf or his girl friends have really respected those boundaries. For starters, he hangs out with them one-on-one, *alone.* Not even in a group. He also has these meetups without telling me - for example, yesterday I FaceTimed him and he picked up in a kind of *sus* looking room. It was kinda dark, and he said \"I'm with my friend\" in a very giggly manner and he flips the phone so she can see my face and I can see hers, and **I could not even pretend to be nice**. Not to be that girl but his female friends aren't the best-looking either. My discomfort and maybe even disgust was written all over my face. I quickly hung up and he texted me a few minutes after asking if I was alright and I had to pretend that everything was fine. I said I didn't want to interrupt and he said I wasn't, and the he wanted to keep talking to me, but I was obviously not in the mood to. I got my 2nd dose of my COVID vaccine yesterday on top of excruciating menstrual cramps so I nearly passed out after the call. I've been sick to my stomach since. I also haven't spoken to him since yesterday afternoon.\n\nI know I may be overreacting in some people's perspective, but as someone who has been cheated on several times. and has severe relationship trauma, these kinds of situations are EXTREMELY triggering for me.\n\nThe reason why I didn't confront him right away (which I would've done in any other relationship) was because I've expressed my discomfort about these things so many times, but he hardcore defends his friends, saying that I'm just paranoid, and that he's trying not to get to a point where he would have to choose between me or his friends. So I've just given up at this point.\n\nSecond, if you didn't read my last post (which I highly recommend you do for context purposes), he's very close with this girl from Canada, and we live in the US. He met her online, and they text and FaceTime 24/7. She calls and texts him nonstop when we're hanging out, constantly asking him if he's home yet and if not when he's gonna get home. Keep in mind this girl also has a boyfriend. In my last post, I also mentioned that my boyfriend has A LOT of pictures of her saved on his phone...some are just \"goofy FaceTime photos\" (as he calls them), but some say otherwise. Not anything too bad, but it still does not sit with me right. He has also had group FaceTimes with this girl and another girl without telling me (I found out after, he's not good at hiding things). We had a big fight about it and he says he's wanted to invite me, but he was afraid that I \"would be mean to them\". He's invited me a few times since, but I don't have the energy or time to talk to this girl, I physically cannot.\n\nReddit, you know what to do.

We are engaged for almost 2. When I met her, she was still with her ex. This was back in 2019. I fell in love with her instantly and she did with me. Subsequently she broke up with him. She tells me that she was thinking of leaving him anyway and was not feeling fulfilled in her relationship with him. We then had to go our separate ways because we were doing long distance.\n\nWhen she went back home, her ex tried to get back together with her, they went out and i only recently found out they spent the night together and slept in bed together. She tells me nothing happened. About a month later she was telling me she's not sure about us because she doesn't see it working and the next day she apologized. Cool. About a month later or two, I find out they went out the night she told me that and he kissed her, but she insists she felt nothing.\n\nWe got engaged after and continued our relationship. Funny thing is, that whenever she speaks of him, she goes into such detail and really puts him on a pedestal. Sure. He must have been a great guy no doubt.\n\nThat's ok. But whenever he speaks to her about something, he criticizes her and she takes it very badly. It really gets to her. I know he blames me for their relationship failing and I think that he keeps trying to manipulate the situation by making her feel like she's not good without him. They don't speak a lot, but when they do, he keeps hinting at them being back together.\n\nShe hasn't told him to this day that we are engaged, and she says it's not his business. I have however, told my ex.\n\nSo in the days past, her exes dad passed away and he called her first and told her she will get an invitation to attend the funeral. In his conversation with her, he attempted some light flirting and compliments and asked to see her and spend time with her in the coming weeks.in fact he never moved on after they broke up.\n\nHis dad was dear to her which I understand, and she keeps crying and telling me that the man wanted grandchildren and that he never got them and she's so sad about that. Obviously he wanted her to be the mother of his grandchildren.\n\nBecause she was so down, I called her to comfort her and when she told me how her ex was acting, I got upset and expressed that I was and I apologized because he lost his dad and she said he was vulnerable.\n\nI feel like I am being a jealous asshole and I feel really stupid and don't know if my concerns are valid or my thoughts playing tricks on me. I don't want to trash talk her ex but I'm feeling rather helpless and alone.\n\nMy feelings aren't valid at this stage because she needs to support her ex. I just don't know what to do. Should I just be silent and wait for it all to pass? What do I do to get over my feelings?

We were just sitting there, he was playing with my hand then he suddenly gave me a high five; not the simple high five with the sound of a clap, he hit my hand against his hand pretty hard and it hurt. So bad. I've been driving my motorcycle for hours before I went to see him so my hand was pretty sore. He was laughing and I thought he wanted to goof around so I hit him back playfully (with my other, non-dominant hand). Next thing I know he shouted at me for hitting him. It was abrupt and I didn't know how to react. I froze and just sat there. This was the first time he shouted at me. I moved a few inches away from him so I could have some space for myself but not too far so he'd not notice. I didn't want him to know that he scared me. We were quiet after that but I was pretty shaken up so I started tapping my arms and knees to keep calm while he was just looking around. Some time later, after I calmed down, he asked if we should go get some food, I said okay and we decided to go walk to a fast food chain. He took my hand again and put it around his arm (I didn't mind, he always does this and it's kinda sweet) and we went on our way. I didn't realize I was still tapping, I only did when he shouted at me again. It seemed that I was tapping on his arm pretty hard and it hurt him so I apologized. I felt humiliated since we were in public. I let go of his arm and walked faster, at this point I was pretty rattled because he shouted at me again and frustrated at myself because I'm letting him. I wanted to run and just go, but he had my bag so I couldn't. I walked a few steps in front of him so I wouldn't have to interact with him, and he just noticed then that something was up. When we reached the fastfood, he ordered our food, ate silently, then we went back to the park. Screaming and shouting scares me the most and it makes me anxious and he was the last person I expected to shout at me. When we got to back to the park, I told him to not shout at me, but he just brushed it off and said he wasn't even shouting. After a little while, he told me he was sorry I thought he shouted at me and if he scared me. We were quiet again after that. I apologized again for hitting him then asked if he wanted to go home. He agreed so we went home.\n\nI have to know, am I the one in the wrong here? Also, what should I do to make it right? And what should I do so this kind of stuff never happens again because I really don't want him (or anyone) shouting at me for no good reason.

I would always plan our dates, make exclusive time for her everyday and made it a point to tell her how I felt about her.  Over time, she told me that I was smothering her and that I was being too clingy.  Not going to lie, that hurt as I felt I was just trying to be a good and supportive boyfriend.  From that point on, I made it a mission of mine to start being less clingy and more nonchalant.  I started calling her less (once every two days), started seeing her maybe once or twice a week and dedicated more of my free time towards myself (gym, sleeping, writing screenplays) and my guy friends.  Fast forward to now, she is upset that I don\u2019t show her enough attention and that I seemingly don\u2019t care about the relationship.  She claims that while she does think that I love her, she feels as if I don\u2019t act like it. She for the most part initiates the conversations now or plans dates, and I don\u2019t say I love you unless she says it first.  She confronted me about it the other day and I told her that I do in fact have feelings for her, she is being overdramatic.  I told her that I\u2019m only doing what she asked about me being less clingy.

My dad died when I was 12 (exactly 8 years ago today actually) so it was just us until this October when she got a boyfriend whose now her fianc\u00e9. My mom makes my mental health SO much worse. And I\u2019ve even been on the edge of calling what I\u2019ve been through since childhood mental abuse which everyone outside of the family agrees with, but no one inside the family would ever agree with me bc they wouldn\u2019t dare cross her. \n\nI have anxiety, depression, anorexia, chronic suicidal ideation, a heart problem, a paralyzed stomach (feeding tube), and I\u2019m currently being tested for brain inflammation/ autoimmune encephalitis. Needless to say, I\u2019m not well. My dog that I\u2019ve had since I was 7 passed away a few months ago and I took it really hard because she was there through everything. Luckily, my soon to be step-sister moved in only 2 weeks after my dog died and brought her own dog into the house. He helps me so much but he\u2019s locked in her room when she\u2019s not here and my mom says he\u2019s not allowed in my room. And my step- sister moves out in early august for vet school and doesn\u2019t come home besides for Christmas.\n\nBack when my dog was dying, my therapist suggested an ESA. I knew my mom would never go for another animal so I didn\u2019t mention it. But recently, I\u2019ve been so terrified all the time and so anxious and suicidal and depressed that I feel an ESA cat would do me a lot of good. I calmly explained to her in the car what my therapist and I talked about and all of the benefits that having a cat would do for my mental health. (And my physical health. She\u2019s the first one to say that if you\u2019re negative, your symptoms get worse- even though my symptoms aren\u2019t related to anxiety). She shook her head the whole time I was talking and said \u201cI\u2019m leaning towards a definite no\u201d when I asked why, she said \u201cI don\u2019t want a cat jumping on the tables and getting hair everywhere.\u201d I explained that I will clean up after the cat and even vacuum the couches every day and sweep. I told her the type of cat I want (Russian Blue) is known not to shed a lot. And to that she just said \u201cI said I\u2019ll think about it. If you keep talking about it, the answer is no and I won\u2019t think about it. How\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nNote: I told her and she knows this that if I were to get a cat now or even for my bday in less than a month,  it will come to college with me in September and I\u2019m moving out with my bf in the spring so she will barely have to deal with this cat. Just for a month or two before school and a few months until I move out.\n\nI\u2019m just crushed because I feel like she\u2019s putting a bit of cat shedding over my therapist- suggested ESA that will do a lot of good for me.\n\nTW: I tried to kill myself 3 nights ago with pills but it didn\u2019t work and she still doesn\u2019t know. I really think if I had a cat laying with me at that moment or knew they\u2019d have to be taken care of, I\u2019d have second guessed it. Instead, I\u2019m here 3 days later wishing it worked. \n\nHow can I get my mom on board with me adopting an ESA cat?\n\nTL;DR: me and my mom fight a lot, she\u2019s borderline mentally abusive.

When/where I grew up, you could date other people, but when you  started having sex, it (in my mind at least) became monogamous. I went  out with a girl, 37, a couple of times, and then we started having  amazing sex. We also started texting throughout the day ... and we'd  spend non-sex time together, during which she'd talk about things that  she wanted to do with me, like to go on vacations, etc.\n\nDuring this three-week relationship, she has made it clear that she is seeing other people. I have not objected.\n\nLast  night, I asked what she's been up to and she told me she had been on a  date with another guy. I told her I felt jealous, and we talked more  today.\n\nI tried to discuss my  feelings of jealousy and make a distinction between the concept of  \"seeing other people\" and \"seeing a specific other person.\" My position  is that I am okay with the vague concept of seeing other people, but  when it is a specific other person, I feel jealous and competitive.  Ultimately, I asked her to be discrete with me when she's seeing other  people. Like, saying \"I went out to dinner with a friend\" as opposed to  \"I had drinks with a Danish guy who is an international reporter.\" She  did not see that distinction between the abstract and the specific. I  feel like she's maybe intentionally not trying to see that ... am I  wrong?\n\nWe talked about my  interpretation (from her perspective, misinterpretation) of the  relationship (she does not like using that word, and suggested  \"situation) as intense. She said our relationship, which involves daily  communication and frequent sexual encounters, was not intense for her.  Where I'm from (the southern part of the Atlantic seaboard), you may  date multiple people, but, once you start having sex with them, it's  assumed to monogamous.  Is that concept outdated? Am I wrong about the  level of intensity?\n\nAlso, we  talked about the relationship, and she suggested that it was the sex  that occurred to quickly and that was what I confused with intimacy. I  told her it wasn't the sex, but the day-to-day texting\u2014like \"hey, how  are you doing?\" that I interpreted as intimacy. I mean, it's one thing  to fuck, but it's another thing to fuck and talk about your day. To me,  the former is fucking and the later is intimacy.

Needless to say, there is a pretty large income gap. \n\nIn the past few weeks, my girlfriend has been getting uncomfortable whenever I pay on dates or spend large amounts of money on her (I never spend more than I can afford).

She feels sad because she knows she can't go out and spend the same amount on me (once again, I don't expect her too). She said she doesn't feel worthy of me. I reassured her and told her I will always love her; she shouldn't feel like she has to buy me something just because I bought her something. \n\nI am just confused.

I love him, I want to be with him, but there are so many issues and I know it's bad.\n\nHe has so much anger and a lot of trouble controlling it. It was very bad before, but that was because he would drink. He doesn't drink now. But his anger still comes up (maybe once a month). It's not long-lasting, but it is over-the-top for whatever the situation happens to be. Swearing, raised voice, sometimes yelling, sometimes throwing stuff, usually blaming me...maybe once a month over something inconsequential or just everyday life inconveniences or a misunderstanding. It puts a black cloud over our day/evening and leaves me feeling anxious.\n\nHe also had an issue with flirting with women, and a couple of years ago he lied to me. I asked him about a particular woman I was suspicious about and he said he never talks to her privately. I asked if he would show me his phone, and he wouldn't. He acted upset and hurt that I was acting like that and that I wouldn't trust him. Well, in the end, it turns out he'd been texting her for months. Not fully inappropriate but definitely heading towards being emotionally inappropriate (complaining about me, downplaying our relationship, talking a bit about sexual likes/dislikes, saying he wants a woman who will appreciate him, showing her pictures of our house and saying she'd look good there). I only found out because her partner discovered her conversations with him and sent many screenshots to me.\n\nI lost ALL trust in him at that point. He put it down to us not being well connected at the time (we had a lot of issues in our lives, both separately and as a couple, but we were still together), and just job stress and feeling like he wanted to self-destruct.\n\nSince then I've been very paranoid about him texting other women. He swears he doesn't, but last month I saw that he was texting a female co-worker. He showed me...it wasn't inappropriate but it wasn't necessary...he reached out to her when it had nothing to do with work and sent her a \"xoxo\" which I know means nothing to him but it still pissed me off...I've asked him before to avoid stuff like that and not to engage with women unnecessarily because I saw with my own eyes what happened last time. Now, I KNOW that it seems very controlling for me to not even want him to have female friends, but I don't....not yet. Not if they aren't already established friends. I still am struggling to trust him and I don't need more issues.\n\nNot my finest moment, but I lost my temper. I called him a couple of names (I think....like j\\*\\*k, assh\\*\\*e)...I was just so upset (especially about the xoxo) and in that moment I felt disrespected and like he's not taking it seriously and not even trying to rebuild trust. I walked out of the room and was intending to leave and go for a drive.\n\nHe FREAKED OUT (I guess because I was angry in the first place over something he thinks is stupid, and that I called him names), so he pushed me hard onto the sofa and grabbed an extension cord and whipped me hard on the legs. My legs both ended up with large dark bruises.\n\nI left and went to stay with my cousin. Since then, he's been wonderful. Apologizing, swearing he loves me more than anything, begging me to come back, going to therapy to work on controlling his anger. He now wants to just hang out with me...he's not pressuring me to come back. He asks me to go for dinner, to go have a picnic, to go see a movie. I always say no, but he's begging me to give him another chance to be the partner I need.\n\nWhat do I do?? At this point I can barely even remember exactly what was said that caused him to flip out.

He knows how to talk and lie. I lent him money, which I had to ask for 3 times, and he expected my bf to pay his debt for him. To his credit, he did pay it back, but not without him complaining to my bf in the way of \"why is she asking me for money?\". It was 1/4 of my total money and I need it to start our business. He has money. A few years ago my bf did drywalling for his brothers business which he didn't get paid for. His business was paid for almost in full by his mother. She had to sell her house due to the brothers business venture at a massive loss. Mom is now trying to retire and renting, but bought the brother a large house to live in. He's used to people saying yes to him. I don't trust this guy. At all. \n\nAnyways, I got in an argument with the brother today. He called me greedy because I called him out on what I will now explain. My bf is out of town doing masonry with his bro. His bro told my bf how much he would be making. Which was great pay. But what he didn't tell him is that my bf would be doing the jobs that aren't paid for, or low pay. These small pay jobs need to be done(grouting, labour) so the bro can make 4-6 times the pay by laying bricks without stop. If the bro had to do the small work then he would make far less money. He told Adam he would be doing the same work as him. They would help eachother out. Turns out, that's a lie. (Maury, lol)\nBeing that I'm home, and he's out working in insane heat, I feel like an ass complaining. I can't get over my distrust for my BFs brother and how he is using my bf. Their relationship has always been like this. His bro will explain to my bf that he isn't as good and that's why he gets those jobs. My bf is a good man. I just want him to stand up to his brother.

We started dating at uni/college and are now both living in the city we studied in. We also moved in together around a year ago and have been pretty good together since everything started.\n\nI love sitting down with her to play a game or watch a film. I make her laugh with ease and we genuinely look out for each other. We're both empathetic and good communicators.\n\nShe's great at supporting my pretty relentless focus on my work and probably does more than the fair share of things around the house. I'm lucky to have her and *maybe sure* I love her.\n\n**Problem**\n\nThe **problem** is that she was my first and only relationship / sexual partner.\n\nOver last 12 months or so, I've began to become increasingly occupied by the '**what if**' thoughts.\n\nWhat would others be like?\n\nWhat if I didn't have to spend some much time / mental energy on this person and was free to do other things?\n\n90% of my friends are also hers, meaning 90% of my social experiences also include her. It also means any breakup would have a large negative effect on my circle of friends.\n\nA few times over the last year, she has been away for a few weeks to visit her family. Each time this has happened, I've suddenly felt a little less stressed, a little more sociable and (weirdly?) just sort of younger. *It's almost like I like who I am as a single person more.*\n\n**Her Issues**\n\nMy gf is constantly trying to occupy my time and, even know she supports me and does her best to give me time to work, I find that I can't always just take a few days to do my own thing with others without having to make a strong case for it.\n\nShe also has some self-esteem / mental health issues. She's self harmed in the past (something we eventually managed to replace with her venting to me) and is swept away by anxiety on a weekly basis. I do my absolute best to support her with this. She deserves the support she needs. She's always there for me, all the same.\n\nI can't tell if she's holding me back a bit. Or if I am her. Or if maybe we've become dependant on each other too young.\n\n**My Issues**\n\nHonestly, I can be a bit of a control freak in certain aspects. I hate not controlling my own time and being unproductive. If I have a bad day with work, it comes across pretty clearly.\n\nIn many ways, I need to get my shit together. I don't eat great (something she has tried to fix by cooking most meals). I'm not the tidiest. I can allow my work to distract me from doing things I should.\n\nI'm also the type of person to have a decent number of friends, but never any really great/ close friends. This means my partner ends up being my best friend as well.\n\nI still haven't gotten my head around what's going on with me in terms of my physical attraction to her, but I think I find it a little difficult to find someone with massive insecurity issues physically attractive. She objectively is and I did find her to be for ages, but as more of that insecurity builds, the harder I find it to want her. Which in turn... feeds her insecurity. Mixed, but more of a me issue I think.\n\nI'm simply not as fit or healthy as I was when we got together. She's dealt with that wonderfully.\n\n**The Dilemma**\n\nI'm terrified by the thoughts of what a break up would do to her already rocky mental health.\n\nI don't know if its the right thing for me. Perhaps this is just 'grass is always greener' thinking. There's so much that I love about her, but I can feel something like apathy slowly building all the same.\n\nI don't know how to know if I'm being stupid, selfish or just realistic. The reality is that I'm not going to be young forever and experiences are always passing by.

I don't really know what I'm looking for or if I'm just venting here. I've been in this relationship for nearly 10 years now, NO children. I'm sorry for the word vomit, there's a lot.\n\nMy(30's) SO (30s) doesn't want any responsibility.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, they went on medical leave due to Covid related issues. They refused to go to a doctor until pneumonia set in and almost killed them. They refused to go to the doctor knowing they could not return to work until paperwork was filled out. They refused to go anywhere near a hospital knowing any payments for medical support would be denied unless it had a doctors signature and or other mandatory paperwork confirming they were on medical leave. They plain refused for no other reason then \"it'll work itself out.\" And here we are over a year and a half-later, now with my SO on unemployment because they lost their job because they refused to do this very basic thing citing \"I don't have money\" when they had money. They cite that \"no doctor is available\" when I know that is not true, I work in the medical field. They do the bare minimum to find a job, only filling out what the unemployment office requires. In over a year and a half they have not had a SINGLE job interview. They refuse to get the vaccine.\n\nI have been employed, and going to school this entire time, including through the pandemic. The bills are split 50/50ish, with them contributing 1k of their 1.2k monthly unemployment to cover the rent. I cover food ($450 a month due to three pets) both cars insurance ($125 a month), electric (\\~$200 a month because summer), and phone/internet (at $140 a month). I have very little left over, but my SO has been able to save up nearly 7k??? Probably because any splurging that happens comes out of my pocket.\n\nI feel overwhelmed. I am a person who dislikes people in general and have only two close friends, who both probably would not label me a 'close' friend, but I am fine with that I am very much an introvert and do not like opening up to people. From the moment I wake up every day, my SO follows me room to room, I have no space to myself, I work long shifts. I'm constantly having my shoulders rubbed (ie- I go to use the rest room and SO follows me while I'm just trying to do something as simple as brush my teeth), and I don't know how to tell my SO that I want space without them making it about themselves and how little they \"see me.\" My SO spends every day playing videogames from sun up to sun down, has only the dishes as a chore, and I do everything else. I often come home from work or school to find the animals have not been let outside in hours and the house a mess, and their one chore undone. They often tell me \"just to ask\" them to do something and they will do it. Often I feel as if I'm walking on eggshells because as what happened earlier today, they accused me of stomping around and slamming cupboards after I asked them to do the dishes that had piled up on the counter. They then proceeded to throw their controller on the floor and huff.\n\nI called them a child and to fuck off, and that I didn't want to be a parent to them. That it shouldn't be on me to do everything and to \"remind\" them constantly over such simple things. Even the rent which they pay I make the payments from an account on because, once again, my SO wants no responsibility.\n\nThere is no sex life between us and hasn't been for years due to past trauma as a child on my part and my SO's pushiness. When we were having sex at the start of our relationship, they would always insist on going down on me, and I hate it. Every time they instigate, that's what they want to do and I always turn it down, because as I have verbally told them over and over, I \\*hate\\* it. Atop that, they always insisted on trying to get me off, and I just \\*can't\\* due to past trauma on my end. I cannot make myself be vulnerable to someone else in this way. Supposedly my SO understood this would be off the table when I explained to them the extent of this problem, but instead of being accepting and understanding that sexual time would only be focused on my SO's pleasure which I very much prefer, they approached it as a \"problem to fix.\" This has lead to extreme anxiety on my end, and thus the dead bedroom. I honestly don't know if want sex with anyone, perhaps I am asexual, or perhaps its just the stress of this farce of a relationship killing my sex drive.\n\nAfter our earlier argument my SO stomped out of the house and slammed the door, and didn't say where they were going. They haven't replied to my apology. I'm sure that this isn't worth it anymore, but the last time I tried to breakup, they threatened to take their life.\n\nSo here we are. I don't know what to do. The lease has just been renewed, and I cannot support myself without another person. I am the black sheep of the family and moved states away to be free of them. I apologize if this wasn't coherent.

He is from Italy and we are from Ireland. He moved here shortly before corona hit Italy and ended up staying and working here. We share a house together, 5 bedrooms and occasionally have other people stay for a few weeks. Me and my friend were sharing the house before he moved over and moved in. We've been friends for about four years.\n\nI didn't really like him at the start, i thought he was too arrogant, at times too bad tempered and too possessive over my friend but we lived together fine and him and i have never argued or fallen out. We got on together well once i saw he wasn't just like that and was actually a decent guy.\n\nContext\n\nMy friend has been away for three weeks with work, she goes away fairly regularly but not usually for this long but because the company is expanding she has been stuck with two back to back trips.\n\nMe and him were watching the Euro final together, Italy vs England and drinking and getting too caught up in it and when Italy won we were basically jumping around the living room (i don't even watch football, i just got really into it and his energy with it) and he picked me up and kissed me. Immediately i hit him on the shoulder and told him to put me down and he acted offended telling me it was just a kiss to celebrate. No, you don't lick and suck on someones lip, however briefly, when you kiss them to celebrate.\n\nWe started arguing with each other, shouting and screaming. He was insisting it was just an innocent kiss and i was angry that he was denying it was something more. I'd never argued with someone so intensely before, like my whole body was shaking in frustration at him. He ended up grabbing my arms and telling me that if he was going to kiss me as something more then it would be like this and he just went full force at it. I don't know why but i kissed him back, i think from the mixture of frustration, anger and just the physical outlet of having so much adrenaline. Without going into detail we ended up having sex twice that night.\n\nSituation now\n\nHe has been looking for it to happen again and while he hasn't been pushy he has ramped up the seduction routine 100x.

Throughout the entirety of COVID, my dad refused to see my sister and I. He wasn\u2019t particularly \u201cvulnerable\u201d, but I understood. This was harder for my sister who\u2019d grown used to seeing him more often, as I\u2019d been away at school for 2 years already. My dad wasn\u2019t the most involved parent growing up. I saw him on weekends after my parents divorced and he regularly left us at home so he could go to the club, come back drunk, and get into explosive/violent arguments with his then girlfriend (my current stepmom). He was busy with work during the week and throughout my adolescence, he constantly told me that being the breadwinner (he makes a lot of money) comes at the cost of him spending time with us. I understood him being busy, but it was hard to get a phone call out of him some weeks, and the regular clubbing and alcoholism made me feel like I wasn\u2019t a priority. He also has a bad/quick temper, is prone to cussing and breaking things when mad, and his regular infidelity ultimately broke our family apart. As a result, I grew up not really telling him anything, being secretive, but always being financially dependent on him. I\u2019m still somewhat resentful towards him due to these actions but for the most part I\u2019ve accepted that that\u2019s how he is.\n\nFast forward to today:\n\nI\u2019m back home and he\u2019s made attempts to see us more often after my sister\u2019s mental health came to a breaking point. I was initially fine with visiting every so often, but now that my social life is active, it feels like a burden. I went out with my older brother (his oldest son) for his birthday until 1am (from my dads house) and he essentially lectured me on why I shouldn\u2019t go out with him and told me not to drink. He also texted my brother the whole night and criticized him for inviting me out. When my brother was my age, my dad would invite him out to clubs WITH him regularly. Anytime I want to go out, my dad obsesses over who I\u2019m with, whether I\u2019ll be drinking, whether men will be there, and what time I\u2019ll be back. It makes the entire outing uncomfortable and I feel on edge the entire time, not really able to enjoy myself. There have been many times where I don\u2019t go out at all because I know I\u2019ll be thinking about the lecture I received before and the one I\u2019ll receive after. I also make plans a week in advance expecting to be at my moms house and all of a sudden I\u2019m expected to drop everything to go to his house because my sister wants to go. I don\u2019t have these problems at my moms house. I can go out on weekends, stay over at my boyfriends (who I don\u2019t even feel comfortable telling my dad about because he may spazz), do work in my room (my dad thinks I\u2019m \u201cbeing weird\u201d if I sit in my room and do work alone as opposed to being in a common space), etc. As a whole, I feel like I\u2019m never able to be myself around my dad and I feel like he doesn\u2019t know me at all. I\u2019ve accepted this, but it\u2019s starting to interfere with my social life which I value after being sheltered and kept inside all of high school. I\u2019m financially dependent on my dad, and he won\u2019t allow me to get a normal job (I secretly got one when I was in college because I was thousands of miles away), but I\u2019m not emotionally dependent because he\u2019s never really been there for me in that area or allowed me to express how I feel without being combative. He\u2019s always considered me the \u201cindependent\u201d child, but at heart I think he know\u2019s why. I was in a bigger city than the one I\u2019m currently in for college, and navigated/figured everything out just fine. He didn\u2019t really contact me then. Being financially dependent on him at this point has long term benefits (lack of debt, my car, etc) and so I don\u2019t want to be the person who feels that their social life should outweigh my long-term success because I\u2019m grateful for what he does. I do think I feel resentful of the fact that he spent my childhood picking and choosing when he wanted to be around as a dad but now I\u2019m supposed to change my identity to accommodate that since he has money (he basically got rich when I was a bit older). At this point, I feel like I live a double life. As soon as I graduate, I\u2019ll be getting a job, moving, etc but I feel obligated to keep visiting when my sister does because he pays for stuff. Has anyone had success setting boundaries with an overprotective parent or expressing the desire for more freedom? \n\nTl;dr: My dad picks and chooses when he wants to be in my life, but when he\u2019s \u201cin\u201d he controls a lot of it. I\u2019ve been accepting it because I\u2019m financially dependent and can\u2019t be financially independent under my current circumstances.

He was and still is completely stoic and emotionally detached from my family - the only emotion he showed was explosive rage and anger when my parents fought. Long story short - this is the relationship I've always had with him. I've been scared of him and I love him because now that I'm 30, I understand him - but it's pretty safe to say I've never really had a dad in my life, even if he was technically there.\n\nI know that this has affected my romantic relationships in a huge way. Since I was a teenager, I have pretty much only been attracted to older men (30s, 40s, now 50s). When I was 22, my first boyfriend who I lost my virginity to was 34 years old. I've consistently only dated men who were 5+ years older than me. I've tried seeing other people who were 1-3 years within my age and I just never felt a \"spark.\"\n\nI have been to therapy on and off (off now because of COVID and some other reasons) but I have never felt much healing in this area of my life. I still constantly seek out approval and attention from older men. I do this at work - not in a flirtatious way, but more like I am usually motivated to work or do well based on some male figure (usually managerial, executive level) and wanting to impress him and get his approval, and not really for myself. I've unintentionally chosen a profession that is male-dominated and I always want everyone's approval. And yes, I have been often tempted to flirt with these older male authority figures and it takes me all my energy not to do it, not to fuck up my life, not to ruin relationships. But it's exhausting. I start to \"fall in love\" with these men in a platonic way, but since I can't do anything about it, I just end up feeling more and more sorry for myself and empty and depressed.\n\nSometimes I come home wishing that someone would care about me in a deeply platonic, masculine way, and I know it's impossible, and I just burst into tears crying into a deep depression. I am basically constantly looking for a father figure, and I'm too old for this. It's also something I can't have because there is probably no man out there who wants to randomly act as a father to an adult woman, without any \"benefits\" or eventual romantic pursuit. It just isn't realistic.\n\nSo knowing all this, what can I do for myself? I know it all logically and in my brain, but my heart and soul and spirit keeps searching for something I'll never had.

I did not overreact to this breakup, because it made sense to me, shit wasnt going anywhere.\n\nA month and a half later I find out that she is already with someone new who actually lives nearby her. This really really upset me and triggered that grieving process that I didnt get before, because it was clear that I still loved her.\n\nA month later, skip to now and we are very good friends and talk like every day. She often refers to me as her best friend, didnt believe it at first but she has said it maybe 3 times now. Upon reflection she is also my best friend, I talk to her more on a regular basis than anyone else. She makes me happy to be honest. When I feel down, I will talk to her about whatever and she will make me feel better somehow.\n\nThis is a double edged sword though. We didnt break up all that long ago, and the heartbreak was pretty recent. I still have reserved romantic feelings for her that pop up now and again that make me feel like total shit. Thoughts of someone else being **intimate** with her are what upset me the most. I never even got to touch her skin and I find it really upsetting that some guy just comes along and gets to do stuff to her in a flash.\n\nWhats worse is that even though she knows im not fully over her, im not sure that she takes it seriously enough. She calls me handsome (when the conversation is relevant), and sends me cute pictures of her that have a 50/50 chance of upsetting me. I had a video call with her recently and she was wearing a fuckin nightgown or some shit.

If I'm being dramatic, be gentle about letting me know.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were initially FWB from 2012 to 2015, reconnected in 2017, and dated from July 2018 to September 2019. I had a medical abortion in June 2019 and struggled with guilt and shame in the aftermath. He drove me to and from the clinic for the appointment and follow-up. He was with a friend visiting from out of state when I took the second set of pills for the procedure. I called him that day to tell him I was in pain. When he texted me the day after, he was already out with different friends but agreed to see me later. Two months later, I found a song that helped me cope with it, and he asked me to play it while we were leaving a parking garage because otherwise he'd \"never listen to it,\" and then he made a joke about the title.\n\nFast forward to April/May 2020. I came to terms with my abortion and also accepted a job across the country. So, I told him the news, and we hooked up for about a month until I said we should stop since, at the time, I was supposed to move in July (I did not move and am permanently remote now). He agreed and also told me he'd dated me out of a sense of obligation.\n\nI clearly have Attachment Issues because I reached out to him in March of this year. We've been back together since, and there have been issues. For background, he is friends with two women he had flings with in the past, which I'm not crazy about. He was still pining after one when we started sleeping together in 2017, and although she's dating someone else now, she was a major point of contention in our relationship. I've accepted that his relationships with both of them are strictly platonic.\n\nHe has been friends with another girl for a decade, and I recently learned they had also been FWB. They play computer games together weekly with a third guy present. She lives a few hours away. During COVID lockdowns, he and this girl flirted, she admitted to having a bit of a crush on him, and he told her about my abortion. I felt blindsided by this reveal and furious that he shared such an intimate detail with her but never told me they'd had a sexual relationship. In his defense, this all happened during a global pandemic, and he thought I \"hated his guts.\"\n\nHis best friend is also a girl who dated a guy from 2012 to early 2020. When he and I were sleeping together ahead of my possible move out of state, he learned that she was dating somebody new and was so upset he didn't talk to her for a week. He insists I'm not the consolation prize, but how am I not? On Saturday, I saw a message from this girl on this phone; she made a sexual comment about me and him, prefaced by \"I know we don't normally talk like this...\" It didn't sit right with me. I feel like he would pick her over me in a minute if she were interested.\n\nSince being back together, we've done couples counseling, and the therapist said my boyfriend should cut the three flings out of his life. I asked him not to see the girl he games with until March instead (time to focus on us a couple), but they're still gaming, and my stomach dropped the other night when I saw her name on his phone. \n\nI had told him back in 2019 I loved him, and he said it back a month later because he felt \"obligated\" to. It is 2021, five months together, and I don't love him anymore, and I know he doesn't love me yet. He's started individual therapy, sees me twice a week now after the couples counselor said it, and we talk daily. We took a day trip this past weekend, and he posted a cute picture of us on Instagram. He invited me to dinner with his parents last night. He's incorporated me into his friend group and never says I'm being dramatic for reacting emotionally to the situations above and validates what I feel.\n\nI'm not having luck with switching careers, so I'll admit that's playing a role in feeling insecure about myself in general. But I still feel like our relationship is fragile, like it's just, \"well, good enough.\" We like and respect each other and have chemistry. I feel guilty for wanting to leave, but how am I not the consolation prize? We were sleeping together, and still, he didn't talk to his best friend for a week after he learned she was dating someone else. My friends think I should have left a long time ago, but they also haven't met him because he \"doesn't need new friends.\"\n\nShould I make more of an effort to move forward, or should I call it? If nothing else, I do plan on talking with him tonight more about the best friend.\n\nThis is longer than I thought, so thank you in advance for reading.\n\nThe **TLDR** is that my boyfriend (29M) and I (27F) have a long, complicated history together, made murkier by overlaps in intimacy with other women.

I was an extroverted athlete, so the lockdowns were hell for me.  I have been living with my partner for the last year.  During that time, he (seemingly arbitrarily) started rejecting me for sex more often than not.  We went from basically every day to maybe 1x a week.  Rejection *hurts*, especially when it comes to a person you love rejecting you.  It is also really bad for people like me who need regular, adventurous sex to be happy.  I tried everything I could think of to fix this problem, but he was uninterested in fixing it.  That is where my depression began in earnest\u2014 I felt hideous and unlovable.  What kind of disgusting beast of a woman can't seduce a man who claims to love her?\n\n.\n\nI wound up getting an awful back injury just as the restrictions were loosening up, so I never got to get into my sports that I had missed so much.  I have been in pain every day since march.  That has made my depression worse.\n\n.\n\nYesterday, I finally get MRI results back (my primary care doc did not take my injury seriously, so I had to work around him to even get a referral to a spine specialist, let alone imaging).  My back is far worse off than I thought it was.  I seem to have some kind of degenerative disc disease in addition to all the bulges and herniations I expected to see.  I may not ever get my previous athleticism back.  I may be stuck in this stupid crippled state for the rest of my life.  Reading those results were very hard.  I also found out that a relative of mine has a degenerative lung disease (not COVID) and has maybe 2 years to live.  My relative is a very sweet man and does *not* deserve a death by slow suffocation.  I was horrified by this news.\n\n.\n\nI joined my coworkers for a small gathering to see off somebody that was leaving after all that.  Apparently I made enough self deprecating remarks (which I thought were jovial and in good fun) that I brought everyone down.  I did not notice a change in energy, but my partner said there was one.\n\n.\n\nAfter the gathering, my partner spends a good hour reprimanding me for bringing everybody down all the time.  He tells me that he isn't comfortable being in our shared home because he knows I am going to be sad.  He tells me that he too has stopped feeling optimistic because I bring him down.  He tells me that I cannot speak in any negative way about myself basically ever again.  He tells me that I am choosing to remain sad because \"Pain is inevitable, but we choose to suffer\".  He tells me that if everything is one crisis after another, I need to be doing more to get myself better.  Apparently the intensive therapy I do, the intensive emotional work that I do, and the psychiatric medication I take don't count.  I have often thought that people don't ever actually care about the effort you put into something or your intentions, they only ever care about the result.  This confirms it in my mind.\n\n.\n\nThen, he tells me, \"A partnership should make both people stronger.  I don't feel stronger for being with you.  I just feel exhausted.\"\n\n.\n\nI hadn't heard anything so painful from a man's mouth since my ex husband have me one last good verbal stab on his way out the door.  I am devastated.  \n\n.\n\nIt has become ABUNDANTLY clear that I cannot talk about my depression or even HINT about it in any way whatsoever around any of the people I interact with or care about.  How should I handle this?  How can I pretend to be happy?  I am a sucky liar, so I have just been quiet since everything happened, but that will only work for so long.  I need to be able to convince everybody around me that I am happy.  How???\n\n.\n\nEDIT:  I should have mentioned that I *am* in weekly therapy and I *do* take antidepressants.

He's very proud of his height (he's tall), and he said his type is tall, skinny girls (preferably blonde girls). Guess what I am none of? Those things! I am a 5'1 short petite curvy-ish brunette. I definitely faced insecurities about those parts of myself when I was younger... wanting to be blonde, or 5'10, or whatever... but I've learned to love myself and find myself beautiful, and not that it should matter, but I've found comfort in the fact that other people have found me attractive, too. \n\nBut for some reason that statement really got to me. At the time I told him I didn't need to know that, and I wouldn't tell him my \"type\" (not that I really have one or think in those terms), because it's unnecessary and does nothing for no one. I didn't say this part, but I obviously can't change things like my height, and neither can he, so is there a point in telling each other that we don't meet those dream specifications?\n\nI'm doubly insecure because he's made it pretty clear already that he wants kids one day (I'm not sure about what I want myself), and all I can think about is my dumb short genes letting him down and having kids that are shorter, rather than the basketball team he's probably envisioning. I hate the thought of him thinking these things in his head, and thinking that he might have to \"settle\" with me. \n\nWhat do I do? Do I have to talk about this with him? I feel like if I do, I'll make this a bigger deal than it is. I would prefer to deal with this on my own if possible. It's affecting my confidence in this whole relationship and I'm hoping some kind soul here can snap me out of these crappy thoughts. \n\n**TLDR** New boyfriend said his type is tall skinny blonde chicks. I am short curvy-ish and brunette. Why is he dating me?? Why did he say that?? I'm doubly insecure because he clearly loves being tall, and wants kids someday - all I can think about is how he probably wants a basketball team, and I don't think I can give him that... :(\n\n**Update** I was expecting this to get only a couple comments - thank you everyone for your thoughts, I appreciate them. I do think in most cases, communication is a valuable step before making a decision like \"dump him\". So I'll start there, as some comments suggested.

I am a 26m my gf is a 27f we have been together for 1 year and 5 months and dated 1 year prior to making things official. We just had a son in July. I understand she is going through a lot physically and mentally but it seems like she forgets she now has a family. I do all of the cooking and cleaning to make it easier on her after she has to deal with a baby all day. I am very active in my sons life,  I work 9-5 but once I get off work I take full responsibility of my son , feeding changing, putting him to sleep. My girl will then get him again around 11pm so I can get some sleep for work but I still help out if she needs me Ofcourse. I take care of him fully Friday - Sunday since I\u2019m off so she can rest up. When she is feeling overwhelmed by our son she goes to her moms house for a week so she can have extra help but I still go over after work some days to help out. She recently started goin back out since having our son (she still went out while being pregnant also).  I give her as much freedom as she needs because she couldn\u2019t drink and party due to being pregnant. 3 weeks ago we had my mom watch our son so we can relax. She wanted to go out for her brothers birthday and I asked if I come too and she responded \u201cno I need a break from you and our son\u201d Ofcourse this hurt me a little bit and I was upset and expressed that. I don\u2019t ask to go out with her friends. I wanted to hang with her family since it was a birthday party.  She stayed the night with her family at there hotel.Last week she went out with her friends and said she would be back later that night. She texted me to check on our son and said she would be home later. She didn\u2019t come home til the next day and didn\u2019t notify me at all. I expressed how that wasn\u2019t cool and she should let me know next time. I was very calm during this conversation as I didn\u2019t want to start a fight. Last night she tells me that her sister wants her to spend the night with her this weekend. She said that she found out Wednesday but decided to tell me Thursday night. I was upset because it was so last minute when she told me. She says she loves communication but recently she has been doin that. I told her she needs to tell me things because she has a family now and we have to been on the same page for it to work. It seems like every weekend she wants to spend the night somewhere. I don\u2019t care if she goes out that\u2019s what I expect her to do but I don\u2019t like the fact she spends the night every time she is out and she tells me last minute plans.

Please do not trash on my boyfriend, I genuinely love him and think the world of him but I'm looking for some outside opinions and advice.\n\nI have the sweetest, goofiest boyfriend in the world. We have been together for 2 and a half years and are planning to move in together in December. But I've noticed recently that my boyfriend (27 m) has developed a bit of animosity towards me(24 f). It'll happen randomly. He'll be happy and perfectly fine and will then just randomly develop a sour mood. But only towards me. At first, I thought it was due to stress at work, as he frequently has to work overtime. But as it started to get more frequent, I got more concerned. \n\nI eventually decided to ask him if he was still happy in our relationship, to see where his headspace was at. He said he was, but occasionally said he was not. When I asked him why, he said it was due to situations when we have fought on in the past. They are situations where we have had a fight, made up, and then have modified how we interact with each other. An example being that I used to make a lot of sarcastic jokes towards him, as I do with a lot of my friends. They hurt his feelings and he told me he didn't like them so I stopped doing them after he told me about it. \n\nI asked him if he thought that I did not change at all and he told me that I absolutely did, but when the thoughts come up in his mind that these things happened in the past and he remembers them, he gets angry at me again. And that is why he was been getting more sour towards me and and having more animosity. I told him that I didn't think that was fair to me, as if we already have resolved a disagreement and things aren't happening the same way again then he shouldn't hold resentment towards me. He agreed, but said he felt like he didn't get to be angry at the time and that's why he still gets resentful about our previous fights. To which I told him that I 100% support him being firm and standing up for himself when we having a disagreement and that I do not want him to suppress himself and make him be docile because I want to have a relationship where both people are happy, not a relationship where one person feels shut out.\n\nWhat can we both do the get past this and eliminate any sort of animosity and resentment he still has? I'm not sure how to deal with this to be honest, is there anything I can do at all? It's confusing because he said that I'm not doing anything wrong at all.

So here it is,how can you know if a person is genuine/real in a long distance relationship setup? \n\nMy partner (20sM) and I (20sF) have been dating for a year now and I've never been so happy after my last relationship. He's the exact opposite of my ex and always wants to fight for me. He's sweet, thoughtful, loving, caring but as every relationship there is there are flaws too. Now that he's moving to another place for (military), he made some plans for us after the training. We originally planned to meet each other but because of pandemic, we can't do it. Before he was so enthusiastic in telling me he's excited to see me when my country's borders reopen again. Last night, while he was talking about being excited in joining the army (few weeks from now), he mentioned he's going to tell it to a friend of his so that they could catch up along with his other friends too. And I said that its nice but was confused because originally, he said before he doesn't want to tell them because he doesn't think they'll even care that he'll be gone. But now he ready to drop the news since he hopes they'll come down to visit him when his graduation comes. So I asked him who are the people he expects to come on his grad day and he said he's family ofc and friends. Then I asked him again and told me the same thing. I was deeply sad because he didn't include me and I asked him why. He said that due to my country's situation, he knows it'll be hard for me to come down too. That ripped my heart because I was very happy with him being positive about us meeting up despite of pandemic. It showed me how he really cares about our relationship but then I was hurt that he backed off from his words and became pessimist about it. He's truly convinced that I will not make it and he said he doesn't want to be hurt by expecting. I told him that he's reason hurt me although I understand where he's coming from but anything can happen, there's a lot of possibilities but to him, he shot down the chance even if it didn't started yet. I replied that even if we don't like the situation, I'm still hopeful and have been working my ass off just to save up (one of the reasons why he joined the army so he can pay for my ticket then I'll pay it back) so I can see him but then I felt like I was been bailed off with our original plan. I added that my hard work just doesn't make sense anymore since he didn't believe in me/us and felt like he just dismissed my efforts. I told him I don't want to waste his time anymore if that's how his way of thinking is now. Then he apologized for not believing then we made up but I'm still butt hurt about it. I asked him what's his plan if in case even after we did our best, we can't still meet up. He said that he's going to come down in my place next year. I said okay but I didn't really fully absorbed this time as I was hurt. Now because of what happened I'm left here thinking if he's still serious about me/us. Idk if I should believe him or not. There's this thought in me where I can't get rid of, that joining the army he's about to explore the world and I'm afraid I'm not included. The days he spent with me are just a form of validation and for me being an enotional crutch (being supportive). So any ldr couples out there who wants to share their opinions/advices?

I'm also going to post a few other places so apologies if you see it more than once.\n\nTldr - I \\[32M\\] asked my ex \\[48M\\] not to contact me after I broke up with him, but he's been finding loopholes and this week he \"bumped into\" me which I don't think was a coincidence. I asked him again not to contact me and he sent me a very disturbing email which has made me really anxious. I'm not worried about my physical safety but I feel really gross and I'm scared he's going to keep doing this. Is there anything I can do?\n\nI've posted before about this but the situation has changed since. I recently ended a relationship that was v unhealthy for me (still can't figure out if it counts as \"abuse\" or not, basically he admitted that he got off on thinking about my past abuse and pushed me into situations where I was basically forced to reenact it).\n\nI very clearly asked him not to contact me again. He *kinda* stuck to that until very recently, but he did seem to be looking for loopholes (e.g. he contacted one of my friends to tell them he was \"concerned\" about me, I've recently been made aware that he may have been making posts online - not to me but about me, and it's anonymous so I can't prove it).\n\nI'm now worried that he might be escalating. Earlier this week, I \"bumped into\" him on my way home from work. Realistically I can't think of any good reason he would have been in that area at that time but obviously I can't prove it wasn't a coincidence. He tried to push me into going for a drink with him so he could \"apologise\", and he was only willing to let me leave when I agreed to think about it. The way he spoke and acted was very unsettling but it wasn't overtly threatening or anything. I got some advice and ended up texting him yesterday saying I didn't want to meet him, asking again for no contact, and blocking him again.\n\nAt like 3am this morning, I got a long-ass creepy-ass email from an address I didn't recognise. Obviously it was him. It was like over 2000 words and he sounded f\\*\\*king unhinged. Also included a few photos I def didn't want to see. It wasn't aggressive or threatening as such, it was more obsessive and really f\\*\\*king graphic and disturbing in places, I still feel shaken up and kinda sick. Luckily I didn't get it until I got up this morning and there was people I could call, if I read it at the time he sent it, it would have sketched me out completely. I assume he was coked up or something when he wrote it, it really didn't sound normal.\n\nI'm very worried because he seems to be pushing more, he knows where I live and work, and obvs there's nothing stopping him making new email accounts etc. However, I don't know if he's actually committed a crime. I feel physically safe rn, my current bf is being amazing and he's helped lots with thinking about practical safety issues. Even my boss has been good (which is saying something, he's usually a massive d\\*\\*khead - I'm guessing hes remembering the time I had to come in to work with handprints round my neck) so I don't have to work this weekend.\n\nObvs I kept the email even though I desperately wanted to delete that shit immediately. I'm wondering about going to the police, but tbh I am VERY wary of them and also have very little faith that they'll actually do something useful. I don't even know if he's committed a crime, some of the stuff in his email was really f\\*\\*ked up but I don't know if it's illegal. He's also a lot more respectable than me on paper, and tbh the police haven't exactly overwhelmed me with support when I've been victimised previously.\n\n(I know I probably seem really stupid for getting in this mess in the first place and for being so clueless about sorting it. My upbringing was really messed up and there are a lot of life skills that seem obvious to other people that are really difficult for me).\n\nDoes anyone know if there's anything I can do?

The relationship didn't start really well as she didn't feel sexual chemistry between the two of us.\n\nAfter a while, we started to find some. I was really happy with our sexual dimension, but i felt she was not really happy, as she didn't receive all the pleasure she had before. She said no, it's not true. \n\nShe also mentionned undirectly about my body or her sexual preferences (penis size, body type) or the way I was making love. She said she had no troubles with it, ans she was fine with it. And she complained a lot I was talking about penis size or balls size, or the rest. \n\nIn march, we were talking about sex, and she said the sex lover she has before me gave the most pleasure she never received. And i said \"more than me\" and she said yes. In May she confessed she liked well endowed men, my balls were small, true, and that was the way she was thinking at the beginning of the relationship.\n\nAlso she said she was confident in our way to make love, \"it will evolve\". She also said she likes dom act by her lover, but I'm not like this.\n\nAlso she said nobody could touch her breast like I did. But once she said one man gave her an orgasm with her breast (which I never have). I was really surprised. \n\nShe was really anxious at the beginning. I was not in her criteria, but i treated her well and kindly.\n\nNow the relationship is stronger, for me I don't feel confident while having sex. But now she said she never had such a good sex, she is completely changed her way to do sex, as she changed in the relationship. All her sex lover look faded compare to me. But we haven't changed anything. As I'm hurt, things are mess good for me. \n\nTo be honest, I don't believe her at all. She asks me to let it go while having sex, but i feel really self conscious, sometimes I think she is faking (but i know it is not true), I don't believe her when I am sexy, because that was not the case by the beginning. She says everything is perfect, but she is always asking me to do stuff like this or this... \n\nAt the beginning I believed my guts and i was right. This is what I'm telling her. I prefer to believe my guts than to believe her, because she said so much different things.\n\nThe problem is now it is affecting her as well, and she is angry vs me. I tell her I prefer to be honest. She says don't look in the past in the present. But that doesn't work like this.\n\nSo now I'm stuck. I'm really selfconscious when having sex and i don't believe her. \n\nTo finish, I don't care about all of this. I just want to feel confident and relax. That's all. She tries to reassure me, but she doesn't know how to do. She says I'm harsh with her. And i feel miserable. \n\nTl;dr: I don't believe my gf as she said opposite things.

Last night he went through my Twitter and saw that I had replied to the private account of a male and immediately lost it. I sent him screenshots of everything to explain. My male friend of 10 years had tweeted about his girlfriend and how they\u2019ve been in quarantine together for 13 months and she has now moved on to making Borat sounds/references. I replied with \u201cvery nice, yes?\u201d as a playful remark and another one of our girl friends joined in on the clowning action. That was the extent of it. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m now being told that I\u2019m behaving like I\u2019m single on social media and being accused of talking to that friend \u201chella\u201d.\n\nThis friend and I belong to a group of two other guys and two other girls and only three of us are still on Twitter and we occasionally clown on each other. I told my bf (of 5 months) that the group sees each other maybeeeee once a year and we all bring our significant others to meet, have a good time and then go back to our lives since we\u2019re all busy and living in different places. Otherwise we don\u2019t really talk much outside of the birthday wishes and occasional remarks on social media. \n\nHe went on to also start pulling up random guys I follow and have been following since before I met my bf and accusing me of newly following them and talking to them/ adding them on snap and ig as well. I explained to him, as I have many times before, that the lists aren\u2019t in order for him and that he\u2019s mistaken. I again sent screenshots to prove that I haven\u2019t even followed anyone new on twitter since following him 5 months ago. \n\nHe saw me receive two snaps yesterday from guys, which I opened in front of him. One was a snake and the other was a billboard. He went on to accuse me of recently adding one of them even though I\u2019ve known that person for year and a half. He thinks just because I haven\u2019t explicitly spoken to him about every single friend or he hasn\u2019t seen their name before, then everyone\u2019s a new add and I\u2019m messing around. Any time I bring up anyone, his response is \u201coh yeah, you just recently followed them\u201d. This has been about everyone, girls, family, guys. I don\u2019t know how to make him understand that what he sees isn\u2019t accurate. I constantly provide proof of who I\u2019ve followed and interacted with. \n\nOne of his issues, that I understand, is that I haven\u2019t posted him yet. Which I\u2019ve explained that I will when I\u2019m comfortable and know we\u2019re on more solid ground. I was just getting to the point of wanting to post him. He\u2019s accusing me of hiding him and acting single on my socials. Which is hilarious because I hardly post anything, if at all. And none of it is about me, or of me or single behavior. My accounts are private, I haven\u2019t been adding new people and I keep to myself. \n\n\nSo after going back and forth, he\u2019s sticking to me being very social and active, because I simply MUST be talking frequently to one friend I tweet replied to. He again brought up that I\u2019m adding new guys on everything and talking to them. He gets into his thoughts and starts making up scenarios and now suddenly I\u2019m adding and talking to everyone, acting single on my socials and hiding him for that reason. It\u2019s so exhausting having to deal with this on a nearly weekly basis. I\u2019ve pointed out that his behavior (constantly being at my neck about what I\u2019m doing) is starting to become suspicious because why is it so hard for him to believe that I\u2019m not doing stuff behind his back unless that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. I have dropped so many friends and kept other interactions with friends (males) to a minimum, to make him comfortable and he still thinks it\u2019s not enough. I also was very clear from the get go that there will be guys who I am not getting rid of and that I expect him to meet them. The friend I replied to and that group o belong to, being prime examples. \n\nHe also implied at the end of his latest rant that I\u2019m a slur that I can\u2019t use on here. And that I should be single if I want to act like I\u2019m single. All this because I spoke to a friend about his gf lmao. In the past I\u2019ve explained that he can\u2019t try to make me sound like a whore every time he\u2019s upset or that he can\u2019t laugh at/bully me and call me a joke because I\u2019m not giving him the reaction he needs. I usually try to just stop talking to him when he\u2019s in those moods because he\u2019ll calm down and come back to it. But I have no way of getting him to snap out of it in the moment and his behavior doesn\u2019t seem to be changing. \n\nWe have a lot of the same conversations over and over again, and he tends to rewrite what I\u2019ve said in his head. Even when I get him to *finally* understand me, if it comes up again later, he\u2019ll go right back to his initial thoughts and comments. He calls me a liar a lot, which is comical considering how open I am and how much proof I provide him with to make him feel better or reassure him. He\u2019s called me a liar this whole day too. \n\n\nWriting all this makes me feel stupid because it\u2019s very obvious that his behavior is abusive. I\u2019ve already been in both a physically abusive and emotionally/mentally abusive relationships where they treated me similarly and were even more controlling. I made it super clear going into this, what I\u2019d been through and what I wasn\u2019t willing to put up with again. Some how I\u2019ve managed to come back to the same place. \n\nI will say that he hasn\u2019t had a relationship before me. And he has made progress in other areas that we\u2019ve had issues in. But when he gets angry, he just kind of snaps and doesn\u2019t really pay attention to what he\u2019s saying or how he\u2019s speaking to me - the woman he \u201cloves\u201d. We both have our flaws and insecurities and I have room to grow too. I\u2019m trying to be understanding, but how much is too much? Is there anything left to salvage? Am I just not allowed to speak to the opposite sex, ever again? \n\n\nTl;DR my boyfriend has a lot of temper tantrums and irrational thoughts. He doesn\u2019t have prior relationship experience, has made a lot of progress and is usually open to criticism. But in this specific area, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an positive changes, only a continued cycle of the same behavior.

I feel a lot of obligation to \"walking on eggshells\" around him because my childhood was structured around not making him angry. he's SO much better now that I've finally started opening up about my self harm habits (4 years clean!!) and how his behavior plays into my mental state so much.

And it\u2019s time I move on from this chapter in my life. It isn\u2019t as easy as walking away either. Because we are used to going long periods without speaking due to being busy etc. And then just picking right up where we left off. There\u2019s no way around talking about it, since it\u2019s in the way of me being her friend, and me being able to form other deeper relationships. Sometimes when we are hanging out I just go quiet and almost can\u2019t even look at her because of how bad I want to tell her. Is there another way to get closure on this? If there\u2019s another way I\u2019m happy to hear it. But the thing is I feel like I at least want to put it out there. Because she really is my dream girl. And I trust her more than anyone. \n\nThe reason I haven\u2019t told her before has been a lot of reasons. More than I care to list really. Constantly talking about how we were best friends, staring at me, getting quiet and passive when I showed her girls I was talking to. Eventually straight up asking to see my wiener. And also getting possessive when I was thinking about getting into an adult line of work. Around this same time was when we got distant again after her telling me she would be ok without me. All of these reasons and more were originally why I thought she could never be into me and we were always friends. But I\u2019m starting to get the idea maybe they were signs she was into me and I fucked up. I had a very long hard struggle with mental health so my sense of self worth was lost in the abyss somewhere. And I was pretty deep into depression. Once I clawed my way out of it and began to feel desirable and make friends and become healthy mentally did it all click. And I realized so much about how special our relationship actually was. Because we are still friends but I miss her. Especially how close we were. We would talk every day about everything for hours. \n \nNow I would have told her when I manned up two years ago. But she was already dating someone. And then they ended up getting married quickly after they started dating. She told me that he reminded her of me a lot. Our friendship was a big point of contention for him. He was very uncomfortable with me and as a result we haven\u2019t talked much if at all since they\u2019ve gotten married. Even after they moved to the same town as me we\u2019ve only hung out 2 or 3 times in the last year. It\u2019s been rocky and they\u2019ve separated and got back together 3 times already. He doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me and I\u2019ve tried including him in plans before and extending olive branches but he doesn\u2019t care. So I\u2019ve just been respecting their space. \n\nBesides being worried about the obvious fact that she\u2019s married, I\u2019m worried because she has told me she\u2019s felt sick or almost betrayed when her male friends admit to having feelings for her. But it\u2019s also important that I be able to express it as it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working on in therapy. And we\u2019ve been friends for 12+ years now. So I feel like we\u2019d be able to get through it gracefully for better or for worse right? I don\u2019t feel like waiting around anymore. \n\nThe state of things is that they are currently separated/talking divorce but also seeing a therapist every two weeks. Am I getting the timing all wrong? I feel like it would be the most fair to do it now since it would confirm her husbands suspicions and maybe give him validation and make it more fair. (I have tried to confess before but never really nailed it down through a letter that she still keeps. He saw it and immediately said I had feelings for her and I\u2019ve been denying it since. I\u2019ve never crossed any boundaries with her though even before they were married.) But I also don\u2019t want to just wait until they\u2019re officially divorced and she\u2019s over him because I know her, and it would be YEARS. And I would like to find my own someone if she isn\u2019t then one in that time. \n\nThis all just feels way more complicated than what I\u2019m able to deal with. And I don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to in person about this so here I am. What should I do? I\u2019m not even sure if I got all the details! It\u2019s been something that\u2019s been years in the making. \n\nTLDR; I have feelings for my long time best friend that I want to move past.

(It\u2019s evening now, so just under a full day) after spending some time with me and dropping me back off at home, he decided to go home and start lurking through my social media, which is a regular thing for him and I\u2019ve come to accept that he checks on things. I check on things too, though not as frequently or as thoroughly, so I don\u2019t have the biggest issue with it. Last night he went through my Twitter and saw that I had replied to the private account of a male and immediately lost it. I sent him screenshots of everything to explain. My male friend of 10 years had tweeted about his girlfriend and how they\u2019ve been in quarantine together for 13 months and she has now moved on to making Borat sounds/references. I replied with \u201cvery nice, yes?\u201d as a playful remark and another one of our girl friends joined in on the clowning action. That was the extent of it. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m now being told that I\u2019m behaving like I\u2019m single on social media and being accused of talking to that friend \u201chella\u201d.\n\nThis friend and I belong to a group of two other guys and two other girls and only three of us are still on Twitter and we occasionally clown on each other. I told my bf (of 5 months) that the group sees each other maybeeeee once a year and we all bring our significant others to meet, have a good time and then go back to our lives since we\u2019re all busy and living in different places. Otherwise we don\u2019t really talk much outside of the birthday wishes and occasional remarks on social media. \n\nHe went on to also start pulling up random guys I follow and have been following since before I met my bf and accusing me of newly following them and talking to them/ adding them on snap and ig as well. I explained to him, as I have many times before, that the lists aren\u2019t in order for him and that he\u2019s mistaken. I again sent screenshots to prove that I haven\u2019t even followed anyone new on twitter since following him 5 months ago. \n\nHe saw me receive two snaps yesterday from guys, which I opened in front of him. One was a snake and the other was a billboard. He went on to accuse me of recently adding one of them even though I\u2019ve known that person for year and a half. He thinks just because I haven\u2019t explicitly spoken to him about every single friend or he hasn\u2019t seen their name before, then everyone\u2019s a new add and I\u2019m messing around. Any time I bring up anyone, he\u2019s response is \u201coh yeah, you just recently followed them\u201d. This has been about everyone, girls, family, guys. I don\u2019t know how to make him understand that what he sees isn\u2019t accurate. I constantly provide proof of who I\u2019ve followed and interacted with. \n\nOne of his issues, that I understand, is that I haven\u2019t posted him yet. Which I\u2019ve explained that I will when I\u2019m comfortable and know we\u2019re on more solid ground. I was just getting to the point of wanting to post him. He\u2019s accusing me of hiding him and acting single on my socials. Which is hilarious because I hardly post anything, if at all. And none of it is about me, or of me or single behavior. My accounts are private, I haven\u2019t been adding new people and I keep to myself. \n\n\nSo after going back and forth, he\u2019s sticking to me being very social and active, because I simply MUST be talking frequently to one friend I tweet replied to. He again brought up that I\u2019m adding new guys on everything and talking to them. He gets into his thoughts and starts making up scenarios and now suddenly I\u2019m adding and talking to everyone, acting single on my socials and hiding him for that reason. It\u2019s so exhausting having to deal with this on a nearly weekly basis. I\u2019ve pointed out that his behavior (constantly being at my neck about what I\u2019m doing) is starting to become suspicious because why is it so hard for him to believe that I\u2019m not doing stuff behind his back unless that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. I have dropped so many friends and kept other interactions with friends (males) to a minimum, to make him comfortable and he still thinks it\u2019s not enough. I also was very clear from the get go that there will be guys who I am not getting rid of and that I expect him to meet them. The friend I replied to and that group o belong to, being prime examples. \n\nHe also implied at the end of his latest rant that I\u2019m a whore. And that I should be single if I want to act like I\u2019m single. All this because I spoke to a friend about his gf lmao. In the past I\u2019ve explained that he can\u2019t try to make me sound like a whore every time he\u2019s upset or that he can\u2019t laugh at/bully me and call me a joke because I\u2019m not giving him the reaction he needs. I usually try to just stop talking to him when he\u2019s in those moods because he\u2019ll calm down and come back to it. But I have no way of getting him to snap out of it in the moment and his behavior doesn\u2019t seem to be changing. \n\nWe have a lot of the same conversations over and over again, and he tends to rewrite what I\u2019ve said in his head. Even when I get him to *finally* understand me, if it comes up again later, he\u2019ll go right back to his initial thoughts and comments. He calls me a liar a lot, which is comical considering how open I am and how much proof I provide him with to make him feel better or reassure him. He\u2019s called me a liar this whole day too. \n\n\nWriting all this makes me feel stupid because it\u2019s very obvious that his behavior is abusive. I\u2019ve already been in both a physically abusive and emotionally/mentally abusive relationships where they treated me similarly and were even more controlling. I made it super clear going into this, what I\u2019d been through and what I wasn\u2019t willing to put up with again. Some how I\u2019ve managed to come back to the same place. \n\nI will say that he hasn\u2019t had a relationship before me. And he has made progress in other areas that we\u2019ve had issues in. But when he gets angry, he just kind of snaps and doesn\u2019t really pay attention to what he\u2019s saying or how he\u2019s speaking to me - the woman he \u201cloves\u201d. We both have our flaws and insecurities and I have room to grow too. I\u2019m trying to be understanding, but how much is too much.\n\n\nTl;DR my boyfriend has a lot of temper tantrums and irrational thoughts.

The building is accessed by a single door on the ground floor and a stairwell leads up to ours and our neighbour's flat doors. Only our two households share the ground floor door, and the flat doors can be locked. Our door is white with a frosted window, and our neighbour's is solid and dark brown, so not easily mixed up.\n\nOur neighbours recently moved in a few weeks ago and we've had very little interaction with them. We're not even sure how many people are living there. But from what we've heard, since moving in they have regularly had multiple guests over and occasionally throw parties.\n\nFast forward to tonight, and our neighbours had guests. My partner was downstairs in the kitchen (which is near our flat door, which was not locked at the time) and I was upstairs on my computer with my headphones on. Suddenly a completely strange man just opens the door and steps in. My partner saw him as he entered, and immediately yelled at him to leave. He mumbled an apology and left. Having heard a commotion, I came downstairs a moment later to find my partner a little shaken up (especially as she didn't notice him coming up the stairwell, which echoes loudly).\n\nWere quite sure he was there to see the neighbours, and that they had probably left the downstairs door off latch for him to get into the building. Normally we wouldn't mind if someone just got the wrong flat, but the fact that he just waltzed in without knocking has us concerned.

But I don't know if this is acceptable with my sexual feelings?\n\nMy friend: We've known each other for a few years. Started as a fling on Bumble, tried dating, went to FWB and finally just became friends. Over our years of friendship we've filled the \"partner role\" as we've helped each other move, took care of each others pets, even ended up moving to the same state across country. All of this being said, we have no romantic chemistry on either side. We're kind of like David and Stevie in Schitt's Creek - too similar to ever work in a romantic capacity but work amazingly as friends (and up until a year ago, on and off as FWBs). He's super respectful of my relationship and would never make a move while I'm involved. We see each other at least once per week for a coffee or a walk. He's met my boyfriend and they get along really well.\n\nMy boyfriend: dating 6 months. Going fantastically, an amazing guy and knows about the friend and the history. He's so intelligent, supportive, and the kindest person I've ever met. Unfortunately, he's also insanely depressed recently. Self harm, barely making it through work, like really really badly depressed. We haven't had sex in a couple months and barely see each other. He's slowly getting better (therapy and drugs - he's honestly being so independent and active to try and help himself). It's been tough, but manageable and he's still the same kind guy even at his worst which is so admirable. He's trying to support me as best as he can too and we still text daily, though most of our dates are two hours and it's a really good day if he's feeling up to even making out (but he still gives me compliments and tries to show up in little ways). While the sex is gone, there's still so much love and effort and I have no doubt that things will go back to a bit more normal once his meds fully kick in and he's applying the therapy more consistently. \n\nSince my boyfriend has been pretty MIA I've been spending a bit time with my friend. It's been good, totally platonic as usual and we've always been close, but I'm definitely having some more sexual feelings recently. No intention of acting on them, and as above he's really supportive of my relationship and is a super moral guy - he'd never go for it while I was in a relationship. But, I know he's had a hard time during the pandemic as he's been single, and I know that if we were both single we'd probably be hooking up again.\n\nI feel really bad though because this sexual energy should be directed towards my boyfriend (and I am being active about this - I have some photos of him and memories to use)! But I remember how easy things were with my friend and I miss sex. (Note: due to depression, while sex has always been great with my boyfriend it hasn't necessarily been easy due to some body image stuff on his end - that being said the guy is an Adonis and I feel like over the long term, with trust and less focus on PiV it will settle, but at the time we'd really only been having sex for 3 months when the depression hit.)\n\nI'm redirecting these feelings as much as possible. My boyfriend is really someone who can be a partner in life. The sex is fantastic when he does have drive (and he's slowly getting it back!), and we have so much joy and silliness in humor. So, in all of this, is it possible to keep my friendship or am I putting my relationship at risk?\n\nTL;DR: Relatively new boyfriend is depressed, haven't had sex in a couple months, I've had sexual feelings for a close friend/old FWB and am not sure if the friendship is inappropriate as long as we keep the status quo (keep it in public, keep it platonic, don't dwell on the sexual thoughts)?", "title": "I [f/29] am dealing with sexual feelings for a friend [m/30] while my boyfriend is depressed [m/29], help?"}, {"created_utc": 1619998584, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n3iv2m/19f_im_starting_to_get_fat_shamed_by_my_bf_21m/", "num_comments": 359, "score": 1, "selftext": "*A bit of background info* I\u2019m Asian and my family is  very conservative and old fashioned, I\u2019ve been working at a fast food place for 3 years and I adopted bad eating habits, I gained a ton of weight, unfortunately I went from normal-ish weight to morbidly obese, my parents love to ridicule my weight and they think shaming me will make me want to change my eating habits but in reality it just makes me want to never be around them.  \n\nI met my boyfriend about 5 months ago through a mutual friend on Snapchat, we would video chat and call daily, I became REALLY attached to him, one of the things I loved about him was how he tried to make me feel better when I would go through hard times with my family, he was basically my vent outlet.

She left me because she was unhappy and we had recently went in a period of arguing frequently about petty issues. We decided to keep things civil between us and she said that she wants us to stay in contact and keep each other updated on things in our lives as she still loves me so for the first couple weeks after the breakup we spoke every other day almost but we began to stop speaking eventually. I would like to preface this by saying I still love her and I would do anything to have her back; We do not live together so I have not seen her in person since the breakup and when I did see her it was on social media when she was with her friends and although I was glad to see her happy again because that is what\u2019s most important to me I felt jealous and almost anger that she was seemingly so contempt with being alone and that she can just move on in a fortnight, whereas I have been completely devastated and an emotional wreck since we split. One night she was out with her friends and I had saw it on her story and I was truly angry, this was where I snapped, I hated the idea that I could allow myself to be angry because she was happy without me and I tried to move on but I couldn\u2019t I just couldn\u2019t.  \n\nAfter 3 weeks of being separated one night I was drinking alone in my house (around 4 AM)and I caved after not speaking to her for over a week I sent a series of messages and voicemails to her. I essentially told her how sorry I was for ruining what we had and for taking her for granted cause she\u2019s the best thing to ever happen to me (which is true) and I told her I would make her happy again like she used to be and I begged for another chance and asked if we could meet to talk. She said no she said I hadn\u2019t given her enough time to think and that she can\u2019t go through being unhappy again no matter if I promise her she will be happy and she reminded me that she does still love me. I then apologised and said I understand. The truth is I do not understand how if she loves me she can still be without me because to me love conquers all and even I in the past had doubts about our relationship or had moments of unhappiness but I worked through it and gave the relationship a chance because I love her. That puts me in a confusing situation either she loves me and wants to get back together or she doesn\u2019t love me anymore which is why she wants to stay separated but then I don\u2019t get why she would constantly reassure me that she still loves me. Anyway we did not speak after that until 3 days ago when she messaged me to tell me a story about work (not something for advice just a funny story) we spoke for a few hours just about life and how we were doing and that waste next at without thinking I messaged her again asking to meet up but this time all I said was I have some stuff to say, she agreed and we arranged to meet tomorrow for food.\n\nI have no idea what I\u2019m going to say to her or what she expects from me whether that be asking for her back or telling her I\u2019ve came to terms with being separated or just something that\u2019s happened in my life that I feel she should know, and yes I know I\u2019m stupid for not working this out before I asked her to meet but I thought I knew what I was going to do, I thought I would just profess my love to her and how I can make her so happy again and she would say she wants that too but now I realise I was naive and I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. I still love her and I want her to be happy and I thought I could accept that her happiness means life without each other but I can\u2019t and i know that sounds horrible and uncaring but I just want her to be happy with me if that makes sense. \n\nWhat i want to know is what should I do, should I just accept what\u2019s happened and tell her I\u2019ve moved on, or should I try and get her to come back to me (because she says she still loves me so is there a chance) or should I do something completely different I truly have no idea. I miss her so much and nothing in my life has ever meant as much or been as important to me as her and I do want her back.\n\nSo to all the people out there that have been in my position and got their partner back how did you do it and did it work out, were they happy again? \nTo those who were or are in niamhs position what would you want your partner to do and what should I do or not do?\nAnd to any relationship experts out there am I wrong for pursuing her if she told me she was unhappy towards the end of our relationship?\nHonestly I just want help I\u2019m completely lost and have no one to turn to\n\nThank you\n\n\nTL:DR tomorrow I am meeting up with my girlfriend who left me because she was unhappy but she says she still loves me, it\u2019s been 5ish weeks since we broke up.

We started texting on-and-off, one night we had an intense conversation via text &amp; voice messages and realized we have good chemistry. The frequency &amp; intensity hasn't changed and at one point when I called her she told me I'm totally her type, so I asked her out on a date.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe date we had was great! She was a bit afraid of meeting up since we were seeing each other for the first time, but her anxiety quickly wore off and we had an amazing afternoon. We already made loose plans for a second date in early October since she is busy until then. After the date, we still texted normally for two days. However here comes the point where I think I fucked up.\n\nFor background information: She is bisexual and frequently made jokes about abandoning dating men at some point due to bad experiences. However she also genuinely complimented me on being polite and actually giving her the feeling that I respect her and not just trying to get her to sleep with me. At some point when we got to know each other we also talked about what we are like in bed and found out we would be very compatible.  Also I am slightly autistic, which might be a factor on the following situation. I have a hard time judging on how inappropiate the joke I made might be, to be honest.\n\nWe were talking about how it's unfair that she gets in trouble at school for the way she dresses. She dresses very punk/goth, sometimes a bit revealing, so the teachers told her to dress differently to \"protect her from boys making inappropriate comments\". I agreed with her that it's logical that she shouldn't be the one in trouble in that situation, etc. She sent me a voice message which was completely silent (technical error) and when she responded to me pointing that out she said she forgot what exactly the message contained. I responded by saying \"Well, then I can just make up something in my head what you might have said and go with that\" She said \"Sure, have fun, when I wake up I want to hear the best version ;)\" She went to bed and I made a voice message where I was jokingly like \"Yea, first you complained about how the boys at your school are so immature, yada yada, and then you were like 'Oh but (my name), you are so different!! You are the only reason why I still date men!! But you are kinda weird, so I would only trust you during sex when you are tied up'\"\n\nI followed up with a \"response\" to that obviously made up bullshit by saying \"Yea sure, I might be weird and hard to read sometimes, maybe you have to get to know me better - but we can arrange that\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really didn't think much of it, to me it was a light hearted joke only containing stuff we already talked about. She responded by saying \"Yea, I think I am lesbian now. And I agree, you are kinda weird.\" \n\nI just said she got what she asked for when challenging me to generate random stuff coming out of my mouth &amp; that being weird just means I like her, otherwise I would try to come off as normal as possible. Since then, for the last 3-4 days she took a long time to respond, leaves me on read &amp; her responses have become simple, the conversation is just not flowing any more. Advice I got from my peers only contains the message \"Yea, just leave her alone, she will come back if she is interested\" Which I think to be true, I haven't yet made the mistake of spamming her with texts or to do anything to seem needy/desperate. However I have the feeling the joke might have offended her or at least reduced the attraction she feels towards me. Maybe the reason is something completely different and I am just interpreting too much in her behaviour.

We were getting along well, so I thought. We only dated for 4 months. It was the best 4 months I had for a couple year. I struggle with depression, PTSD and I'm also Bipolar. Although I feel more autistic than bipolar. He made everything slightly more manageable in life. Him being around gave me motivation to eat properly (hard cooking a whole meal for just yourself), him being around helped me watch TV (cant watch it by myself, it makes me sleepy within 20mins), Him being around made me want to be the best we could be (adulting, building an empire). Our only real issues were, we hardly had sex nd his addiction problem. Hes been clean for four months - basically when he left the hospital and started hanging with me. He did relapse a couple times which hurt me but I forgave him within a day or so. I understood from the beginning of our relationship a relapse will happen every so often.\n\nMonday morning, I woke up in a very bad mood. PMS and being horny as fuck. I tried to turn him on by being big spoon and reaching over to fondle him BUT his dick was tucked. His dick as always tucked whenever I tried to make the mooooves. So anyways I woke up in the worse mood and told him we needed to have sex more. Once a week wasn't enough for me. I told him if we didn't start fucking more he will need to start trying to find another place to live. We didnt say much more after that. I got ready for work and during work we texted about it. I thought we were talking it out to figure it out. He stated he talked to his friend about what i said and his friend say \"sounds like yall just need to fuck and get over it.\".... So I thought ayye he's right. Communication than stopped. I Left work to go home cook us a steak dinner and cuddle up watching Netflix, but he was gone. He left. Took all his stuff and some of mine... nothing worth being upset about just a charger, a couple packs of smokes and other stupid little things.\n\nI immediately broke the fuck down as in full on panic attack - on the floor hyperventilating with streams of tears down my eyes. I texted him, we fought a bit than eventually said he left cause i went on his facebook (I went on his fb on wednesday, he left monday). When i went on his FB I read a message saying \"yeah we can go get dope today, I just have to be home before my GF gets home at 4\". I was pissed but not too pissed cause he didn't go through with the plan. I thought we were over it. I thought we both understood I would not go on he FB again.... He always said his password outloud when we first started dating... I took it as a sign as it was ok...\n\nI was struggling HARD without him. Haven't ate, hardly slept and cried constantly. He contacted me 2 days after he left. He asked me for a ride to the town I live in. I thought to myself \"that's weird he knows absolutely NO ONE in my town\". So I freaked shit and said fuck no im not driving you to some girls house. He kept saying it was his homies house than that turned into his saying he wanted the ride to talk to me which than turned into him saying he actually needed the ride to \"fuck a bad bitch\".\n\nI was heartbroken. I was having 3 or 4 panic attacks for the next 2 days. On day 3, i was numb, couldn't focus on ANYTHING but work. I left work like great.. go home sleep the whole weekend... I couldn't sleep. We texted and argued some more. I kept asking him and stating he was trash for asking me to drive him to his new GF house.... which he technically never denied... So I tried to log onto his FB to see if he really wanted to talk or if he really just needed a ride to fuck a bad bitch. He changed his password. So I logged onto his Email - same password, cool. Reset Facebook password. Changed his password on FB and on Email. I went through his messages. He was talking to someone new already... WAIT... he was talking to her Sunday, the day before he left. Sunday - Monday he wasn't hitting on her. Just casual conversation. Tuesday - day after he left - he than started really hitting on her. I than processed to go through his google account. I went to google locations. He indeed went to get drugs and he also went to somewhere in my Town. I believe it was the girls house... right around the corner... I was soon than logged out.\n\nOMFG WHAT DID I DO! WHY DID I DO THAT! I 100% fucked up. I'm 100% hating myself. I'm so disappointed at myself and hurt to the point where I want to kill myself but also know I have to keep living.\n\nAfter my fucked up actions I drove myself into a psychosis. I took my anxiety meds to knock myself out. I took 3, normally 1 puts me on my ass. Although it didn't knock me out. So I took 4 more. It takes about a hour for the medication to kick in... so during this time... what did i do? I FUCKING LOG INTO HIS INSTAGRAM. I unblocked myself so I had a way to reach out. He logged me out almost immediately. I ended up messaging him that I was really sorry, I fucked up. I told him all the stress and me doing what I did drove me into a psychosis. I apologized for the breach of privacy. I also said goodbye and that id always have his back. He blocked me as expected.\n\nI have not reached out since - kinda cant since I'm blocked on everything but if there's a will there's a way.\n\nAnyways, I'm extremely numb today. Needed to vent this out and maybe hear some comments. I'm WAY to embarrassed to talk about any of this to anyone I know. I'm fucking stupid and pyscho. I just wanna feel something beside sadness and number... sorry for the long read.\n\nTLDR: Broke up, refused to give him a ride to what I assumed was another girls house which he never denied. Logged onto his FB changed his password. He logged me out. Put myself into a psychosis. Than logged onto his Insta, unblocked myself. Messaged i was deeply sorry.

I\u2019m not happy with some things, which frankly were issues all along but idk I guess I  stupidly thought it would change or maybe I\u2019m just less tolerant of now that I\u2019m older. Plus I\u2019m no walk in the park either and have some shit to work on that might be best to tackle alone. We have one of those when it\u2019s good it\u2019s fing amazing, when it\u2019s bad it really sucks kind of things going on.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed it many times, it felt like he didn\u2019t really believe I would end it. He definitely wants to stay together, but not change anything. His attitude about my concerns was pretty much \u201cwell, figure it out and let me know\u201d. He DID go to therapy with me for a bit but for me it was too little too late. \n\nI tried to break up with him like 3 times before he stopped convincing me not to and just accepted it. Plus I decided I was gonna move far away. We went NC for like 2 weeks and I stayed at a friend\u2019s. We met back up and discussed. \n\nWe were both pretty torn up. He wanted me to stay home and us be together until I move, in a bit over 1 month, and just enjoy the last bit of our time together. I wanted this too, because I still have a lot of love for him. But felt conflicted because I didn\u2019t want this to give him false hope. He said he understood that this is a final decision and will not try to change my mind.\n\nSo, I moved back in last week for the remainder of my time here. It\u2019s been going well! Until last night.\n\nWe had a really great night together but later on he started to get a bit drunk and obnoxious. I was tired and just wanted to snooze on the couch while he carried on with tv/video games/whatever. But he kept waking me up and trying to engage me in conversation and play fighting and stuff like that, every time I started to doze. After like an hour of that I got up and went to the bedroom. He got all bummed, I told him he could come with.\n\nWe laid down, and he immediately wants to have sex. He keeps pulling my pants down, putting my hand on his junk, etc. Kept reminding him that I\u2019m tired, plus that he\u2019s drunk and I\u2019m on a bad period. Promised him we\u2019ll fool around tomorrow. He finally accepts it.\n\nThen he starts asking if I\u2019m sleeping with someone else. (We agreed to remain exclusive til I go). He did this occasionally even back when we had a normal relationship. It infuriates me because I\u2019d never do anything close to cheat. And because I feel like he only throws this accusation out when he doesn\u2019t like something I\u2019m doing. I express my frustration and reassure him. He says he\u2019s just really insecure now because of everything going on now. I apologize and say I understand. Lays back down and watches something on his phone. I made a couple of comments here and there while I was drifting back off to sleep, but he was acting really irritated and giving me short responses in a nasty tone. I point it out and ask if he\u2019s still mad. He apologized and blamed it on his hearing, then tells me I can come cuddle him. I do and he asks if I want a kiss so I give him a peck. Then he wants to start tongue kissing (which he only ever does to lead to sex) and I was like ok nooo I want to go to bed remember? He gets mad and says stuff about how he just wants to soak up the last bit of time we have together and I don\u2019t care about him, I\u2019m done with him and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so annoyed and acting bitchy etc etc. I told him I don\u2019t want to fight, just cuddle and sleep. He called me an asshole and slammed the door. He slept in the guest room. \n\nThis morning when we woke up I told him all of it felt super manipulative and uncool, and I\u2019m not sure if our plan to stick together for the next month is going to work out.\n\nHe wants t sweep it under the rug, says he was just drunk and grumpy, being dramatic, he\u2019s having a hard time but it won\u2019t happen again. He was kind of laughing it off, acting like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. But we\u2019ve had similar arguments before when I reject him while he\u2019s drunk (I don\u2019t think this happens sober) and it always makes me feel like shit. And he gets to just say oh I was drunk ha ha but I\u2019m left still feeling like shit. I\u2019ve told him before I think he should quit drinking because of that kind of behavior but he said he doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nWell the rest of today he\u2019s very contrite and humorous and kind. Obviously damage control, but boy do I take comfort in these moments. Even when I feel more confident than ever that I\u2019m making the right choice to leave and get far away. I\u2019m making irreversible moves towards this goal as a means of holding myself accountable to it in case I get cold feet as it comes closer, because I know this is the right thing.\n\nAnyways, I guess that this has been a rant up until this point.\n\nHere\u2019s what I want to know.\n\nIf I\u2019m right calling this all manipulative and shitty if not abusive behavior?\n\nAnd the obvious answer of what to do will be to move back out. But am I wrong for just wanting to see it through this last month still? I know it\u2019s causing some pain for us both, but we both perversely want to continue.

It was 12 hours before the time I said I was free and he never responded.

He is a recovering addict but has been clean for almost a year (he became clean of his \"main\" drug almost 2 years ago but quit drugs completely a couple months AFTER we began dating). His behavior at the beginning of the relationship isn't something that he's proud of-- he used to be very disrespectful to me when he got upset.

I'm glad I stayed though, because as he's gotten clean, he's become someone he's proud to be (his words not mine) and has become a much more calm person as well. Sometimes though, I see his anger bubble up again when he's exasperated at a situation-- and it scares me. He doesn't make me feel physically unsafe, but seeing my partner angry is a big trigger for me due to past trauma, so you can see how his anger issues/temper might become a problem. He's definitely put some major work into his temper though (it's not like he's not trying). He is usually able to be a very calm person, but there are things that just get to him sometimes.

I wouldn't mind this, but they always try to include me in everything: my bf playfully teases me in front of everyone, they crack jokes and look to me for my input, they always try to get me to talk to them. I have no problem being around larger groups, but I hate feeling the pressure of being forced to join the conversation, I'm much more of a listener/watcher. There's nothing worse than when someone says something and then turns to me and is like \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, what do you think?\" and then all eyes are on me for a response. It gets me SO incredibly anxious, and I feel like I'm painting myself in a bad light to his family because I'm not as fun as they are, which fuels my anxiety even more, and then it just becomes this vicious cycle. \n\nWhen we're out with his friends I tend to cling to him, which I realise is probably annoying for him.

If so, how can I be better?\n\nI\u2019ve been wondering about this for a while now. About a year ago, I (17 F) introduced one of my newer friends (we\u2019ll call her S (17 F)) to another friend of mine that I\u2019ve known since middle school, L (also 17F). We started a project together, and things were going well at first, but then school started, and S and I got busy.\n\nLong story short, a series of events occurred that ended with L calling both S and I, individually, to tell us how she thought we weren\u2019t contributing. She was angry on my call, but reasonable (she\u2019d gotten her mom involved in the situation a few months ago, and she\u2019d yelled at us to do more work, which was why S and I weren\u2019t comfortable involving ourselves in the project again.) However, according to S, L called her and yelled at her for two hours about how she hadn\u2019t been doing anything, and how she was only friends with her because S was friends with me. She also said that I had been complaining to her about the lack of work S had been doing for months and how demanding she was (not true.)\n\nWe texted after about our phone calls, and S, while hurt by the implications, confronted me about whether or not I\u2019d said all of that stuff about her. I said no, and proceeded to reassure her over text.\n\nI\u2019m going to be honest; I thought that after we\u2019d talked about the phone calls, we were on the same page, and that we had each other\u2019s backs. But I guess we weren\u2019t, and that she didn\u2019t trust me very much, because I think she believed that I had been saying stuff about her behind her back, because after this phone call, S stopped talking to me at school. We had about two and a half weeks left until the end of the school year, and she just\u2026froze me out. We had a few classes together, and she just stopped speaking to me. She\u2019d ignore me when I said hi, and would turn and face someone else/pretend not to see me when I entered the room.\u00a0\n\nIt hurt badly. I was unsure of where my friendship stood with L\u2014and now, S was acting like she didn\u2019t even know me. I cried a lot during those weeks, because it felt like all of my close friends had just\u2026left. I just felt so alone. Lost, empty\u2026I won\u2019t lie, I had some dark thoughts during that time.\u00a0\n\nI wasn\u2019t mad at S. She needed time alone, I guess, and she really shouldn\u2019t have had to think about anyone\u2019s wellbeing but her own. If removing herself from my life made her happy, who was I to judge?\u00a0\n\nRandomly, she texted me at the end of the year and invited me to eat out with a group to celebrate our last day. I said yes, and we talked like everything was fine. Later, we hung out again, and things were fine. Then, I commented on an insta post from L, saying that she looked cute.\u00a0\n\nS sent me a long letter about how I\u2019d been a bad friend to her, and why she felt that way after seeing that comment. After reading it, I felt like shit. She asked why I\u2019d comment that on L\u2019s post when she had hurt her so badly, and mentioned other times in the past when she\u2019d felt like I was being a bad friend. She told me that she was hanging out with other people and that she loved how it felt, that it made her feel good, which was why she pulled back. Implying, I guess, that being around me made her feel bad. I don\u2019t know how to explain what I felt. Hurt, of course, but also so guilty. I hadn\u2019t realized I was making her feel this way.\u00a0\n\nL and I have been best friends since middle school, and I\u2019d let go of my anger towards her a long time ago. We all make mistakes, and after S stopped talking to me, I just...couldn\u2019t muster up any anger. I was so tired.\n\nI apologized, and we made up, but things haven\u2019t been the same. We\u2019ve definitely been drifting apart, and both of us know it. I never told her how badly she\u2019d hurt me when she stopped talking to me. I didn\u2019t want to invalidate her feelings by making it into a competition about who\u2019d been hurt more - or that she\u2019d left first. I lost a lot of trust in her, because of it, and I think she feels the same way about me.\u00a0\n\nRecently, she made comments about how some other people that she knows are always there for each other, and have each other\u2019s backs no matter what. She made this point multiple times, and has in the past. It was clear that she was directing her comments to me, because she has mentioned, in the past, how I\u2019ve been a bad friend by talking to people that she\u2019s fallen out with/has been hurt by in the past.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m never quite sure what to say to her when she talks about this. She\u2019s on good terms with them now, but it\u2019s clear she\u2019d still rather that I not speak with them. Both of them were kind to me before I became friends with her, and to be honest, I don\u2019t want to cut them off after what happened before last summer. It seems like she wants me to only be her friend, but she has a lot of other close friends.\u00a0\n\nThe three of us met again, and as we were talking, S sent me a text saying that she felt ignored because L wasn\u2019t looking at her. I responded by saying I noticed that, though I hadn\u2019t. I know I made a mistake here, because, here\u2019s the thing\u2014she was. Once again, I didn\u2019t know what to say and didn\u2019t want to invalidate her feelings. I tried to involve her in the convo after that, but she was on her phone, and wouldn\u2019t look at me when I spoke to her. I texted her after asking if there was anything I could have done to make the situation better for her. She responded by asking why I bothered to ask if I wasn\u2019t going to stand up for her anyways, and that it was clear I was only asking to make myself feel like a good friend.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t want to hurt her, but when I try to help, I think I just make things worse.\u00a0\n\nAs I\u2019m typing this, I\u2019m realizing that this is a toxic situation. It\u2019s clear that neither of us really fully trust the other, and that we clearly don\u2019t know what the other person wants\u2014(me more so than her.)\n\nI love her a lot though, and we really were pretty good friends before all of this. I hate what our friendship has become and I want to fix it, because I do think I\u2019m the main problem. I think that my \u2018lack of loyalty\u2019 and my \u2018inability to stand up for her\u2019 is a deeper personal issue\u2014I\u2019m a quiet person, and I\u2019ve never been able to stand up for myself.\n\nBasically, I think she wants something from me that I just can\u2019t give\u2014that I don\u2019t know how to give. Or at least she did. Not really sure what\u2019s going to happen at school once I go back. Either way, this situation is ripping me apart\u2014I don\u2019t want to see her feel bad, or make her feel bad, but I think that nothing I do is ever good enough.\n\nI texted her and asked if we could call in about an hour to talk.\n\n Any advice?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: my friend and I have had a rocky relationship because of another friend, who I've known for longer.

My roommate is LOUD. I don\u2019t mean loud like he blasts music, he is just a super loud person. (our rooms are right next to each othrt) He walks up the stairs loudly, cooks loudly, talks loudly etc. I have no problem with this except on the weekends and in the morning. On the weekends I generally stay in and he goes out and gets drunk. When he gets home, without fail at 2-3 AM he comes in like a damn bull in a china shop. He will bang pretty much everything it seems in the kicthen, stomp up the stairs, and often talk loudly on the phone. It wakes me up every weekend.

We were getting alone, so I thought. We only dated for 4 months. It was the best 4 months I had for a couple year. I struggle with depression, PTSD and I'm also Bipolar. Although I feel more autistic than bipolar. He made everything slightly more manageable in life. Him being around gave me motivation to eat properly (hard cooking a whole meal for just yourself), him being around helped me watch TV (cant watch it by myself, it makes me sleepy within 20mins), Him being around made me want to be the best we could be (adulting, building an empire). Our only real issues were, we hardly had sex nd his addiction problem. Hes been clean for four months - basically when he left the hospital and started hanging with me. He did relapse a couple times which hurt me but I forgave him within a day or so. I understood from the beginning of our relationship a relapse will happen every so often.\n\nMonday morning, I woke up in a very bad mood. PMS and being horny as fuck. I tried to turn him on by being big spoon and reaching over to fondle him BUT his dick was tucked. His dick as always tucked whenever I tried to make the mooooves. So anyways I woke up in the worse mood and told him we needed to have sex more. Once a week wasn't enough for me.  I told him if we didn't start fucking more he will need to start trying to find another place to live. We didnt say much more after that. I got ready for work and during work we texted about it. I thought we were talking it out to figure it out. He stated he talked to his friend about what i said and his friend say \"sounds like yall just need to fuck and get over it.\".... So I thought ayye he's right. Communication than stopped. I Left work to go home cook us a steak dinner and cuddle up watching Netflix, but he was gone. He left. Took all his stuff and some of mine... nothing worth being upset about just a charger, a couple packs of smokes and other stupid little things.\n\nI immediately broke the fuck down as in full on panic attack - on the floor hyperventilating with streams of tears down my eyes. I texted him, we fought a bit than eventually said he left cause i went on his facebook (I went on his fb on wednesday, he left monday). When i went on his FB I read a message saying \"yeah we can go get dope today, I just have to be home before my GF gets home at 4\". I was pissed but not too pissed cause he didn't go through with the plan.  I thought we were over it. I thought we both understood I would not go on he FB again.... He always said his password outloud when we first started dating... I took it as a sign as it was ok...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was struggling HARD without him. Haven't ate, hardly slept and cried constantly. He contacted me 2 days after he left. He asked me for a ride to the town I live in. I thought to myself \"that's weird he knows absolutely NO ONE in my town\". So I freaked shit and said fuck no im not driving you to some girls house. He kept saying it was his homies house than that turned into his saying he wanted the ride to talk to me which than turned into him saying he actually needed the ride to \"fuck a bad bitch\".\n\nI was heartbroken. I was having 3 or 4 panic attacks for the next 2 days. On day 3, i was numb, couldn't focus on ANYTHING but work. I left work like great.. go home sleep the whole weekend... I couldn't sleep. We texted and argued some more. I kept asking him and stating he was trash for asking me to drive him to his new GF house.... which he technically never denied... So I tried to log onto his FB to see if he really wanted to talk or if he really just needed a ride to fuck a bad bitch. He changed his password. So I logged onto his Email - same password, cool. Reset Facebook password. Changed his password on FB and on Email. I went through his messages. He was talking to someone new already... WAIT... he was talking to her Sunday, the day before he left. Sunday - Monday he wasn't hitting on her. Just casual conversation. Tuesday - day after he left - he than started really hitting on her. I than processed to go through his google account. I went to google locations. He indeed went to get drugs and he also went to somewhere in my Town. I believe it was the girls house... right around the corner... I was soon than logged out.\n\nOMFG WHAT DID I DO! WHY DID I DO THAT! I 100% fucked up. I'm 100% hating myself. I'm so disappointed at myself and hurt to the point where I want to kill myself but also know I have to keep living.\n\nAfter my fucked up actions I drove myself into a psychosis. I took my anxiety meds to knock myself out. I took 3, normally 1 puts me on my ass. Although it didn't knock me out. So I took 4 more. It takes about a hour for the medication to kick in... so during this time... what did i do? I FUCKING LOG INTO HIS INSTAGRAM. I unblocked myself so I had a way to reach out. He logged me out almost immediately. I ended up messaging him that I was really sorry, I fucked up. I told him all  the stress and me doing what I did drove me into a psychosis. I apologized for the breach of privacy. I also said goodbye and that id always have his back. He blocked me as expected.\n\nI have not reached out since - kinda cant since I'm blocked on everything but if there's a will there's a way.\n\nAnyways, I'm extremely numb today. Needed to vent this out and maybe hear some comments. I'm WAY to embarrassed to talk about any of this to anyone I know. I'm fucking stupid and pyscho. I just wanna feel something beside sadness and number... sorry for the long read.\n\nTLDR: Broke up, refused to give him a ride to what I assumed was another girls house which he never denied. Logged onto his FB changed his password. He logged me out. Put myself into a psychosis. Than logged onto his Insta, unblocked myself. Messaged i was deeply sorry.

I was fine with it. He set up a group chat for us to talk in. She was definitely a third wheel, and let us know she was mad about it. She said she's jealous of our relationship, and got mad whenever I mentioned something I liked that he did. I mean.. she was coming into our relationship expecting to be on the same level as me. Not happening. She was literally just someone to have a threesome with on occasion (if it worked out). I started thinking maybe I didn't want to have a threesome because of how much I started to feel like I was having to walk on egg shells. Time went on, and I realized it was her I wasn\u2019t ok with, not the threesome. She just rubbed me the wrong way from the get go. She was so overbearing from the very start. Getting jealous over literally nothing, and getting really snarky with me for no absolutely no reason whatsoever. She admitted she was just jealous about how close me and the guy were. I mean the most we really talked about was our day to day lives, and if we mentioned the guy it was basically \u201cOh hey I texted him today.\u201d or \u201cWe texted all day.\u201d and some \u201cwe sexy talked.\u201d There\u2019s never been specifics ever given after I started walking on egg shells.\n\nAnyways the guy has been on a leave of absence (it happens sadly) and well he never warned he was going to poof for a bit, so she started venting to me.

I just didn\u2019t tell her that day we set up a time to get together, because I didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings that he left her out.

I tried to be a great boyfriend and I bought her everything she wanted, I bought her clothes, a ring like I think I spoilt her basing this off the way she treated me.\n\nSo now rewind around 2 months back, I feel like something is going on, and I\u2019m a bit suspicious in our relationship, so I messaged her best friend as she has no reason to \u201clie\u201d to me. So I ask her if there is someone else and everything, and it turns out she hides it for the first hour but then she decided to tell me the truth and what I got was a voice note saying \u201cdon\u2019t think your the only one\u201d. So after that I was begging her to tell me who it is and eventually I got the truth out of her and it turns out she dated another guy. It really hurt and oh well after a few days I really had a strong connection with her so I forgave her and we started loving each other again. Now after that I would have a few trust issues and I would be suspicious for no reason some times but it stopped after a week or two.

I blocked her straight away and I hadn\u2019t  talked to her for a full week until today.\n\nShe tried to explain herself and explain herself over and over again but all she did was lie like she always had done to me. I tried to forgive her and I told her because I just hate breaking hearts that if she blocked him, posted on her story that her and him are over and gave me her Instagram again I would try a healthy relationship again with her. But what happens is I log into her Instagram, the first thing I see is her commenting on his post, \u201cI love you baby \u2764\ufe0f\u201d. So I do what any other person would do and confront her, the only thing she has to say is that she used me just to get with another guy. \nI was furious, I still am, I blocked her right away and right now I\u2019m drinking a cup of hot chocolate trying to clear my mind letting out all of this. \n\nI hope this teaches you, if she cheats once, she\u2019s not worth the second chance.

She said that she didn't see it quite like dates but 'chilling activities' and mentioned that she prefers to not want to have 'labels' associated between us (like having the girlfriend-boyfriend label so people wouldn't see us like that, but as friends). I figured she meant that she wanted to keep our relationship private but she confirmed and said she wanted for us to see each other like that as well. I said it was weird for two individuals to view each other simply as 'friends' if their intimate relationship progresses but she said that she views the word 'friends' as a broad term and treats me differently than her other friends, also suggesting we have cultural differences on how we look at relationships due to being raised in different countries. \n\nThis had me confused because I still don't know what this entails and unsure of what to find out to make sure I am hopefully not being led on. She's been completely honest and transparent about everything so far so I'm not sure of what to do.\n\n**tldr; Girl I like wants us to view each other as friends to not be labelled as 'boyfriend-girlfriend' both publicly and privately but also wants to maintain a close intimate relationship**", "title": "Am I being led on or misunderstanding this girl?"}, {"created_utc": 1632617578, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pvje7t/would_it_be_unrealistic_to_expect_someone_to/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Would it be unrealistic to expect someone to enter a sexless relationship?"}, {"created_utc": 1632617516, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pvjdm3/my_boyfriend_gets_drunk_with_his_friends_but_not/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "My boyfriend gets drunk with his friends but not me"}, {"created_utc": 1632617318, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pvjbqh/i_think_my_boyfriend_still_has_feelings_for_his/", "num_comments": 11, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've (female 39) been dating my boyfriend (male 38) for just over 6 years now and I don't think he is over his ex girlfriend. He dated her for 5 years and had split for a couple years prior to us starting to date. I have suspected this throughout our relationship and have brought it up multiple times, only to be told I am being jealous or overreacting and that he is indeed \"over her.\"\n\nExamples:\n\n1. When we first started dating we went to visit his family back east for the holidays and went to a party that she and his friends were at. When we got home he told his mother that she was there and she said \"good riddance\" and he said (in front of me) \"she's not going anywhere.\" When I asked him about that he said oh its because they share mutual friends. During this trip he also messaged her that I would be there but that I was \"jealous.\" A message that was later deleted.\n2. I have seen his search history on our shared computer checking her facebook/socials many times over the years\n3. I asked him if he could unfollow her because I felt him checking in on her was disrespectful and he put up a big fight saying that he is allowed to be friends with his ex if he wants to and they ended on good terms. He eventually unfollowed her. She still follows him and likes his photos often.\n4. He recently told me that he was not over her when we first started dating\n5. He says they occasionally keep in touch as friends but that he hasn't spoken to her in a long time\n6. Today I saw that she liked his post today, so I looked at her profile. She has been living/working about 8 hours away from us all summer (she is from the other side of the country), and he liked her post from 2 days ago. Keep in mind he does not follow her. So he had to have looked her up. When I came home 2 nights ago, he had gone to bed early - said he was just tired and had his back to me in bed. So either he just found out she is out here or he has know this whole time. I don't know if they are still talking, but I suspect so.\n\nNow, I have been waiting for him to step up in terms of marriage and starting a family. I am 39, and I really want to settle down. We talk about this often. Lately as of the past month or so he has been very on board, talking about starting a family in the next couple months and also looking at rings. But I am worried that he is still hung up on her and is only saying yes to marriage/kids because he feels pressured. I have talked to him very openly about it, saying I don't want him to feel pressured and if he needs time thats ok! But I am running out of time and if he has doubts then it is only fair that we go our own ways. But he insists that our relationship is what he wants.\n\nWhat would be the best course of action: staying and accepting that maybe he has old feelings or leave and move on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR!

We both live in the same city (but not close) but both of us go to the countryside on Summer vacation and that's basically the only time I see her, some of our mutual friends also do the exact same thing (I met all of them including her there). Before, I wasn't into her and wasn't *that* much of a friend either until I just got to know her better because us and our friends hung out more this Summer compared to previous ones and we also had a group chat where all of us message each other very actively when it's not Summer and we're not together.\n\nWe are both introverted and extremely shy. Yes, we are comfortable around each other and our friends and we talk freely like that, we are pretty open about sexual jokes and stuff like that too (not personal topics, just jokes) even in our group chat. I don't like to go fast on relationships, I like to progress slowly but surely (so does she) and I'm not the guy to want girlfriends just because and stuff like that y'know, I only like girls who I've known for a long time and know that they are a genuinely great person and if, our relationship grows further, a great girlfriend. Anyways, when I felt brave enough to do it, I told her I liked her but in text **(mainly because we're both super shy but also because our friends would find it weird to see just the two of us being together since almost everytime we hang out there's at least 3 of us and both of our families would also find it weird I think (my family likes to tease me whenever a friend of mine is a girl (they mean it harmlessly, but I don't like it)))** and she told me that she also likes me back. After that, us and another friend of ours (because it would be very obvious if it were just us) decided to watch movies at our friend's house together like every other day so that's when we were the closest to each other. We haven't ever spoken about our relationship in person since we're both extremely shy, in fact, we haven't even held hands or touched (I don't mean sexually, like, literally).\n\nSo it was nearing the end of Summer when some of us were soon to leave and we still continued watching movies like normal and one day we just watched the movie at night and since we were watching it at our friend's house (which is a bit farther than ours) we were going to our homes and were just having a random conversation **(actually, it was something a tad bit personal but not anything flirty or something)** and I just really wanted to hug her since nobody was outside and it was dark but I held myself back. When we went home I texted her about that and asked if we could watch the movie at night the next time too and if we could hug and she said yes. But then at the day we were gonna watch the movie, my dentist called that she was busy all the time until next month but tomorrow and that I must've come there tomorrow (to tighten my braces) morning so we (me and my mom) had to go to the city that day. It really sucked because that was the last time I saw her in person and didn't even get a hug because by the time I went back to my countryside she had already left for the city to stay because Summer vacation was nearing its end.\n\nSo after that we started chatting online more than ever (but still not super actively), because of our shyness we haven't really had deep talks about our relationship but we did throw in a little flirty text like an occasional \"you're cute\" or \"I miss you\". There's really no way that only the two of us can meet in the city like at a park and/or at a mall and any of that because as much as we both would love to, our families would know about it (which we don't want before our relationship goes deeper) because we can't just go out on our own, our parents are a little strict about it and ask all about who you're going with and where and stuff like that. Like, *I* could lie and say I'm going out with my male friend but since she's a girl, her parents are a little more strict about it.\n\nThe only three days we can meet before Summer is on my birthday in January, her birthday in May and a meet-up with us and our mutual friends (from our countryside) at a park or something.\n\nI don't know why I made this text so long and I bet only a super small amount of people got to here.\n**The reason I posted this here is because I need some advice to maybe be less shy around her, tips to get closer to her both emotionally *and* physically, and generally relationship advice for shy-ass people like us.\nPlease ask *ANY* question you have and I'll be happy to answer to all of them!**", "title": "A Very Shy Couple"}, {"created_utc": 1632614244, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pvih7y/me_26_m_and_gf_32_f_we_are_together_over_6_years/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Me [26 M] and gf [32 F] we are together over 6 years, she wants open relationship.I dont want and we broke up.Give advices."}, {"created_utc": 1632613964, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pvieku/kiss_burping/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Kiss burping"}, {"created_utc": 1632613919, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pvie4a/partner_may_not_be_over_his_ex_is_my_head_in_the/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Partner may not be over his ex - Is my head in the sand?"}, {"created_utc": 1632613877, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pvidrc/earrings/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Earrings"}, {"created_utc": 1632613799, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pvicy1/what_do_i_do/", "num_comments": 11, "score": 1, "selftext": "TL;DR voyeurism(?), relationship problems, boyfriend family\n\nMy little sister has suspected that my boyfriend (26M) of 8 years has secretly filmed her.

I'm doing a lot better now, but I'm still a bit wobbly - my most recent ex did some really messed up stuff and it kinda set me back a bit.  \n  \nK and I got together this summer, but we'd been friends for a few years before then. It's been going really really well, despite having to deal with weird situations caused by my ex and my slightly dodgy mental health status. He gets very worried about accidentally upsetting me or hurting me which I don't think is necessary.

I was recently married, am currently expecting and was in my second trimester during the wedding, sister was my bridesmaid, as were my other 2 sisters. My maid of honor was my closest friend over the pandemic. In February my MOH and my eldest sister started a romantic relationship. Over the course of wedding planning, there were several large arguments over small inconsequential things (for example- how I would be creating a body form for my wedding dress that I was making, and how many days I would afford my family before leaving for our honeymoon). The day after the wedding as we were cleaning the wedding venue (which we were responsible for), my sister became enraged by my asking my father for help with a task while we were gone and also at when we were leaving for our trip. I angrily slammed a sliding door between her and I and walked away from her as she was expressing herself and I continued walking away as she chased me, antagonized me, screamed after me, and told me I deserved to be treated that way and worse for my apparent bridezilla behaviour before and during the wedding. I haven't spoken with her since and am torn between levelling with her, and leaving and staying out of contact with her. \n\n\nThis short blurb doesn't really do justice to the build up of hurt feelings, frustration and loss of trust, nor the history of my friendship with my sister.. and honestly, I don't know if I'll even post this.

He told me he doesn't talk to any and just stays in the house all day. He turned the question on me and asked how many guys did I talk to and I mentioned 8 guys(which is not true). I also told him that it's nothing serious. On the phone he also mentioned my boss cause my boss saw him talking to me and was staring at us. He called my boss weird and all types of names but I defended him due to the good relationship I had with my boss. He asked me did I have a crush on my boss but I replied no.\n\nWe talked consistently for two days on text until like maybe after a day or two, he slowly began to reply to me very slowly after I denied many of his calls. The reason why I don't answer his calls is because I'm in the house with a bunch of people (mom,grandma, kids,) and it's hard to speak to him. So I guess he got upset and felt like I was ignoring him. So I texted him one morning to start a conversation, and he started texting me again and said he felt like I was dodging him. Whats odd about this is, everything I felt he was doing to me(never mentioned it to him), he was accusing me for but maybe I was actually doing the unintentionally. I told him the reason I haven't been answering his calls and he said he understood and wished I would've told him. So for a few more days everything was okay..except for a short moment he got upset when I made a joke where I said forgot his name and it pissed him off and texted me that \"he was tired of me\". I said bye and he was like bye but I apologized and said I was joking. \n\nIt stayed good until Saturday(two days ago) we stayed on the phone for 5 hours from afternoon till night. While we were talking he tried to Facetime me but I denied it. I don't look good on camera which is the REAL reason why I don't answer but he finds it fishy. I made some excuse like I don't have much clothes on. The next morning when I woke up he called me again as soon as he got off. I asked him why was he still up, did he go to sleep and what time is he going. He told me he stayed up to speak to me (which he does stay up to speak to me before going to bed but don't know how true that is) and wanted me to come see him. I told him I had plans and out of nowhere he told me felt like I was playing him and asked me was he on my agenda since I'm only interested in talking to him at night.

I asked him why does he think I'm playing him and he said only I would be the one to know that answer. Then he tried to Facetime me but I denied it again like the previous night. He tried to call on Facetime again but I denied it.  So a few minutes he tells me he had to go call his cousin and will call me later tonight.

She also mentioned that she \u201csees\u201d me all day (I WFH) but can\u2019t talk to me and is frustrated about it. \n\nAlso, when she gets home from her art project (around 9pm, because she end up eating dinner with her mom every night), I always make sure to be done with my stuff so I have time for her.\n\nWhen we spend time together, we end up just binge watching TV which I don\u2019t really enjoy doing. I would rather work on my project that makes me happy, and around 7pm have dinner and spend the evening with her.\n\nWe also can\u2019t do a lot of things because she doesn\u2019t have money to pay for anything. I do pay for some dates, but I\u2019m not going to pay for everything all the time. So most of the time the only thing we have is watch TV..\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do, am I an A for not spending more time with her? I just feel it\u2019s a little unfair, she gets to do fun stuff she loves all day, but because I\u2019ve a job, I can\u2019t really do what makes me happy and always have to adapt to her schedule.\n\nTDLR: girlfriend is mad when I work on my side project instead of spending time with her.

Ever since, there\u2019s just been a weird vibe and creeping suspicion they have feelings for my girlfriend, and have said stuff that kind of hints towards it, but never when I\u2019m there. \n\nFor example, John told my gf that they were having dreams about her, when she slept over in their dorm to keep them company because they felt really lonely after their break up and their roommate wasn\u2019t around (who we are all good friends with). My gf slept over the next night as well with John\u2019s room mate as well, and they all stayed up until 4am talking and John was laying in my gf\u2019s lap for a while\n\nAnother example is from couple days ago, John asked my gf if she wanted to smoke together but said they wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable doing it with me or our other friend (John\u2019s roommate) and same with drinking. \n\nAll three of us hang out a lot and ever since our friend and their girlfriend broke up, the dynamic has slowly started to change. However, last night was on a totally different level.\n\nI felt like I was third wheeling the entire time and like I was competing with John. Like there was a love triangle going on. When we all hang out we try to make it feel like we\u2019re all just friends, we don\u2019t want John to feel like they\u2019re third wheeling my gf and I, but we aren\u2019t just going to act like we\u2019re not in love, you know?\n\nTonight John would never talk to me directly, they only asked my gf things, like talking about the gym and then John says \u201c(my gf) would you go to the gym with me?\u201d Or skydiving and John says \u201cwould you go skydiving with me (my gf)?\u201d And then pillow forts and John says \u201c(my gf) would you build a pillow fort with me\u201d and then about all of us getting a hotel room together and I said \u201cmaybe not tonight\u201d and John says \u201cwell (my gf) would you want to get a hotel room with me?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve thirdwheeled a lot in my life so far, and I don\u2019t want to make anyone else feel like they\u2019re third wheeling, but feeling like I\u2019m third wheeling my girlfriend and her best friend and competing in a love triangle just feels shitty. My gf wasn\u2019t doing anything to make me feel like this, I it was all coming from John.\n\nRecently I also feel quite awkward around the both of them because John doesn\u2019t talk about their break up in front of me, the only person they want to talk about it with, or WILL talk about it with is my gf. And I know they do want to talk about it, so a lot of the time it feels like when John wants to hang out, they don\u2019t want to hang out with me, they want to hang out with my girlfriend so they can talk about it, but I also want to feel included.\n\nWhat do I do in this situation?

We get along really good. Shes super sweet, we have the same sense of humor, never fight, and spend a lot of time together. so we were at a party last weekend that we got invited to by a friend, she had a male friend that was there that she has known for a long time before we started talking, they were both roomates together but she got her own place cause they werent working out but remained friends. She\u2019s told me this guy has flirted with her but she\u2019s turned him down and told him they\u2019re only friends. she told me she worked in a male dominated field and told me early on she had a few male friends but she draws a hard line with them and never sees them as anything but platonic.\n\nAt the party at one point they were talking so I walked off to let them chat, a few minutes later I see she\u2019s all up on his arm with her head rested against his shoulder. She\u2019s like this for probably ten minutes, I got pissed and went up to her and told her I was ready to go as it was very late. I was visibly mad which caused her to cry so I told her why I was upset, she said that she was consoling him over a girl that just broke up with him, which he did mention to us earlier in the night. As a roommate she claimed they were pretty close but she still insisted it was only a friend connection. She was crying all the way home telling me she really loved me and she was so sorry if she did something that hurt my feelings. She said she was just drunk and felt bad for him and was being consoling. She said she\u2019d block him and let me have all her social media passwords so I know she\u2019s not cheating. I told her id give her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThe next day we were fine and back to being happy, but later as I was sitting next to her I see a text from him  asking if she could talk about what happened last night as she was showing me something on her phone, she was crying outside of the party as we were leaving and he had seen it, it was a whole scene. She responded that I was really tired and just wanted to get going and she thought I was mad at her but everything was fine. He responded \u201cno I wanna talk about what happened before that\u201d. This made me really upset but I didn\u2019t bring it up right away, she sent a couple more texts while I wasn't looking. Later I brought up that I saw the text he sent and wanted to know what he wanted to talk about that happened before we left, I asked her to show me the texts and they were deleted except one new exchange, that gave me a red flag. she was acting like in her texts she didnt know what happened.\n\nI asked her to text him what happened specifically as she claims she was drunk and didn\u2019t remember. He responded \u201cwell you told me you missed me for one\u201d She still claimed she didn\u2019t know what he was talking about as she was really drunk. She was also crying by this point so she went to the bathroom, while she was in the bathroom I heard her talking to this man and she told him the whole story that she didn\u2019t want to hurt me and that I wanted confirmation of what happened. She got out and told me I could talk to him on the phone and he\u2019d tell me what happened, I told her she could of just talked to him in the bathroom and he\u2019s just gonna tell me what i want to hear. She denied she was talking to him and was just talking to a friend, even though I heard her. At this point she was really upset telling me she loved me again crying, she told me she would block him and not talk to him ever again. I didn\u2019t know what to do, I told her i loved her but I  needed some space for a day or to process what happened. She said ok and I left. I really love her, what we had felt like it was perfect and dont want to lose her, but cant be played. Should I tell her to cut this guy off or do I break up with her?

I\u2019m a feminist, he has lots of very sexist views. He\u2019s often casually racist or homophobic which also grinds my gears. He also often behaves like he\u2019s superior to most other people; he never really apologizes for anything because the fault always lies with someone else in his mind\u2026 I can\u2019t even stand to be in a car with him because he complains about literally every other driver and pedestrian even when they objectively haven\u2019t done anything.

I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 for almost 8 years (engaged just over 1, have wedding date for next November). Lots of ups and downs like most relationships. I\u2019ve been going through a pretty major depressive episode the past several months, she\u2019s been fully aware and trying to help me through it. Just a bit more context, when I met her she smoked cigarettes, I told her that she was special to me and I didn\u2019t want her to keep smoking - she was trying to quit at that time. A few months into our relationship, she moved on to nicotine gum which she chewed for maybe 5 years, and until the past 2 years she moved over to chewing regular gum (but intensely, clearly still has some lingering nicotine addiction). She\u2019s a very health conscious person now, doesn\u2019t eat foods that are very unhealthy, doesn\u2019t eat pork, barely eats meat, regularly exercising and trying to be well. \n\nThis past weekend we went back to my hometown for my childhood friend\u2019s wedding, and I was in the wedding party. Friday night we did a rehearsal dinner and went over to his place to hang out. The groomsmen were all going upstairs to smoke weed. I haven\u2019t smoked in almost 15 years, not at all against it, but I just never wanted to risk my career so I never considered it. She encouraged me to go with them, encouraged me to smoke because I always talk about wanting to do it again, so I did that. It was like my first time smoking as a teenager, where I felt almost nothing. But we were up there hanging out for over an hour.\n\nI come back downstairs, my fianc\u00e9 seemed irritated that I was gone for so long. She asked me if I smoked I said yes, she said she told me to tell her if I do it (turns out I got a text from her 10 minutes after I got downstairs, never came through because service was bad). She hardly knows these people. Within a few minutes of being downstairs, she stands up with a few others and starts walking outside, I know the others are going to smoke cigarettes, and I trust her and just assumed she went outside to continue a conversation. As I\u2019m following her, she shoves me back before I reach the porch door - not violent or aggressive, but enough to stop me. I stayed back inside, the vibe inside was weird so after 5 minutes I went back on the porch. Immediately when I get out there, it\u2019s super awkward, she tells me to go back inside which at this point raised a red flag. I playfully told her that she must have been talking shit about me, she says no so I just stand around in this uncomfortable feeling. Her hand is hidden at her waist, and I trust her so I don\u2019t think a thing, but once she realized I\u2019m not going anywhere she lifts a cigarette from her side and hits it. My stomach sort of sank, it brought back a ton of trauma from past relationships of being lied to, I just quietly kept to myself the remaining hour of the night. My emotions went numb because it brought me back to some bad places in my mind. One of my childhood friends were trying to carry on a casual conversation with me, assuming because they could he I was off, and my fianc\u00e9 was saying \u201cthat\u2019s his mad face\u201d, \u201che must be mad\u201d, \u201cwhat are you mad about?\u201d To me, it felt like mocking. My friend who I rarely see had to jump in and tell her that I said I\u2019m fine, to get her to stop. This is part A of why I am upset with her.\n\nNight ended, we got in the car, I told her I have a ton on my mind and I don\u2019t want to speak. She kept pushing, I kept repeating I don\u2019t want to talk, until I snapped. I told her that I don\u2019t trust her anymore, it goes against this health conscious character she made me believe she is, that I question what else I don\u2019t know about, etc. I was an asshole here, I know, I let it all out. She then tried to record me in the car ride, which was super weird, and said it\u2019s because I was being abusive. I realized I was out of line, so I just tried to keep to myself again.\n\nPart B of why I\u2019m upset is what she did during the car ride and after, including up until last night. She tried so hard to make me question everything, she said they handed cigarettes to her right in front of me (didn\u2019t see it that way), she claimed to have shoved me playfully (I can sort of see it), she claimed to have told me to go back inside playfully (didn\u2019t see it). She pressed on about how my memory of the incident is incorrect. She then tried to divert it to saying that it\u2019s because I was high, which I wasn\u2019t, and even my childhood friend said I barely had any and there is no way I was high, and he let me drive us home. Then she pressed on about \u201cit was just two hits of a cigarette, what you smoked was illegal\u201d to try to deflect it. I explained to her that even if it was something like her going outside to eat a pork chop (something that also goes against her character), the situation of her actively trying to hide it and minimize it is the part I\u2019m upset about. Then she tried to deflect and say I was being abusive, which granted that I was very bad I will admit, but it was not the problem at hand. She tried to cry to make me feel bad saying she doesn\u2019t understand how I could throw 8 years away over \u201ca couple puffs of a cigarette\u201d. Yesterday she tried to bring up mistakes I have made in the past in our relationship (not cheating, I\u2019d never do that), and how she recovered from that, so this shouldn\u2019t be a big deal - just completely unrelated. I just explained to her the more I think back on the situation and I listen to her tell the \u201ctruth\u201d, the less it makes sense, and that\u2019s not how truth works. She just cannot give me an explanation about what happened besides she was being playful, which does not make any sense. On the car ride back home from the weekend, she read the back of a Mentos breath mint label and said she didn\u2019t want one because it\u2019s unhealthy - I told her that she makes no sense if she doesn\u2019t eat a Mentos because it\u2019s unhealthy but then smokes a cigarette and justifies it. In her defense, I haven\u2019t always been the nicest, she has always been patient with me, and my depressive episode has been awful this time around, probably the worst in my life.\n\nI can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m overreacting because of my past relationship trauma or not. I just saw something in her I\u2019ve never seen before. If she just apologized and explained it so it made sense, I could at least have some solid ground underneath my feet to just build back from. I even threw her a bone and said was it because she was mad at me for leaving her alone for so long and not telling her I was smoking (even though by then I didn\u2019t get the text), she said she was mad but it had nothing to do with that. She said she has always been so nice and patient with me and said she has always been a faithful partner, and said that I should know those values about her (which is true). \n\nI would hate leaving 8 years behind over a half of a cigarette, but the hiding, then lying, then trying to blame me, then trying to confuse me, then trying to distract me, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll recover from that without understanding the situation. Like I said it\u2019s not the cigarette, if the same situation was repeated with her sneaking a pork chop, it would be the same. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this from her before, she\u2019s been wonderful to me otherwise (to my knowledge, who knows anymore).\n\nAm I wrong for feeling this way? Am I wrong for worrying I\u2019ll never recover from this?\n\nTL;DR - My fianc\u00e9 tried to hide smoking a cigarette from me. This totally goes against her character. She actively tried to hide it when I was around. She then tried to blame me and confuse me for the situation. Even after many conversations, the situation makes no sense to me. I don\u2019t know if I can trust her, especially because i tried to get to the bottom of this with her.

More info: my stepmother has been in my life for over 15 years, and I still live at home.\n\nMy stepmother doesn't yell at her often - maybe once every couple of months. I'm pretty sure it's normal for parents to yell, and especially when it doesn't happen that often it's probably not harmful at all, so I think I'm overreacting emotionally. But when I see my little sister crying and looking scared I get so mad. It's usually about her not cleaning up enough, or not listening or doing what she was asked, etc - she's a really good kid and never does anything rude or cruel or anything, but she's mentioned before that she doesn't think she's a good kid, she thinks she's inbetween good and bad.\n\nI never react in any way. I just silently fume for a while until I successfully distract myself. I don't think I've ever actually argued with my stepmother, and I'm really bad with confrontation, and everyone else in the house is fine with it (dad \\[50M\\], brother \\[18M\\]), so I just try and get over it. I also don't even know if there's any need for confrontation. And if I did say anything, all that would probably happen is that I'd become a bit of a pariah in the house for a while.\n\nI know this is such a small thing, and as I said it doesn't come up that often. It's just that when it does, it feels so frustrating and conflicting and also kind of lonely for me, and I'm stuck between the two extremes of 'you're bringing negativity and unecessary anger into a completely normal situation', and 'you're letting your little sister down emotionally by not doing anything'.\n\ntl;dr: Whenever my stepmother occasionally yells at my little sister I have trouble controlling the amount of anger I feel.\n\nWhat I need advice on is: why do I feel like this?

The guy comes over for the weekend to stay with us. We co-own two apartments on the same floor. She is very sure she does not want to leave the life she has created for herself. The thing is the guy is really socially awkward. When initially he came into her life I was very respectful and polite towards him. I was very excited and happy for my sister. She had finally started to move on from her past abusive relationships. I took steps/initiatives to have decent conversations with him (my sister told me to take initiative) while allowing them the time and space.\n\nOver the past 2 months, weekend have become very stressful for me particularly. I get very unwelcoming vibes from this guy and he makes me feel I am an intruder. However, I don\u2019t get these vibes from my sister. Based on her request, I joined them once for a lunch and dinner. The guy literally started picking up on my food choices. I felt bad, awkward and judged. My sister'\u2019s reason for this is he is like this. This is his personality. You learn to ignore. I ignored it for 2 months. But the guy just won\u2019t stop picking on me. She tells me he is stupid so learn to ignore the jerk.\n\nWhen my sister is not around he literally gives me death stares and there have been times I have told him hello and he did not even reply leave alone smiling or being courteous. I thought this was rude. There have been times when I am talking to my sister about a topic in front of him (anything from work related to neutral topics). This guy would just keep talking while we are having a conversation. He would deliberately do this when I start talking to my sister. She tells me he likes nitpicking on people. Infact, he loves it.\n\nI politely excuse myself from these situations. Last weekend, I was just going into the kitchen to put dishes in the dishwasher and planning on making myself some coffee. I went to ask my sister if she and he would like to have some. The guy literally tells her I came to check on them to see if they are making out. It felt really awkward and since then I told my sister this was a bit surprising. I politely asked her I would not be seeing her during the weekends. She could come over to my apartment whenever she felt like. She was not okay with it but respected my decision. I don\u2019t know how to handle this social situation. We co-own both the houses &amp; business and I have my pets who I love to spend time with. When I would go to that apartment to take my stuff or help with her with household chores, there is radio silence. My sister does not want me to leave but the guy gives me very negative vibes like I just should not be there. What should I do? My sister told me not to take permanent decisions on something that might be temporary. But it does not feel temporary to me.\n\nTL:DR - My sister/best friend is dating a socially awkward guy. He visits her every weekends. I get unwelcoming vibes, death stares from him when I am around. I have stopped going to my apartment because he nitpicks really badly on me.

Like, she was like acting like it didn't matter that he would disprove of it... which gave me this weird vibe of just... non respect. This was his room, his stuff, and she very specifically chose a time when he would be away at work. And so in that respect, I agreed with my son. He was right. I told my wife, that was wrong of you.

I don't want to tell people what it was like but basically it wasn't fun and my foster parents didn't care about me and I am a girl so some bad stuff happened.\n\nI now stay with my teacher, husband, and their two sons and life is getting better. I feel like I have somewhere to go and people to be with. They are all nice to me and the dad is teaching me how to drive, I bake and paint with my teacher who is also helping me with school because I really care about my grades and want to take advanced classes and get into a good college but I never felt supported before, and hang out with the sons. I was always the weird \"foster girl\" at school but the older son is in the grade above me and always sticks up for me and Im making more friends!\n\nI recently came into contact with my birth parents through a mutual acquaintance in our town (they live few towns over) who are still together now and have more kids. They wanted to meet me. I didn't want to meet them because they didn't want me and if they had not have had me, I wouldn't have to go to foster care.\n\nBut then I was doing some research and I realized that maybe I should meet them because I could get some information about medical history which is really important.\n\nSo I met them and they brought \"my siblings\" and I got really overwhelmed. I tried to think about how I am happy now but it didn't work and I told my birth parents I needed to speak to them and I ended up telling them all the things that happened to me in foster care and how no one wanted to be my friend or cared about me until this year.\n\nThey were really upset and apologized to me and told me that they gave me away because they thought I would have had a better life. They said they loved me and thought about me everyday and all the time. They offered to pay for therapy and said that they were sorry for missing 15 years of my life and wanted to be in my life if I let them. They said they have a bedroom for me and have had one as soon as they were able\n\nI am really overwhelmed. I am mad at them for giving me away. I don't want to leave my teacher but I don't want to intrude because I feel like a burden.\n\nBut I hate my real mom and dad. They are the reason I suffered about it. I see my siblings and I feel different. I feel like I don't belong and that they are lying that they love me because they missed all those years.\n\nDo I try and form a relationship with them?

She did it really suddenly and without much warning, letting me know about three weeks beforehand (and only after she told just about everyone else in her life). She kept saying that it was a decision she made for us because (for reasons I won\u2019t get into) we can\u2019t be seen in public together in Pennsylvania, where we live. The thing is, she never asked me about it beforehand, made the decision without my input, and expected me to drop everything to go live with her come January. The distance has been hard, and I was really hurt by how selfishly and suddenly she made this decision, but I really love her and want to marry her more than I\u2019ve ever wanted anything in my life, so I agreed. I went to visit her back in October for her birthday, and it was lovely. It was really nice getting to see her, and it made me all the more sure that I was ready to move in with her. Since that visit, however, she\u2019s been gradually getting more and more distant. When I first left, we would text whenever she got the chance at work and she would call me for at least 30 minutes every night before bed (and sometimes on her drive to/from work as well). Lately, she hasn\u2019t been texting me, and our nighttime phone calls have been 10 minutes if I\u2019m lucky, but usually less than five. I figured she was stressed out with work and adjusting, so I made sure to ask if she was okay, but never pressed the issue. As it got worse and worse, however, I began to wonder if it was an issue with me.\n\nToday, she called me on her drive home from work and was really distant and uninterested, as per the norm lately. I finally decided that it was time to ask her what was wrong, and she said she\u2019s been having doubts about me. She said she\u2019s been worried that I wouldn\u2019t be able to find a job in the area, and that I wouldn\u2019t make any friends and would just cling to her constantly. The thing is, I\u2019ve been job hunting in the area and will be able to easily find a job because of my experiences, and friends aren\u2019t a top priority to me because I\u2019m an introvert who very rarely needs people time. She then expressed that she hasn\u2019t been adjusting well to her move, and that work has been hard, and that she really likes where she\u2019s at and doesn\u2019t like the idea of her life changing. Long story short, she left me, and I was supposed to move in exactly one month (January 7th, which happens to be the day before our anniversary). She also said it would be best if we stopped talking, and that she would check in on me in two months. She said she still loves me and that I\u2019m good for her and make her happy, so I really don\u2019t understand why this happened.\n\nI really love her. I love her more than I\u2019ve ever loved anything, and she makes me the happiest man alive. I don\u2019t understand how this happened so suddenly, and how I\u2019m supposed to cope. I already bought all of her Christmas presents and packed most of my things. I don\u2019t get where things went wrong.

He wanted to have peace and wants to go on a spiritual journey on his own.\n\nFor a bit of context, my mom (44 F) and dad (married 22 years) were fighting for a few weeks because my dad wants to bring his mother (my paternal grandmother) to Australia for a visit as she has never been here since we moved.

I met this girl at the beginning of the summer when she started working where I worked. Long story short, we ended up talking to one another following some very serious drama and traumatic experiences (traumatic for her and I) between us &amp; other coworkers. The first time I hung out with her alone outside of work to get coffee, we had amazing chemistry. And for the next month of us talking we had a great time hanging out. Over that time period, we made lots of plans for what to do during the college semester, we saw a psychic, and she even let me sleep at her place for 3 days while my state was being rampaged by a hurricane. (Note: we never had sex cause she takes a long time with people, although we did almost kiss)\n\nNow, I understand us talking for a month is a bit long. For me, I didn't mind it so much since my ex and I took pretty long &amp; we had a great relationship. By the end of that month, I was ready to start trying to make things official. Every person I talked to felt like I had a great chance with her, because I was getting some very positive signs (aside from the flirting, good morning/good night messages, we got drunk at one point &amp; she made a very sexual joke lol...overall we just clicked well imo). Everything flowed so naturally with her. Things were looking good, and then after the time she let me spend with her during the hurricane it was like a switch turned off. She suddenly stopped giving any and all signs.\n\nHot -&gt; Cold over the course of a day.\n\nI eventually confronted her bc when she went cold it was around the same time I wanted things to advance further. I basically asked her \"where do we stand\" &amp; at that point she gave me this very ambiguous paragraph beating around the bush saying how the drama/trauma from other coworkers really took a toll on her &amp; atm she was \"just looking for a friend\" and \"wasn't sure if our relationship is meant to go further than it has\". Friends have given me mixed responses on that, saying she's letting off easy or she really is just looking for a friend rn. Both are very likely options.\n\nGetting led on for a month hurt like hell, and it's been 3 months later &amp; I'm still trying to recover. When I think about her and how things went, I get overcrowded with feelings of insecurity (\"was it something I did?\" \"is there something wrong with me\" \"is there something i did to trigger this hot-cold behavior?\"). It hurts how she doesn't even put in enough reciprocation/effort for a friendship, in my view. Especially after everything we've gone through\n\nSome more background/context on her: she took an attachment style test &amp; scored quite heavily on the anxious-avoidant side, her past relationships were all with toxic people (she's only been in 2 relationships and they were during high school), trust issues from toxic friends in hs, pretty bad daddy issues &amp; slight mommy issues, she's a self-admitted narcissist (for instance she once told me that she would only gift someone with a gift bc she wants them to feel honored to have received it from her). During our time at work, she was attracted to about 3 people at the same time and could not stick to one (she was seriously talking with two of them &amp; almost got into a relationship with one...then she didn't and started talking to me). She's told me that she will have very severe dissociative episodes or panic attacks fairly regularly. She has depressive symptoms and is dependent on weed to fall asleep. She has no real life goals at all. She just wants to leave the state we live in once she graduates college. She will never ask someone to hang out unless there is a clear goal behind it (for example the only times she put effort in to hang out with me was when we were trying to get back at another coworker we both disliked...). She's a very unclear communicator.\n\nMany people have told me that I dodged a bullet. I don't like to frame things that way, but I see how they have a point. She puts on a passive persona, but behind it she doesn't seem to care about anything at all unless it can provide something for her sense of status.\n\nI let her borrow a book I read recently about relationships, and I was surprised how everything in that book was applicable to her. I gave it to her not expecting things to change really, but because I want the best for her &amp; I don't want her to be trapped in the past. That being said, I sometimes wish things were different bc there are so many positive things about her.\n\nGoing forward though, I want to keep her out of my mind and my life. A month or two back, I was hanging out w her and a friend of ours &amp; she said \"Yeah right now relationships are too much effort\" And I feel like that tells me everything I need to know. I don't want to waste my time with someone who lacks a genuine interest &amp; compassion for people. And that statement just reveals herself as someone who is not ready atm for a relationship bc she lacks the capacity to put in that effort -&gt; emotionally unavailable\n\nAfter she gives me back my book, I've been trying to think if I should have a discussion with her. Would it be a good idea to discuss with her my thoughts about all of this or should I just drop it &amp; leave her be until she actually wants to put in effort. She'll likely project/assume that I'm not interested in being connected to her if I completely drop her, so what would be better? I think one lesson she can learn is the value of clear communication &amp; being upfront about things, so that's why I was thinking that I should tell her my thoughts on her nonsense lol.

I was 18 and he was 23 when we first started dating. 5.5 year gap. He just moved across the country to my state when we started dating. We\u2019ve lived together for 2.5 years. He is very successful and I didn\u2019t need to go to college or get a job anywhere else besides his business. (i hated school my whole life and never planned to go to college but sometimes i feel like i want to have my own career) Everything is great and we get along so well, for the most part. We get into stupid fights here and there. Our main argument was that he lied to me about his past, which is so stupid because the past is in the past for a reason. But i just feel disrespected because he lied for years about women that he\u2019s been with, which i found out later he was lying about. \nAbout 6 months ago we had a horrible fight and I decided enough was enough. I\u2019m 20 at this point and packed everything in a duffel bag and went to my parents. That night he wasn\u2019t feeling good and went to the ER. I felt horrible and I met him at the ER. He was diagnosed with stage 4 testicular cancer.. \nI felt trapped at first.\nI went back to our house after the ER and have taken care of him every single day.

(If that\u2019s the case I think i should go to therapy and work on myself) She calls every single day and will text him every day needing to know where he is and what\u2019s he doing. Also sends so many kissing and heart emojis. Maybe i\u2019m just jealous once again and need some  help. But that\u2019s my question.. Should i stay with him and suggest couples therapy since i still deep down love him so much? Or should i work on myself?

During our first date, he told me he had an online stalker and hadn\u2019t figured out what or who was harassing him. Me not thinking I was going to continue the relationship, brushed it off and said that everyone must encounter a crazy person once in their lives\u2026 I quickly got attached to this guy after a few weeks (I also have an anxious attachment style). Before I could even get to know the guy. I fell for him and we were inseparable. Then the harassment started. The stalker, started messaging me and telling me that he is horrible and is an alcoholic. Treats women like shit, cheats, is lazy, etc. I brushed it off thinking that it was an ex. He told me that he didn\u2019t know who it was. I was always skeptical, but ignored it. I was not fully using my logical brain and continued the relationship. Online harassment became my daily life. She escalated from warning me, to insulting me and saying horrible things about my appearance. She reached out to my friends, coworkers and family. I broke up with the guy about 3 times. I was conflicted and didn\u2019t know what to do. Many other things happened during our relationship. He\u2019s an avoidant partner. 9 or so months later. His drinking got bad. I knew it was time to walk away. He ended up being aggressive and messaging many mean things. Finally after 2 months of still messaging him, calling him, and seeing him after I \u201cended it,\u201d I finally did end it. The stalker was gone for awhile during the relationship.. recently she has reappeared. About 2 weeks ago she messaged me telling me that she was right and he has been cheating since day one. During this time, he also went back to seeing someone he has known for 8 year. She treats him like a baby and he likes it but uses her because he doesn\u2019t see a relationship with her. And I guess she likes to be used and needed. So I can\u2019t help but think that his friend/fuck buddy is involved and she has been behind the screen all along. He denied it of course. \n\nTL;DR!

I observed my friend 40'sF being rude to the new person. She would \"correct\" the new friend, even when the new friend was right. She was always critical, but at least it was refreshing to see that the problem is with my friend 40F and not me. \n\nAdditionally on one of those outings she took us to a place I had already been. Beforehand she repeatedly ignored when I talked about my prior experiences and then kept saying that she will love to hear our impressions of the place after she takes us there. (Like, what? You aren't introducing me to a place I've been.) \n\nBefore we left she also tried to get me to park in the spot at get condo that she was vacating. It's a long story but she is fighting with her neighbor about the spot and I even drove her to the police station one time, at her request, due to this neighbor's behavior. When I refused to park in that disputed spot, she rolled her eyes and made a remark to the third person/new friend implying that I was being silly. That to me was even more toxic than her past behavior.\n\nIt took me a while to acknowledge the problematic behavior, I think mainly because I got along with her so well in other ways. Also, this behavior didn't really appear in our friendship until she broke up with a past boyfriend. Now I understand the situation clearly and I have basically just been fading slowly out of her life. I genuinely wish her the best. I'm also enjoying life even more now, even with a hole in my social activities. It's nice not being around someone who's trying to diminish my experiences and knowledge to make themselves feel better. \n\nTo all of those who offered genuine advice on how to handle the bad behavior from my friend, thank you!! \n\nTLDR: I observed the same behavior out of my friend from a third party perspective that I described towards me.

However, he was starting to return back to his old ways by taking days to respond.\n\nHe continued to do this, and I was starting to get the idea that he wasn\u2019t interested in me anymore. He was still asking me to hang out, however, so I thought he was still interested. Last week, he asked me if I was doing anything, and I said he could come over on a Friday. It had been 6 hours since I sent that message, and when I checked my Instagram, I saw that he had posted without responding, which was the breaking point for me honestly.\n\nI ended up blocking him on iMessage because I was officially done with the lack of communication.

I appreciate all the advice. I will seek out a therapist to get through this as it is indeed a painful moment in my life. I guess deep down I know none of this was a good idea but maybe I was \"*shock by her admission and further fricking audacious actions*\" coupled with the reality of the last 5 years of building, traveling, fun &amp; happy times, and my once best friend in life and first true love all coming to an end. I am definitely allowing my emotions to hold me hostage here. The friendship obviously would not benefit me in any resourceful way but I can see how it would benefit her in many ways. A *security blanket as* someone put it.\n\nI also agree that at this point I cannot dictate who she sees or befriends. Knowing that she still wanted some kind of relationship with the guy that she cheated on me with I should have simply declined the mere notion of us being friends.\n\n**TO THOSE SEEKING MORE DETAILS.**\n\nNo we don't have kids.\n\nI have pressed her on the \"met at a store\" story several times but she doubles down on it. Says she understands that the behavior was unsafe and unhealthy but she was in a vulnerable place - due to the marital funk - when she first met the guy and accepted his number and his request to have drinks. Also blames some of her actions on alcohol.\n\nThis woman came into my life when I was in a dark place myself. She is a big reason why I am the person I am today as she's helped build me up in many ways. So it seems to me that one of the reasons why I still wanted to be there for her after what happened was probably to show gratitude. As some has pointed out it probably has to do with not having better self-esteem as well. I'm also aware that she can have suicidal thoughts and speak in really dark terms when she goes through situations like this and she has during this process especially when she thought she was going to be homeless, etc. But I am coming to the realization that the same way I must now seek help to better myself, so does she. She cannot expect me to care more for her than she does for herself. Especially in a moment like this I must prioritize myself and my mental health if I am to move past this.\n\nThroughout the years we've had some marital issues. Typically in the form of verbal abuse on both ends. When arguments occur, some pretty horrible things get said both by me and by her. We tried to change this but it didn't seem to be working out. She claims that this is what drove her to do what she did. The \"*break*\" in question was not a separation. We were having discussions on whether we should call it quits or not after our last big fight. She then said that she needs space for herself and this is when she went out of town for a couple days. She even asked me to join her on the first day/night which I did. The next day is when the situation happened with the 'stranger'.\n\nI still cannot make sense of all of it. Some of it definitely seems made up and like she's lying. Others just seem like pretty irrational behavior of which she's blaming on things that I've said in arguments. Whether it was planned or not. OR done out of anger it's blatantly disrespectful no matter how you look at it. If we were to end things. Fine, let's do that first then pursue your rendezvous.\n\nAs much as it still hurts and as painful as all of this is, I am now filing for divorce, I stopped all contact with her (*except for how to distribute our assets*), and I'll be getting a therapist.\n\nThank you for your time, words, encouragement and advice.

Nothing to brag home about, but no debt, something invested for retirement and a good enough income ($60k). With my GF, we have been discussing marriage lately and for me finances are a big factor in this type of decision/commitment.\n\nShe is okay with money, and doesn't really spend above her means. Some past ill advice investments (before we even met) caused her to go in a bit of CC debt (nothing outrageous, ballpark $4-5k). The problem is that her income, despite being stable, is not very high ($35k), and that coupled with high interest on such debt, makes repaying that debt very slow.\n\nWe live together, and we contribute to our expenses proportionally to our incomes. We also live in a very HCOL city, which doesn't help\n\nNow, if the debt is still there once we get married, I will cover it right away. Again, I could afford $5k, but it would not be a mindless thing to do for me, as it would still be a good % of my savings. But I will do it as that debt will become mine and I know better than keep it growing.\n\nHowever, I think that it would be a good teaching moment for her if I was able to educate her a bit more about how to deal with CC debt, so that hopefully this doesn't happen again in the future.\n\nI looked into balance transferring this debt to some 18-month 0% APR intro CC, to make it easier for her to keep up with the interest. We have a joint account at BofA, and I think it should be easy enough to open a BankAmericard, for this purpose - just to make an example.-\n\nDo you guys have any suggestion about the best strategy to help her (and me at the same time)?

He writes text and emails like he\u2019s paying per character. He\u2019s always been like this, it\u2019s basically a family joke, I\u2019ve seen letters he wrote from camp as a kid.\n\nHe travels often for work, and I conveyed early and often in our relationship that I needed more from him than a text like \"can u pick me up \uff20jfk\uff202 tmrw or cab?\u201d I need something closer to \u201cHey sweetie can\u2019t wait to see you, my flight lands at 2 tomorrow, flight #DL999 fyi, let me know if you can pick me up at JFK or I\u2019ll book a cab, I love you and can\u2019t wait to see you and the boys after three weeks away &lt;3\u201d He\u2019s definitely made a conscious effort to get better at it, so maybe the text will be something like \u201chey sweetie - can you pick me can you pick me up at jfk\uff202 tmrw or cab? &lt;3 miss you 4.\" Every so often I'll say something or have a longer conversation with him but for most part I've just accepted it and learned to \"translate.\"\n\nBefore my husband and I met, he was married to this woman named Sarah for two years. He made no secret to me of his deep love for Sarah for their entire marriage, but would admit that she was \u201chigh strung\u201d (read: a self-centered emotionally turbulent semi-narcissist who had an affair with one of his best friends for most of their marriage). That being said he did love her and in her own way I\u2019m sure she loved him. She died after a sudden medical issue in 2010.\n\nI was doing closet cleaning and pulled out a memory box he has of a few of Sarah's things. It\u2019s not a secret box, he\u2019s shown me the contents before, but for the first time I actually opened this little folded paper and it was this very long and effusive note to her that he wrote early in their marriage.\n\nIt's not like he doesn't say those kind of things in private but the letter was very shout-from-the-rooftops-how-much-I-love-you. This is the same man who, I swear to god, once gave me a a gorgeous $500 necklace accompanied by a post-it note saying \"2 the woman I love.\" And I put that post-it note on my mirror too.\n\nPart of me wants to confront him, part of me feels guilty for opening the letter, part of me feels insecure that he can't be bothered to do that for me even though he knows it's something I do value. And then part of me feels sort of alienated from him because it's just so hard to imagine the man I know writing these words and it makes me wonder who exactly he was when he was with her. And part of me wonders if he felt like he had to write that kind of thing for Sarah and that that's why he has a hard time taking feedback now.\n\nI don't like to dredge up Sarah without him initiating, not after 12 years, and his communication style is one of those fights we've had multiple times. It's two very sensitive subjects rolled into one. I'm close to his mom and his brother, and I've talked to each of them about Sarah before because they both have their own takes on his first marriage, but that also feels a little like a betrayal.\n\n**TL;DR: My husband is a notoriously brief unsentimental written communicator even after multiple conversations about it.

I graduate college in May and he keeps casually bringing up me to moving  in with him frequently. Also, his mom has encouraged it a few times too. He graduated last year and has a great apartment in an amazing location that would be really beneficial for me to start my career in . We\u2019ve been an hour and a half away while I finish school and miss each other so much. If I don\u2019t move in we\u2019ll still be an hour apart and only have weekends together. I love the idea of living together but there are a few things making me hesitant, all of which have to do with me and not my boyfriend. Finances, my family situation, and trauma from my last serious relationship. \n\nI don\u2019t really know where to start because there\u2019s a lot that goes into this so bear with me.\n\nFor starters, I have a lot of student loan debt that I want to seriously pay off as soon as possible and unfortunately I know I won\u2019t be making more than 40,000-50,000 starting off. He has no debt and makes close to 70k with no experience right out of college so I don\u2019t think he can really understand the gravity of that. I\u2019ve expressed this concern to him, and he says he already pays the full rent alone so I wouldn\u2019t have to contribute if I can\u2019t, but that doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I feel guilty even if I help with utilities and other household chores. His rent is around  $2,000 a month and paying half of that is not in my budget. Due to my family situation, I am very weary about depending on anybody other than myself and fear that if anything were to happen I wouldn\u2019t have enough saved to take care of myself and be stuck in a pretty shitty home situation. \n\n\nMy parents are divorced and when I\u2019m not living at my school apartment my moms house is my main residence. My mom and I have some very fundamental differences and tend to not get along super well. Within the past couple of years, my siblings and I have noticed concerning changes in my mom. We think she is suffering from breast implant Illness and treating her symptoms with serious medication rather than getting them removed. This has led to some behavior that resembles addiction (although we don\u2019t think she\u2019s popping pills to get high intentionally) but essentially she is not herself and has become miserable to live with. My older sister who still lives at home calls me constantly to complain about her irrational, narcissistic , and crazy behavior. My mom has slowly become unrecognizable but she dismisses our concerns, gets defensive, and says it\u2019s her house so she can do whatever she wants. My step dad is too weak to stand up to her, possibly because she is the main provider for the household. So although I was planning to move home after college and aggressively pay off my debt, I will suffer mentally living there and barely get to be with my boyfriend. \n\n\nOn top of this, my mom is the main provider of that house and was really successful making six figures for a while, until she recently took a pay cut at a new job to decrease her work stress, but still makes decent money. However, it is BAFFLING how financially irresponsible she is. She has actually asked her 20 year old children for money on numerous occasions. \u201cDo you have $200 I can pay you back Friday\u201d \u201cdo you have any cash I can venmo you later\u201d\u2026 what kind of adult doesn\u2019t have $200 to use in a pinch???  This has always stressed me out immensely. On the flip side, when we have been in a rough situation she has offered financial support, but I think she often asked my dad for the money then gave it to us and then threw it back in our faces and uses it to manipulate. Because of this, I have been working very hard to be completely Independent from my parents and only depend on myself. Since I\u2019ve been 18 I\u2019ve paid everything myself from car insurance, utilities, rent while being a full-time student despite her receiving $800 in child support a month  up until last year. I have no idea where that money has gone, but can assume it was spent on expensive skin care, shoes, makeup etc.  My dad is willing to help when necessary but he is not quick to give handouts despite being a well-off engineer. He\u2019s pretty checked out. This situation has led me to be very hyper independent which is why the thought of not contributing to rent and the possibility of that being held over my head or resented makes me so anxious. \n\nLastly, when I was 16 my boyfriend of a year hid severe mental health issues and a crippling Xanax addiction from me for months. Despite being together everyday, I was deceived and lied to so much I had no idea until my debit card was stolen and used at ATMS around town. The funny part is his family has crazy generational wealth, and as explained above I definitely did not and worked for every penny I had. I put so much into helping him and was definitely emotionally abused for about 3 years. I have a lot of trauma from that relationship that I brushed off and never really worked through. The day after he abruptly got sent to a no contact wilderness program I went back to school because I was in all AP and honors classes maintaining a 4.3 GPA and had sports practice. I had no time to process what happened and as a result I have a lot of walls up. Things went south so fast and i watched someone I love change so much that I have trust issues. \n\nThough my current boyfriend is very different, having seen someone change so drastically I can\u2019t help but worry that I could get burned badly again and then be stuck in my toxic household and heartbroken. My boyfriend is the most caring, thoughtful, loving person. I know now he would do anything to make me happy and be together, but I\u2019m scared of change, the unknown, and how my finances could be affected. I wish I could jump right in and start our life together. He\u2019s always talking about our future whether it be places he wants to go together, where we could move to eventually, getting married. I love how certain he is and as much as it makes me happy to think about all of that with him, everything I\u2019ve known is so different from this perfect idea of what we could be and my logical side doesn\u2019t want to let my guard down and get my hopes up. \n\nTL/DR: My boyfriend and our relationship is amazing but my finances, family problems, and past relationship trauma make me hesitant to make me hesitant to move in.", "title": "My boyfriend (23M) wants me (21F) to move in after I graduate but I can\u2019t afford to help with rent."}, {"created_utc": 1642083283, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s30e37/one_day_were_obsessed_with_each_other_next_day_he/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "One day we\u2019re obsessed with each other, next day he completely vanished.

I\u2019m also aware this could easily be grass is greener syndrome, but it feels like an itch.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do about it; granted, it could be magnified since my girlfriend and I have been in separate countries catching up with friends and enjoying the holidays for the last six weeks or so. I just don\u2019t know how to resolve guilt and love with intrigue and yearning.

As time went on he became increasingly more addicted to his phone. To the point of having cheated on me in the past, not because he didn\u2019t want ME, but because he didn\u2019t want to get off the computer. He\u2019d rather have some girl send photos than be with a living human, because he could game at the same time. \n\nWe broke up for a long time, got couples counseling, and I thought we\u2019d worked through this. He was gaming a normal amount (a couple hours a day) and had given up the more time consuming text based and social games. \n\nBut since starting his new job, he\u2019s gone back to it. I\u2019ve done a lot of work to get past the character designs (he plays games with pretty offensive ones) but I can\u2019t get past everything else. He\u2019s gaming literally all night. This is not an exaggeration. He comes home from work, plops in front of the computer, and sits there until 5, 6am. The people he\u2019s gaming with, he sees them as real friends but I don\u2019t think real friends would encourage this kind of behaviour. He looks like a drug addict. He\u2019s surviving on energy drinks. Forgetting to eat. Forgetting to sleep. Cleans nothing. Cooks nothing. Tries to convince me he\u2019s doing chores so he can spend more time gaming. Like he\u2019ll say he\u2019s going to do the dishes and I\u2019ll go in the kitchen to find him sitting on the floor, hunched over his phone. Twice this week, he burned food that way. \n\nI know it sounds like a cliche but I\u2019ve started noticing other guys because we literally never have sex. If I wake up in the morning wanting it, he\u2019s passed out and can\u2019t wake up until 20 minutes before his shift starts because he was gaming all night. If I want it at night, forget it, the computer is too important. \n\nIf I ask him to complete a task on the computer for our business he\u2019ll get around to it. \n\nThe last time this happened, he got bad enough to drop close to $500 on in game merch without thinking and we almost became homeless, hence the very long breakup. \n\nI kinda ignored it because he was working but this whole week he\u2019s been off and instead of spending his usual work hours with me it\u2019s just 24/7 gaming. But if I want help with the chores or to spend time with him he\u2019s \u201ctoo sick\u201d. The only time he wants to spend time with me (or at least fakes it) is when he can clearly see that I\u2019m working and don\u2019t have time to talk. It\u2019s like he\u2019s just trying to fake wanting to engage. \n\nAny other video game widows in the Reddit verse? Is it even worth trying to repair, or should I just let him go?

This will be a little complicated but I'm in a bit of a rush so I'll try to make it simple.\n\nMy (29F) niece (21F) and I have always been close. Her mom sort of left her in the care of my parents while she was off doing whatever, so she's sort of like my little sister. Things have quickly gone downhill, though.\n\nAfter my mom died a few years ago, I gave my niece the option to move in with me since I was getting divorced and needed a new roommate. She was super excited and grateful. \n\nFor more context, I have always been taking chances on her. When she graduated high school and wanted to go to college, I recognized her struggle and contributed to get her a new laptop. However, she dropped out the next semester for reasons I don't really know. I also gave her money for her birthday to specifically buy a Nintendo Switch (because I couldn't find one available at the time) and she did not buy it, but used the money for other reasons.\n\nAnyway, she moved in, and things went downhill pretty quickly. She was late on rent consistently. We got into a fight because she wanted me to buy her vape stuff, and after several times of saying yes, I finally said no because 1) I was uncomfortable doing so and 2) I didn't really like making time in my schedule to do that. She got very, very upset with me. \n\nThere was also a situation with her recent-ish boyfriend, but I don't feel like going super into it. Basically, I don't really trust him, and when he came to visit, I'm pretty sure they were doing drugs, etc. I also think he love bombed her (he's a soundcloud rapper lol and he got her an Apple Watch within months of dating). Despite being on my lease, she informed me that she was moving out. Luckily, a new partner was moving in, so I wasn't totally out of luck, but she said that she would continue to pay a portion of the rent when she moved since she didn't want to deal with breaking the lease. I tried to get her out of the lease, but she was very adamant about staying on. We got into a fight over her leaving her stuff there. But when she moved, it was on decent terms.\n\nWe haven't talked very much since as the tension is still definitely there, and it's usually to borrow money or ask favors. Well, she asked for one today. She asked for money to cover rent. She said she's getting paid today or tomorrow, but her bf's mom needs the money tomorrow morning or else she'll kick them out. I obviously don't know his mom but I find it hard to believe that she would kick them out if she didn't get it within a day. I also feel like, if she couldn't save $200 for rent... \n\nI'm nervous because I don't want her to think she can take advantage of me like she has done before. I'm trying to set boundaries but I am also nervous because they know where I live, and I am a little fearful of her bf.\n\nI suppose I'm just looking for advice about what to do/how to say it/etc. I think I am going to say no, I don't have the funds for it right now, as I don't want to start a fight over not believing her, etc.\n\nTLDR: Issues with my niece and money have been consistent.

I went from being a bridesmaid to being not invited at all. When I asked who was invited she said \"family and close friends.\" \n\nAs far as I'm aware, there are people coming from out of state (she lives across the country), I'm vaccinated, I'm of the same culture, she's told me several times one of which was in person, her family likes me (or is ok with me - as far as I know), and we had no falling outs recently. \n\nIt came to me as a shock that she would uninvite me from her wedding as I didn't see this coming because I had no reason to.

When we were 22, we had somewhat of a falling out because she had a lot of pent up aggression she took out on me. She was being super passive aggressive and instead of telling me something bothered her, would say nothing did and then be angry at me until she exploded. I felt like I was walking on eggshells and cried a lot, it was a super horrible feeling. She would also come visit other friends and not invite me and I didn't understand why. I thought it was because she wanted to spend time with them, but now I think it's because she just didn't want to see me. I just don't understand why she wanted to be friends with me still. \n\nShe sent me a Christmas gift last year after I gave her a few gifts in a row. It was honestly very nice of her. I'm just super confused at where our friendship stands. On one hand she acts like we are close, but on the other hand, she doesn't do anything a close friend does.

TL;DR is at the bottom.\n\nI was going to post this last week however Dan messaged me saying he needs a bit more time and that work has been really demanding with the project he's working on and that we should talk about whats happened on Saturday. \n\nThis might be long so please bear with me. Me and my Fiance, Dan, have been together for nearly 5 years and I can say that he is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. We met at a graduate program and we hit it off really quickly and I found myself falling for him pretty quickly. About 3 months into us talking I brought up the idea of us dating and he was really hesitant about it, after a long conversation I found out that he had never been in a relationship before and had, as he said, \"a woeful lack of experience with women in a romantic and sexual sense\" so we decided to take things slow.  We didn't even kiss until about 3 months of us dating because he had never kissed a girl before and wanted it to be meaningfull. \n\nWhen it came to sex there were some issues at the start; mainly anxiety of not being good, worries about his size and the key one, in his eyes, me comparing him to other guys I've had sex with. This brought up the conversation of my sexual experience, I admittedly hid some things here, and told him I had been with 4 people (3 relationships, 1 hook-up). In reality my number was 10 (3 relationships, 6 hook-ups,  1 FWB). We were able to talk through his insecurities and he became more confident in the fact that I loved him and was able to work past the gap in experience he had. About a year into our relationship he brought up expanding the things we did in the bedroom, initially I was really happy about this becuase I saw it as him giving me more of himself if that makes sense? But half-way through the conversation, I don't know what happened it was like a flip switched in my head and I thought that if I let him do these things with me he'd see me as less than I was before. The things he bought up were; Anal, a FFM threesome ( right after he said that he made it explicitly clear he did not expect anything and likened it to \"riding a dinosaur. Fun in theory but probably gonna end pretty bad.\") and Light BDSM (Blindfold, fuzzy handcuffs).\n\nI had done these before with the FWB Jake because I wanted to explore my sexuality and though I had fun when we did them I realised that I did them to keep Jake around. This is where I fucked up. I told him that I had never done these things and had no interest in doing them. After the conversation he didn't talk to me for a few days. I messaged him and asked if we were still together and he said we were and he just wanted to bring up these fantasies to get them off his chest and if I didn't want to do them he doesn't care as he loves me and is happy with how our sex life was now. I don't know why I lied about not doing them but I didn't feel as if I needed to do these with Dan because we were both happy in our relationship and I didn't want to jeporadize that.\n\nFor new years we went to one of my old university friends party as I hadn't seen them because of the pandemic. Dan wasn't really interested with doing anything because his work project was taking up most of his time and he wanted to get some work done on Sunday to help out the team. I ended up dragging him along because I wanted to celebrate with him and thought it would be nice for him to see everyone considering we hadn't really had a social event since his birthday in July. When we got there I saw Jake and realised I fucked up by not telling Dan the truth. He had met 2 of my exes and the guy I had a hook-up with, at first he was a bit antsy but he dealt with it very easily and was able to have normal conversations with them. I never told him about Jake becuase, quite frankly, it had nothing to do with him and it wasn't a concern for our relationship. \n\nSo for most of the night it was great I was able to talk to my friends and catch up and so did Dan until about 11pm where the guys and girls split into two groups. The guys were in the back on the deck and me and the rest of the girls were in the house with the kitchen being the mixing ground so to speak. With the countdown happening in about 30 mins I went to get Dan so we could count in the new years together but he wasnt there. I asked the guys and they said that him and Jake went to the front to smoke (I found that weird because Dan doesn't smoke unless its with me). I got to the front and saw them talking and laughing and I eased up and asked Dan to come in and he did but from then on he seemed abit off? Like he wasn't fully there. The countdown goes well and we kiss but again it felt as if he was just going through with it because I wanted him to. I originally chalked it to the alchohol and him smoking alongside him being tired from work. \n\nWhen we got back to his I expected us to have sex but he said he was tired and just wanted to sleep. I felt abit annoyed but understood and we went to sleep. On Sunday he got a message from his Grandmother saying some of his cousins are here and he should see them so he made breakfast for us I went back to my appartment to get ready for work and he went to see his family. At about 3pm he messaged me saying he needs some time alone, I said that was all good thinking he was getting into his work and was focusing on getting it done. 5 days go by and he hadn't messaged me once and I put the pieces together about him and Jake going for a \"smoke\" and asked him if he was alright. He deflected saying he was fine and work was just taking up his time. I knew he was lying and asked him what him and Jake were talking about he said he doesn't want to have this conversation now or over text and he would see me soon. Since then there has been no messages untill yesterday when he messaged me saying that we should talk on Saturday if I was free. I know what this is about and I'm scared that he's going to break off the engagement with me because of Jake.\n\nPlease I need help on what to say/do.

So the title pretty much speaks for itself. I would like to give a bit more information, though. I (F16) am in a relationship with M18 and we have been dating for 1,5 years I think. Maybe a bit longer. My boyfriend is diagnosed with autism when he was younger and he does struggle a bit in relationships. We have a good, comfortable and trustworthy relationship. I love him a lot and he makes me laugh a lot and I am happy when I am with him. I am however diagnosed with BPD, GAD and ADHD. These diagnoses were officially \u2018given\u2019 to me about 1 month ago. But before this I had DBT and other therapies and I still speak once a week with a therapist. \n\nMy mental health has been really unstable since I was young and I have an intense fear of abandonment. It used to be things like crying when my mom was not home, constantly calling my grandmother and always wanting to hang out with friends. I would get insecure when these things didn\u2019t happen, scared they were gone. But it got better when I was 14. \n\nNow I am 16 and in a relationship and I do struggle with being clingy and also needy. Some examples: when I am with my boyfriend I always want physical touch (cuddling, kisses or holding hands) and I get sad when he wants to let go to do something. I also \u2018I love you\u2019 quite often to the point he gets a bit uncomfortable. And when I text something important to me and he doesn\u2019t text back immediately I start calling his phone. I also randomly get him expensive gifts out of no where that make him a bit uncomfortable because he\u2019s not able to return these gestures. These are some things I do and I am not proud of them because I am aware that my boyfriend gets annoyed or overwhelmed by my constant neediness. \n\nI have improved with texting. I no longer text constantly through out the day and even wait to reply to him some times. I also try to talk more in person as well. But it does get to me when we haven\u2019t spoken for a few hours and I get upset a bit (to myself not towards him.)\n\nBut I really want to learn how to stop constantly be with so physical with him, telling \u2018I love you\u2019 aaaall the time and to stop making these big gestures that CLEARLY make him uncomfortable. How do I improve this, but not come across as cold blooded? How can I show him I love him without all this? \n\nAdvice is really welcome!\n\nPs: I do have a life outside my boyfriend.

So far we've been successful and haven't gotten sick. \n\nOur social life has been at a minimum and this has taken a real toll on our relationship, but also on my partner's mental health, since he's an expat in my country and feels particularly lonely. Before Omicron hit, we planned to join a gym and start meeting friends more often. It is so incredibly draining to keep being this careful - we only wear FFP2 masks, we do PCR and fast tests to make sure we're not sick and we cancel plans again and again just to avoid exposure. \n\nBut now Omicron is on a rampage and even though me and my partner got boosted, my mom is refusing to even talk about it.

My sister's baby is the only grandchild my mom has, so obviously a lot of attention was on her. I don't voluntarily have any children, but like others' well enough.  My niece is cute as a button. My sister had made a calendar of her kid as a gift to us all. It featured pics of my niece in cute little outfits with matching backgrounds, like midsummer festival or easter witch or whatever. It was obvious my sister was proud of her work staging the pictures and we all oohhed and awwed in response.\n\nExcept my other sister's partner (let's call him Simon from now on).  He just flipped through the calendar as fast as he could in stony silence, then threw his in a pile somewhere. I thought it was rude then but didn't think about it much. We continued exchanging gifts, and when everything had been shared and opened, Simon piped up: \"Nothing for the other grandkids then?\" Everyone was confused. Simon clarified that he meant the dogs. (He has three dogs he dotes on. I have one. We talk about the dogs occasionally, but since my mom is allergic they aren't usually present when we meet. Simon is really proud of his dogs (they do agility and people search) and talks about them like they are his kids. He refers to my dog as my son as well. I hate it.)\n\nWell, Simon thought my mom should've gotten all the dogs gifts as well. My mom apologized and said she forgot. I said I didn't mind, my dog is not a child and has no concept of Christmas and was just happy he got an extra treat from me and an extra long walk. Simon made a mock-shocked face and told us their dogs deserved presents just like the niece, because they were the first \"grandkids\". Mom promised to get their dogs gifts and we kinda awkwardly dropped the conversation.\n\nWell, Simon called me after Christmas. He had thought about it, and said he wanted to do a calendar for next year as well, with both his and my dogs in it, dressed in costumes just like my niece. He also wants us to be in it on the last page, dressed in \"dog mom\" and \"dog dad\" shirts. He was super excited, and said that he's already talking to a photographer friend about it, to make it look \"really professional\". I said it didn't sound like my thing but he's been pushing it for two weeks now, sending me \"inspiration\" pics and telling me I should be proud of being a dog mom. He also asked when my dog's birthday is and wether I was going to have a party for it. Simon's always been a dog lover, but it's like my niece existing has unlocked a new, terrible phase in him.\n\nI don't want to do this. I love my dog, but he isn't a kid, and I cringe when Simon describes me as my dog's mom. I don't want to give my (allergic, has not met my dog!) mom a calendar of my dog.

I just couldn\u2019t get enough of him. I wanted to be around him all the time and the sex just lit me on fire. Emotionally we got vulnerable and close very fast and that just kept growing. We were both going through dramatic life changes at the time and we clung to each other to stay afloat. When life started to stabilise we got even closer but unfortunately it didn\u2019t last long, and his growing alcoholism eventually won out. He became less of my rock and more my earthquake and the intermittent neglect and coldness took a massive toll on my sense of security, identity and self worth. The good parts were life changing &amp; I wouldn\u2019t take any of it back, but unfortunately the bad side has left me with a decent bit of trauma around intimacy and love.\n\nLate 2020 I first tried to end things with my ex and met \u201cJosh\u201d not long after. I liked him a lot, but I just wasn\u2019t ready. At the time, Josh was in a bit of a vulnerable place himself so got attached to me quite quick. I decided that my hot and cold, emotionally unavailable bs was entirely unfair on him so I ended things. Got back with my ex not long after, but I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Josh &amp; wondering what would have happened. Unsurprisingly things with the ex just got worse so in late last year we split for good.\n\nDespite how rough that time was, a few months later my self esteem and happiness had recovered incredibly fast. To my total surprise, Josh (who had initially unfollowed me off everything when we stopped seeing each other) randomly reached out to me mid December. We started talking again and wow - it\u2019s such a difference from before. We are both in a much more stable, happy and (relatively) emotionally healthy place. These past few months we\u2019ve been seeing each other about 1-2 times a week and getting along very well &amp; we are incredibly similar people.\n\nThing is, I\u2019m significantly less attached to Josh than I was with my ex, even in the beginning. I\u2019m used to butterflies and daydreams. With Josh, it\u2019s significantly more relaxed. There\u2019s no crush feelings, I like him, I enjoy spending time with him and I\u2019d miss him if he decided to move to Africa tomorrow - but I\u2019d probably get over it in a week. I think I\u2019m subconsciously quite guarded, and I have a feeling he might be a little guarded too (unsurprising since I turned him down before lol). I don\u2019t really feel much intimacy or closeness with him, like really I guess I just don\u2019t know him that well, and we haven\u2019t really reached that deeper level yet. On the sex side, anatomically we\u2019re A++ compatible and he\u2019s much more enthusiastic about experimenting than my ex was. I really enjoy having sex with him, it\u2019s very very fun - but I\u2019m not feeling lust. I\u2019d just as happily not have sex with him too.\n\nI guess after being with my ex for so long and so intensely, being with someone new is probably going to take some time getting used to. Even tho I\u2019m definitely ready for dating now, I\u2019m of course still recovering from the damage and I think I will be for a while. Luckily I\u2019m not feeling anxious about it or anything - totally happy to just see where this goes, whether we become something more or just friends with benefits all is good to me!\n\nI guess this whole experience just has me curious cuz I have no idea what a healthy relationship looks like - I have nothing to compare to at all. Might sound like a silly question but the whole slow relo thing is such a foreign concept to me.

I study Mechanical Engineering at university and she studies Arts at hers. Through the duration of our relationship I have been flying interstate to see her for on average 4-5 days at a time. Now is the time where we have both been discussing me moving down to her city. However, because we have both never moved out of home and still live with our parents, it's hard to see how we would both be living together.\n\nI have seen a few issues in the relationship that I could see being an issue long term.\n\n- She has an eating disorder. She will eat loads of fast food one day, throws it up, says she'll never want to eat that type of food again, goes a few days without and then ends up eating it again. She refuses to seek professional help as she believes \u201cchange comes from within\u201d.\n\n- She has depression. Some days she will be happy and want to do so much and she also talks about her goals in life. And then something will trigger her and she will feel like shit and wants to give up. She also says things like \"What do I have to look forward in life?\" It makes me very sad watching her go through this and does bring me down a bit when she says \u201cYou have nothing to worry about\u201d.\n\n- She isn't good with money. Every time I come down to visit her she always gets Uber Eats even if the food place is an easy 10-15 min walk. I find this an issue because she says she wants to rent, yet spends all of her money on food, clothes and fuel so the two ideas are really conflicting. I also feel like the depression affects this as she says things like \"I'm in my self-destructive mood so I need to do this\". Because of this she doesn't have a lot of savings (Under $5k) even though she has always lived with her parents where she has access to food and doesn't have to pay rent. She has also said that she wants to potentially get a mortgage on a $300k apartment by telling the bank she has a full time job and then quitting that job so she can make money through selling second hand clothing online.\n\n- We haven't had PIV sex. This is a weird one because we are both virgins and for the first 6 months of our relationship she didn't feel comfortable with having sex. We do everything else like oral sex, kissing intimately etc. However I think the depression side of her affects the sex as she isn't completely comfortable with her body. She is even scared to use tampons as she might get \"Toxic Shock Syndrome\". Nothing wrong with not wanting to use tampons but it feels like she is quite apprehensive to penetration.\n\n- Her career aspirations and financial goals are really out of reach and unrealistic. She is studying arts at university to one day live in America to pursue acting (we live in New Zealand). However she never wants to audition for things as she says she hasn't reached her ideal weight and doesn't feel comfortable with herself. I find this an issue as she will say things like \u201cI\u2019m too good to be working this retail job\u201d or \u201cPeople should be lucky to be in my presence\u201d.\n\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that we both get a monthly Airbnb where we see how things go;\n\nMe: I think we should consider getting a monthly AirBnB to see how we transition to not only living together in the same city but also the same home.\n\nHer: If I\u2019m being honest, if I were to tell my work friends about this they would find that really embarrassing. And you know my friends come up to me and go \u201cWhat the fuck are you still doing with that guy?\u201d Maybe you think this way because you're 24. \n\nMe: Wow okay I just think it\u2019s a good idea.\n\nHer: I\u2019ve been at my parents house for 28 years and I\u2019m sick of it!\n\nMe: Yeah but you have to see it from my perspective, I would be giving up my whole support system which includes my friends and family and everything I know.\n\nHer: Okay\u2026 okay\u2026 okay\u2026\n\nMe: We also have to consider the financial aspect of this move.\n\nHer: Omg moving shouldn\u2019t be this difficult, I just want to be with someone who is fun! You are making this heaps depressing!\n\nMe: Well if we can have adult conversations about me moving interstate, can we please have adult conversations about the level of intimacy we have been having?\n\nHer: You\u2019re not going to like my answer.\n\nMe: What is it?\n\nHer: I just don\u2019t think we\u2019re meant to be together. You know what I\u2019m just calling it, don\u2019t even bother moving down, I\u2019m breaking up with you.\n\nShe was adamant about the break up.\n\nNow I haven't been responding to her messages because she was rude with the break-up by not listening to anything I had to say and it has gotten to the point where she has gotten her friends and family to try and contact me. She even called me 10 times in the span of 30 mins.\n\nShe sent me a text message after two weeks saying this:\"Hey I hope you've been okay. I would really love to talk again when you're ready. I love you and miss you so much. I'm really sorry about our last conversation, I just want you to know that I value your opinion so much because you are the person I respect the most. I want to listen to your ideas. You mean the world to me and the last thing I ever wanted to do was break up. I'm sorry for ever saying that and for the way I ended our conversation. I want to support you and see you succeed in everything you do in life. I'm also sorry for my family and friends contacting you over the last couple of weeks, I want to give you your space if that's what you need, I was just genuinely so scared that something bad had happened because I've never not been able to reach you before, and we were just checking in because we all care about you so much, they understand if you just needed some time to yourself. The thought of you not being okay honestly kills me inside. I hope we can resolve everything because you're so special and important to me and I want to do whatever you're comfortable with. I would love to stay together in an air BnB and take it from there. I'm sorry I didn't understand the first time you brought it up.

The last position he had was working at the local university as a writing tutor for the college students; it didn\u2019t pay much but it was something he really enjoyed. He graduated college in May 2014 and because colleges normally hire students, so this made him ineligible for the position post-graduation. He recently obtained his license last October and I got mine in Spring. I have been working since high-school but he has not had any occupation since. \n\nBecause my mother and I are the only ones in the house, I was essentially obligated to go to work and provide support for the household alongside her income. However, Blake (fake name) lives with his parents and his sibling (21+F). His dad works at a factory in the next town over and his mom deals with the housework and other odds and ends that needs to be done like medical appointments for their Uncle. His sister is currently unemployed, also.\n\nMy mom has been and still is concerned about the fact that Blake doesn\u2019t have the get-up-and-go attitude about \u201cwinning the bread\u201d like most guys usually do. I\u2019ve defended him over and over to her saying that because he didn\u2019t have his license and that his parents wouldn\u2019t take him to a job if he needed transportation until he got both his car and license; I couldn\u2019t do anything about it and I would get frustrated every time it would come up because it was the same spiel each time. I have been in his corner since I have been with him but he feels like me defending him to my mother isn\u2019t something spectacular of a favor. We recently (like a couple days ago) had a conversation where I told him that I would do \\*anything\\* for him and he quips back with \u201cWhat have you done for me\u201d and I told him about trying go to bat for him and he responds with \u201cthat\u2019s your definition of anything?\u201d. Honestly that fucking hurt. \n\nHe\u2019s made the excuses to me over the years that when his funds in his bank account get low enough, he\u2019ll look for a job. For context, this is money that he had saved in his account during college while he was attending and then he ended up getting another lump sum through the stimulus checks from the pandemic relief (we live in the U.S.). He\u2019s also skirted around his money issues by selling high priced items out of his videogame collection or dumping his TCG collection when he quit Yu-gi-Oh; he recently sold Wild Arms 5 for like $200 and he was fine with letting it go because it was collecting dust and he never intended on booting up his PS2 to play it. \n\nHe promised me that after the holidays, that he\u2019d look for a job. A few days ago, I told him about this one clerical position at this dental office and it turns out that the listing links to a different opening, Dental Hygienist, I think it was but he brushed it off and said that he\u2019d look on his own.\n\nIt was either a couple days or the day after that I, albeit passive-aggressively, go \u201cweird that you said after the holidays you\u2019d look and you haven\u2019t started looking that much\u201d and in my defense I was annoyed that he\u2019s started listing expensive video games again to pad out his funds; he didn\u2019t even have to tell me that. He refutes back with \u201cIt\u2019s been a week\u201d and I go \u201cyeah? It\u2019s after the holidays\u201d and he says that he\u2019s going to be putting in for a couple things once he gets to talk to his other Uncle that works at the place he\u2019s applying for. Though from my experience, his Uncle doesn\u2019t come to his house very often for whatever reason so I know this\u2019ll be dragged out into oblivion if I don\u2019t say something about it. I asked him why he couldn\u2019t text his Uncle and he goes \u201cit\u2019s easier to talk in person since he hardly answers messages and the openings on the website have been there for months so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going anywhere anytime soon\u201d\n\nI keep pressing with \u201cbut you can\u2019t submit an application until you talk to your Uncle?\u201d \n\nB: \u201cI\u2019d like to know which positions he knows the supervisors for; he told me he\u2019d tell me when I was gonna apply\u201d\n\nM: \u201cI\u2019m sure you could probably call him\u201d\n\nB: \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate you hounding me about this\u201d\n\nM: \u201cYou have more interest in selling your expensive games than you do contacting your uncle about who he knows in what dept\u201d\n\n* \u00b7 This was because I asked him what he\u2019d been doing that day and he said that he was busy listing things on eBay\n\nB: \u201cplease don\u2019t do this tonight\u201d\n\nM: \u201cyou\u2019re not wiggling out of this\u201d\n\nB: \u201cdon\u2019t start jumping down my throat\u201d\n\nM: \u201cmaybe you should get your priorities straight\u201d\n\nThe next day he sends me a text message saying that he e-mailed his Uncle his resume and that he told him that he wanted anything that he thought that Blake could get I told him that he was doing that scrambling thing where when I get extremely annoyed and pissy about something genuine, he starts to \u201cfix things\u201d and he told me, word for word \u201cnot everything is about you\u201d and I let him know it sure is funny how fast he does something when it\u2019s brought up.\n\n* There have multiple times where I have broken up with him over things and he \"gets his ducks in a row\", we get back together but then it eventually goes back to the same old routine\n\nThe past few months, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of my ADHD medication or because of the current relationship issues, but I have been in this weird \u201ccould go without any mention of sex for months\u201d funk.

Three of us spent months living in a small an cramped hotel room barely scraping by because covid really didnt help us when it came down to getting a job and the hotel was cheap cause it was in a extremely shady part of town however on this particular morning i went to pay for my room i came upstairs to see the house keepers at my door with small caramel colored puppy.\n\nAnyone else would immediately be suspicious about  this especially after the head housekeeper was arrested earlier that week for thief but this time they were here cause of the pupoy being abandoned and the manager water us to what this little guy And well we did. We whatched the dog up until the managers themselves let us know that due to the abandonment of the dog and the fact they destroyed their room the owners wouldn't be getting the dog until they pay for the damages. We seen the room and it was god awful and the managers had the right to not give them the doggo back. \n\nFast forward to the present, this puppy is now a big overgrown baby, my fiance and i arent homeless anymore and my bestie and i take turns keeping him for a few months and December she texts me about a bump growing on our dogs paw, its swollen and irritated but dont seem to be botbering him but she says that shes gonna take him to get check. On my end however im freaking tf out cause my dog is basically my child to me, i was already dealing with the stress of my apartment being shit and my own financial issues and let her know this because i cant work at the moment so i cant make money and she understands this. It wouldn't be an issue if i didnt wake up to see a picture of this bump and the fact that it looks like its worse.\n\nI dont wanna seem like im overreacting but its no way that you cause have our dog and not take him to get checked. I told her 5 times in the 4 months he's been with her that he has to go to the vet for his shots and get checked. I ate that i cant do it because i know that if i dont do it them nobody would. It just annoys me that she was so ready to keep him but ehen i need her to step up and be a owner with me she decided to blow her money on sex toys.\n\nIm aware im no better but i cant even take him to get checked cause my name isnt on his vet papers, i have been told thst itmuch be the owner on his papers that brings him in. Im so mad because at the end of the day i feel like an unheard father that have a baby mother that takes child support and blow it on everything other then their child. I get screamed at cause he isnt trained but i put in so much effort training him only for that to vanish when he goes to his mom. Im worried about my dog, i dont want harm to come to him especially since i put in so much time, love and care just for him to be the dog he is today.\n\nTl;dr My friend told me our dog should get check because of a bumo on his paw, she says she'll do it, instead she buys a bunch of unnecessary stuff instead of taking our baby to get checked\n\nPosted this somewhere else and sorry for formatting im on mobile", "title": "My best friend doesn't want to take oir dog to get checked"}, {"created_utc": 1642068656, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s2w5rh/help_21m_my_girlfriend_22f_tried_to_hurt_herself/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "Me and my girlfriend has been together for 5 months now, everything was going great before I found out she has been lying to her parents about me and my family (regarding status and morals).

One to her mother and another to her sister all small talk conversations. She comes out of the office and I let her know it hurts my feelings that after being done with work you can\u2019t leave the office and say hey and come see me. Instead I hear her just laughing and joking on the phone with her family. I tell her I feel last. Her response is that her sister called and she needed to call her back. She then says excuse me for caring about my sister. I say that\u2019s understandable what I\u2019m asking for is to be greeted and spoken to first all you have to say is hey love I miss you and kiss and give me a min I need to call my sister. She says oh you want me to submit to you and calls me ungrateful. \n\nThat hurts my heart. \n\nShe knows I\u2019ve been pretty depressed and told me to seek therapy and I have.

Perhaps I am. \n\nShe said I don\u2019t express myself to her so I have and I\u2019m told I\u2019m ungrateful and if I want to spend more time with her I need to step up and remove things off her plate.

We spent a lot of time talking after that, and became good friends before we started dating. \n\nBefore our relationship, I never thought anything of him until he confessed to me and eventually asked me out. I was initially hesitant about this and suggested that he go to college first and gain more experience before we went through with a relationship, as a relationship with him had never crossed my mind and I was looking at what I thought were his best interests at the time.\n\nAfter the many discussions we\u2019ve had, he still insisted that a relationship with me was what he wanted, and with much consideration, I ended up caving in.\n\nEver since then, we\u2019ve been in a relatively happy and healthy relationship together (there were some ups and downs at first, but we\u2019ve come a long way!). We practice open communication, productive conflict resolution, are each other\u2019s go-to person for emotional support and we put a lot of emphasis on consent and respecting each other\u2019s boundaries (and to clarify, we are in a LDR and have not had any sexual exchanges, although legally the AOC is 16 in both of our states). \n\nHis family and my family are aware of our relationship and they are all supportive of it, as we\u2019ve both had a positive impact on each other\u2019s lives and have had a lot of character growth being around each other.  \n\nHowever, lately I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of controversial opinions and commentary about the subject of age differences in relationships. I\u2019ve come across several Tiktoks where people have voiced that they felt \u201cicky\u201d about anyone above the age of 18 dating anyone 16-17 years old, and now I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m doing something morally wrong because I do understand where those individuals are coming from. \n\nWhen I was around my boyfriend\u2019s age I was also in an age gap relationship, except it was with someone significantly older than me who was a groomer and was also manipulative/abusive (I was 16/17 while said person was 28-30 at the time). I would never want to put my boyfriend through what I had been through, so I have always put in a lot of effort to be mindful and vigilant about my actions around him.\n\nEven though I try my best to be a healthy partner for my boyfriend, I\u2019ve started to question myself as a person for dating him because of those commentaries. Just the thought of being labelled as a \u201cgroomer\u201d or a \u201ccreep\u201d for dating someone younger than me is eating me up inside, and I don\u2019t know what to do with these feelings.

I remember exactly how confused and mentally exhausted I was at that point. Reading the responses and having my feelings validated by a bunch of internet strangers gave me the confidence to know I wasn\u2019t being too sensitive (f that). It also got me out of a constant state of rumination about what was happening to me and why I felt so off and not myself and led me to act.\n\nI told him I wanted space and that if we were both trying our best and our relationship felt like this we had a huge problem. I also told him that at some point he had stopped treating me like his girlfriend and started treating me like a defective human being and I was over it and wouldn\u2019t continue to invest my time and energy into someone who treated me this way. \n\nThose first few days I spent alone were like an f-ing vacation. I couldn\u2019t believe how amazing it felt to do simple, every day things without his constant interference and judgement. At the same time,  I did start to notice some of the things I was blaming him for being critical of me were really areas I was insecure and being critical of myself. I spent more time over the next few months investing in myself and and improving certain areas of my life.\n\nOur relationship seemed to improve slightly over the next few months. The micromanaging and criticism really improved or I thought they improved. He might have just changed tactics. I think he started triangulating and upping the ante with the \u201cinnocent\u201d insults. I think I had also gotten better at dealing with it and probably lowered the bar even more.\n\nIn the fall I had my first ever sciatica flare up. It was agonizing pain almost constantly. It lasted 8 weeks and I was trying everything - physical therapy, anti inflammatories, bio freeze, ice, not moving, powering through the pain. He was over it all after a few weeks and starting treating me like I was a lazy slob. I felt so scared and helpless about how much pain I was in and if It was ever going to get better or would I need surgery. The added stress of still trying to be a good partner was horrible. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why this instance of his selfishness had more impact, but I felt something change inside of me in a profound way. Of course when I tried to talk to him about it, it went very poorly. The argument ended when he mocked me for crying and asked me why I couldn\u2019t talk to him like a normal person .\n\nI can\u2019t remember when it started but I began to have physical responses during any kind of conflict with him. Sort of like fight or flight maybe? My hands start shaking, I start feeling overwhelmed and confused, my stomach is flipping, and eventually the tears come.\n\nThis comment from my original post rings true:\n\n\u201cIt seriously sounds like a low key gateway to emotional abuse. I can't imagine his BS only starts and stops at just hacking away at OPs self worth and then gaslighting her about what's happening.\n\nThose people get worse as the relationship goes on, not better.\u201d\n\nThe BS certainly didn\u2019t stop there. There were so many instances during our relationship where I felt he had lied to me. There were constant interactions where my instincts told me he was being inauthentic or he was hiding something or not giving me all the details. The addictions. The attention he gave women on social media. Always needing someone to blame. An almost embarrassing inability to take accountability.\n\nI still feel pretty conflicted about what I did. I went through his phone. I started by looking for a couple specific times in the beginning of our relationship where my mind had flagged something as off or a lie but I had no idea why. Like when he insisted we go drop a bottle of champagne off to a friend of his as a congratulations for getting a new job. At the time I couldn\u2019t place what felt off about this. I looked at texts from this specific date and now I know that we were really there to deliver cocaine. When I was able to confirm what my instincts told me were lies it was off to the races.\n\nIt was all pretty bad. He was on tinder for the first 6 months we were together, bumble for 9, and plenty of fish 11. All texts with other women deleted. Secret drug use. It\u2019s hard to even remember everything but I tried to just confirm what I had felt to be lies. \n\nThere is definitely a ton of anger and sadness but more than anything else I felt relief. Everything my instincts have been telling me since the beginning have been accurate and I have been fighting a losing battle against them. It felt freeing. \n\nWhy have I continued this relationship in spite my instincts for 2.5 years and endless stress and chaos? My hair has been thinning since the 3 month mark in our relationship. I\u2019ve had brain fog and memory problems despite being known for my iron trap memory. Sleeping issues. Weight fluctuations. My body has been physically rejecting this relationship. Somehow I either couldn\u2019t admit that it was him or I was really that out of it. I\u2019m starting to try and unwind it all in therapy.  I have had 3 sessions so far and am scheduled weekly for the foreseeable future. What I have learned so far is I was taught to not trust my feelings as a child by my Dad, who is very likely a narcissist. I\u2019m really excited to work on my toxic patterns and behaviors in therapy and make the relationship I have with myself better and my priority.\n\nWe have been living in separate bedrooms for a couple weeks. The initial confrontation was horrible and I hurled some really rough insults and names at him. A few weeks ago I was thinking that I would have a final discussion about why we were breaking up and the logistics of him moving out etc. It still almost felt like I was going to have to convince him that this was a good enough reason to break up. \n\nAfter a deadline for work is over in the next couple days I\u2019m going to tell him the relationship is over because I want it to be. And I do. I\u2019m going to offer to pay for movers so I have an exact date he will be gone. I am nervous about his reaction and scared of what he might say to hurt me but I have never been more certain I\u2019m making the right decision  so I know I\u2019ll be able to handle whatever happens.\n\nAgain, thank you endlessly to anyone who took the time to comment on my original post or reached out. I felt seen and heard that day in a way that woke me up and nudged me to really start paying attention and stop turning everything inward. \n\nTL;DR I wasn\u2019t being too sensitive; we are incompatible. He was not only making my life a living hell with all the criticism, gaslighting, and passive aggressive jabs, he was also a liar and a cheater. Coming to terms with all of it and working on myself in therapy.\n\nOh and one more thing - In my original post I played dumb about what he was insinuating when commenting about the shorts with the wet waistband. I was so paranoid at that time I wanted to see if other people came to the same conclusion that I had.

To make things easy we\u2019ll call my brother Junior.\n\nWhen I was 15 our mom moved halfway across the country and I went with her. Junior moved in with his grandparents (not related to me) as they had better resources for children with Autism near them. Despite not seeing one another for 6 years, we are fairly close. Every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday we play Minecraft together and talk. He tells me about school, his friends, and tells me stories he made up. It\u2019s a good time overall. I love my brother and onely want the best for him. I always promised him that I\u2019d help him however I can when he needs me. Sometimes he comes to me for advice on growing up, jobs, credit cards, etc.\n\nMy problem comes in that, lately, Junior has been saying some stuff that is concerning. He writes little stories that are, essentially, self-insert fan-fiction. Nothing wrong with that and I always listen to him tell a me them. Imagine a 4Kids Sonichu but without the hatred and angst. They\u2019re fun to listen to because he acts out the lines and goes into extreme detail. But lately, after being egged on by a neurotypical friend, my brother has gained a budding superiority complex. His friend is always complimenting his stories and asking to hear them and now Junior says things like, \u201cI used to think I was just a normal kid with creativity. But now I know I have a powerful skill.\u201d I had asked him what he meant and he said he never realized how amazingly talented he is and that he\u2019s going to begin publishing his scripts online and sending his stories to publishing houses.\n\nI don\u2019t want him to stop writing because he is very creative and imaginative. I just think he needs to refine  it and learn how to write in a more structured way. I even sent him creative writing classes he can do on Skillshare. But he is convinced he\u2019s a phenomenal author right now and is going to be the next breakthrough in creative writing. I don\u2019t want people to read what he wrote and send hate comments or something that would hurt his feelings. How can I be supportive without hurting his feelings or lying to him?

I suspect some people are gonna call me weak/pathetic for the situation I'm in. So to keep this fast, I feel weak and pathetic for letting this happen so please don't PM me telling me that. Ofc, all names and identifying info is all fake to keep this anonymous as possible.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI live in a city/area where the prices of housing and rent is extremely high and the vacancy rate is extremely low. My parents gave me a great offer- live at home through university and first two years of working to build up my savings account so I have enough to put a down payment on an apartment. Through university and the two years of working, this was all great. They pretty much treated me like an adult (except the odd parental advice of eating healthy) and I had a family to go back home to on the weekdays- there was pretty much no downside to this arrangement. \n\n**The main story:** \n\nJump to two years ago and I had an extremely stressful year- one of my grandparents ended up in hospital, my dog tore a tendon in his leg running up the stairs (the surgery cost me $2500), got passed over for promotion at work, the vet found out that my dog was terminally ill and had to put him down...while I was away for work and some friendships fell apart. All of these resulted in me having an...incident and a trip to the ER. After a bunch of tests, I was diagnosed with a neurological condition which causes these \"incidents\" under certain conditions, one being extremely stressed out. After feeling like crap from letting bottling my emotions up put me in the ER, I ended up seeking psychological help and the psychologist diagnosed me with depression. My parents were there when the doctor diagnosed me with my neurological condition and I told them about my depression since bottling this stuff up sent me to the ER.\n\nEver since then, my parents have been treating me with kid gloves. My mom took some of what the doctor said and some of what she found on the internet (and I suspect some info from that quack Dr. Oz) and combined it into a lifestyle she deems is the most appropriate. I feel like I'm 16-17 again with my parents constantly asking how I am, how I should live and giving me lectures on how my lifestyle will cause another \"incident\" (like really condescendingly). I've asked them to stop, I told them I know what the doctor said and I'm doing what he said and what you're telling me to do is what you read on the internet and **not** what he said at all. My mom took the most offense to that and said we're just trying to be your parents and if you don't like it we can treat you like a tenant and charge you more rent and you can eat on your own. I just want everything to go back to our original arrangement. I still want them to be my parents and have a family when I come home from work. I get that they have my best interests at heart but I'm feeling like a child.\n\nSo, to keep the peace, I've followed some of the advice that my mom found from the internet to keep them quiet and happy. But this advice has been so restrictive and I feel like a teenager again. My girlfriend has suggested we move in together and we're looking into doing it next year (once we have enough savings). I still want my parents to go back to our original arrangement. So, I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to gently tell my parents to back off a bit and let me have a little more freedom without triggering my mom's angry mode?\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: I'm living at home to save money for a house (rent &amp; housing is very limited and expensive where I live). A couple years ago I was diagnosed with depression and a neurological condition which triggers when extremely stressed. Because of this, my parents are basically back to treating me like a child and that's both irritating, degrading and causing me more stress. I tried talking to them and they basically resorted to gaslighting and now I'm figuring out when I can move out. Is there anything to do in the meantime to keep the peace between us?", "title": "I [26/M] was diagnosed with a neurological condition a while back and my parents [60/M &amp; 60/F] have resorted to treating me like a child in the interest of \"keeping me healthy\".

I fell in love with a girl and we hit it off pretty well online. I found out about a month back that she had just broken up with a relationship with another guy, and immediately right after got with someone else (who goes to the same uni both of us attend). Now that we're all at uni, it's so difficult for me to see her together with him and I'm just looking for someone who can sympathize/understand my situation.\n\nNot gonna lie, the more I think about it the more I realize 2020 has just been a shit year when it comes into relationships. With there being periodic lockdowns in my country it has just been extremely difficult for us to get out there and meet our friends just like we used to.\n\nNow the situation begins several months back, when this girl at my uni slides up on one of my social media stories, after which we start talking over social media. The first day of class she asked to call me, and we talked for like almost five hours/watched a movie, at which point I realized I forgot to start all of my assignments \ud83d\ude02 I got her number from there, and throughout the first semester, we shared many classes together and often studied together for them. And after our study sessions, we'd stay on the line to talk to each about random stuff - both funny things and tons of deep things too.\n\nI hold a near full-time job outside of school, and towards the end of the semester I became overwhelmed with finals week approaching and work picking up pace. I stopped talking to her that much because I wanted to focus on myself during that especially stressful time period, with the intention of returning back to talk to her after the semester ends. This was also the first time when I realized that I kinda had feelings for her.\n\nNow the first semester ends, and I was working part-time over break. I decided to call her up but she seemed kind of distant - like something bad had affected her. I later found out from a mutual friend that this whole time I was talking to her, she was actually dating another guy from her hometown and they had just broken up. When I found out about that I was kind of shocked, but I didn't let that get too much in the way of things.\n\nWe finally started talking again later in the break, and we'd spend hours on the phone - just like we used to and talk about everything that has happened to both of us in the meantime. Truth be told, those were some of my favorite moments - I realized that she meant so much more to me and that she was a person I could lean on infinitely for support and help. It was also at this time that I heard from a friend in passing that some other guy was interested in her and commenting on all of her social media posts with super flirty messages - but at first I didn't think too much of it because I was afraid I'd overreact. \n\nMy fears indeed came true, and like three weeks after her breakup, she began seeing this new guy. I couldn't do anything about it because I lived far away at the time, though I've since moved. No matter how hard I was trying, there was simply nothing I could do to prevent them from being together. And do I have any regrets? Of course. They made it official a few days ago, and he's taller, more athletic, and more confident that I am. I deeply regret not doing more of those things to make myself become more like him - these past few nights have been agonizing because I keep on thinking about the \"what ifs.\" If I had taken more time to work out over the summer, for example, would she have liked me more than him? If one of our mutual friends happened to be in another place so she never got introduced to her current boyf? I have been unable to focus because of these thoughts.\n\nI realize this might seem like a long and meaningless post to most, but I hope that some of you strangers out there can help me find solace with the situation because I've hit possibly one of the lowest points in my life because of this.

He paid our rent, and my mom paid our utilities for us while I'm in college as a full time student. But he started to get really angry at me for not doing all of the cooking and house work. He believes that he shouldn't have to help because he works full time and I'm unemployed. He asked me to move out, but was really upset and asked me to stay when I started looking for somewhere else to live. This may be a gendered issue, but I'm standing firm on my opinion, just included that detail to give some insight to our relationship. Just to clarify, we live separately now but we're still together.\n\nWe've also had a pretty dead sex life for over a year. I have a really high libido and this issue has been a theme in a lot of my relationships. I've been honest with him but he has never really made an effort to fix the problem. But for a while now I've found myself not caring anymore because I'm not attracted to him like I used to be. When we started dating he was a \"gym rat\" and we did a lot of hiking/physical activities together, but now he's let himself go. He's gained weight, isn't hygienic, and never puts himself together anymore. He's always in his underwear with unkempt hair because he works from home remotely on account of the pandemic. I've never addressed this issue with him and maybe that's a problem. I don't want to make him feel bad about himself, but it's at the point where I fantasize about being single and I dread the thought of staying with him. It physically pains me to turn down some of the men I've met since my relationship went downhill. I feel like I'm missing out on some really great experiences but I simultaneously feel so guilty for lusting after other men when my boyfriend is such a nice guy.

They recently found out that the prayer lady tested positive for the virus, therefore I believe that my grandmother may have got the virus from her. Even if she didn\u2019t, she was still exposed to it. My mother to my knowledge is not showing symptoms, however I would feel safer if she and my brother got tested before I went up to their apartment.  \n\nMy father(66) is a recent cancer survivor and there\u2019s a 1 in 3 chance that it will come back. My stepmother(67) is diabetic. They both have high blood pressure and I can\u2019t take the chance of bringing COVID into our house as they are both high risk. \n\nWhen I brought up the COVID test, my brother got pissed and refused to take it. I just don\u2019t feel comfortable being around anybody who were recently exposed to it without them getting a test done. They want me to stay up there for several days. \n\nBesides the virus issue, I am also starting a new job next week. I can\u2019t just take a few days of my first week. I could end up losing the job and I\u2019ve tried so hard to find one. I do love my family, but it\u2019s just not feasible for me to go up there right now. And I honestly don\u2019t think me going up there would do anybody any good. I can\u2019t go up there and pretend that I\u2019m sad about my grandmother being gone. I\u2019m not happy, but I\u2019m also not sad. I\u2019m not in grief. I don\u2019t have happy memories of her.

Did my own research and found his instagram profile which just made me more interested. He collects some vinyls (I do too) and takes photos (I do too kinda but the point is him being creative which I am a lot). I didn't follow him at that point.\n\nBut at New Years night my friend who knew about this guy since I had told her, she had my phone and followed him. I was quite devastated because I was scared I'd come across as creepy since I haven't really talked to him besides taking his order. Also she followed him when it was 3 am. But after this he came to eat at my work place one day and it didn't seem too awkward so I thought maybe I was just overthinking it. He never followed me back though. I could excuse this by saying he probably didn't saw my follow because he has quite a lot of them (1.4k) and I followed him during night time, but let's leave it as that.\n\nFast forward to me and my friend going to the streetwear shop where he works at because they had a sale and they carry one of my favorite brands.

When I saw her one week after sleeping with her, she did say she thought it was strange how I left and that she wanted me to stay and later texted me that she found it \u201enice that you came by to my office\u201c.... \n\nDuring the second date and prior to being invited to her place, we talked as we walked and spoke about different things and i asked her about her ex boyfriends and me about ex girlfriends. She told me about the most recent one and who is based in Germany and that this was the toughest one as she really loved him but  since he didn\u2019t move out of Germany with her they broke up.  I knew the way she spoke about him that it was a red flag for me because I could tell she still thought about him.  Despite that, we still had a great time and kept the communication going and the flirtation and as i said ended up at her place where I gave her a great orgasm.\n\nOn Monday two weeks ago she pops up to my office for a short exchange and in the conversation i asked her if she had recently met up with anyone / dated and she hesitated until she finally mentioned that two weeks ago she got the news that her boyfriend will be moving to the city as of June and that she \u201cwants to give that another try\u201d, apparently she was going to let me know as soon as she figured it out but clearly I got it out of her first. Clearly this has been in the pipeline because especially in these times, you don\u2019t move out of a country and find a new job in one day.  She admitted it\u2019s been in the pipeline but only very recently found out for sure he would be moving here. But even in my office when unasked her \u201edon\u2019t you notice from my mashing that my face looks more glowing because of the cleansing?\u201c!she responded with \u201e I prefer the other glow\u201c with a smile. I think she meant the after sex glow so I took that as yet another attempt at flirting with me even though she had told me about getting back with the ex!!\n\ni was hurt because even though we did say we would be casual, the fact that we go so close in those two dates and she had AGREED to meet up again and she had KNOWN about her ex coming back but was still flirting with me for another date and saying I am a \"fascinating guy\" and \"want to get to you know you more\" and basically gave all the signs of interest. Even on Monday, two weeks after knowing about his return, she was still open to meet up with me again and made a cheeky remark of the sex we had. \n\nShe also said she was not sure if she wanted to go back to her ex or not and was figuring it out and realized she \u201cwould be stupid not to give that a try\u201d.. she also  said i should not be expecting her to be so open about her feelings because we only met twice, but I also think I have a right to know because she could have spared me the effort of texting and making plans for future dates by telling me this. It felt like I was thus led on to fill the void of her ex while she was figuring out seeing him again. In fact, she also said that she had dated \u201ehalf the city\u201c to see if she can move on from him / get over him and had low self esteem and was dating men out of desperation.\n\nThe conversation got a bit heated and she started saying \u201etell me what I should do to make it up to you?\u201c........and 10 mins after she left to go home she texted me a voice message:\n\n\u201c hi Tom, im sorry for getting angry at you when I don\u2019t have a Right to be. I\u2019m sorry if you felt I strung you along. I hope we can be friends\u201d\n\nI responded with:\n\n\u201eI remember when I told you once when we first met up that I hope we don\u2019t hurt the other person, because at the time it felt too good to be true and i guess I was right. I can\u2019t accept that a woman tells me she thinks I\u2019m fascinating and that she wants to get to know me only to turn around and say that someone else is coming to town and she would be stupid not to give that a try. It makes me feel like I was a commodity and was taken for granted. If you truly felt what you said you did you would not have caved in so quickly. I can\u2019t add anymore to this and I  am very hurt by you and there is nothing more I can add to it. It\u2019s a shame but it is what it is.\n\nShe replied:\n\n\u201c.....I understand you are hurt and I didn\u2019t want to treat you as a commodity that was not my intention. I do like You and find you very interesting and do want to be friends with you. I have said everything, I like you and did want to tell you that as soon as I had it figured out that I am not available (in reference to her ex boyfriend moving to our city next month and her wanting to give that another shot). Please believe me that I didn\u2019t do it on purpose and it was no purpose of mine to play you or string you along and I really don\u2019t think I did string you along but if you feel that way it\u2019s your right, but I didnt do it on purpose or to spite you, I actually quite like you, and hope we can keep in touch as friends but that\u2019s obviously for you to decide but I would be happy if we would..\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been 17 days and I haven\u2019t responded.\n\nBefore of any of you say I\u2019m a pussy or a little boy for making such a big deal about it because it\u2019s only \u201etwo dates\u201c, for me it\u2019s all the things she did and said that indicated she wanted to see how things developed between us and I genuinely thought that. She even admitted that we acted as \u201emore than friends\u201c and had chemistry\u201c and she finds me \u201efascinating\u201c. Clearly these are not things that casual folks think of each other.\n\nTl;dr:  girl I was seeing suddenly wants to get back with ex who is moving here", "title": "Should she have told me about ex boyfriend returning into her life despite us being casual and non-exclusive?

After summer camp was over she found the picture on FB and confronted me, I told her the truth, that I forgot about that so I didn't tell her. Apparently that is when everything started going down hills regarding the jealousy, insecurities etc etc. There are some details I do not want to leave out: She also says another reason she started to be like this is because when summer camp was over she found selfies of me and camp friends (wasn't doing anything inappropriate in them, just normal selfies), selfies that I also did not tell her about because I didn't think it mattered. \n\nShe also says that she lost trust in me because I told her a lot of little lies. Let me tell you some examples of these \"little lies\": One time I was on a trip with my family, my gf didn't want me to go to the beach because there were girls in bikini there and I wasn't allowed to look at them (not like I wanted to look at them anyways). So to be sure I asked my parents if we were going anywhere near the beach, they said no. I told this to my gf and she was like \"ok :)\".  My family and I then proceed to go to the trip but at the last minute they decided to go to the beach for a walk and yes my gf considered this a lie because I told her that my parents said we weren't. I also couldn't enjoy the beach, I had to look at the floor or the sky all the time to avoid looking at girls.\n\nSo, now that everyone probably understands the situation better, I'll continue. Like I said, after the camp incident everything started going downhills with her issues(let's call \"issues\" her jealousy, insecurities, easily mad and controlling behavior). The first and second years and a half after the camp were the worst regarding her issues, these are the things I wasnt allowed do and majority of them still can't do:\n\n- Can't watch movies, series, animes etc. that contains nudity or even normal sex scenes. Also, if im in the movie theater with her and there is a sex scene I HAVE to look another way until she says so.\n\n- can't go out with friends to normal places like beaches or go out for a drink. I cannot have female friends.\n\n- If I am out with her I have to be careful not to look by accident or on purpose at an attractive girl or even average girl. Basically if we go to a mall for example I'll have to walk 70% of the time looking at the floor, ceiling or at her to avoid any fights.\n\n- If I do go out with my family to a normal place like the mall, I have to text her A LOT and she starts asking a lot of questions unless she is at work. Also, if I am with a friend in college she again starts texting me a lot asking what we talking about and stuff like that and I feel like I can't talk to my friend without being worried.\n\n- Can't do anything that involves females basically, unless it's my mom of sister.\n\n- can't have social platforms like Instagram or Facebook unless I follow exactly who she wants only and male friends.\n\nI feel like she has isolated me from the social world. After a year and a half or two \"following EVERY rule\" that she has I started doing things I \"wasn't allowed to\" because I couldn't handle it anymore. First I met friends (4 friends) that I only told my gf of two of them, because the other 2 are female friends. I went out with friends, watched movies at home without the worry of it containing nudity, went out to places like the beach, and socialized (normally not flirty or anything) with females and males without worrying about the rules. I started doing these type of stuff after she moved to the USA and we have since then been in a long distance relationship. I know it's bad that I started doing things (that I wasn't allowed to) without her knowing, I was just so tired of being alone in my room without any friends and I basically wasn't allowed to do anything.\n\nTo this day I feel bad that I've been doing things without telling her. And guys...I've tried everything since the beginning to help her reduce her issues, anything that you think of I've tried it already. I've also told her to go to therapy but SHE DOESN'T WANT TO, every time I try to convince her to go she tells me that the therapist wouldn't understand her, she doesn't let me or anyone help her with her issues. \n \nThe worst thing guys is that I would've break up with her a long time ago but... I love her I really do love her. We have planned our future multiple times already including names for our kids and stuff like that. Whenever we are not fighting or her issues aren't involved we actually always have an amazing time and she's actually very sweet and cute. She's a beautiful beautiful girl, we laugh a lot together, have a lot of beautiful memories and we even lost our virginity together. I wish the relationship was always this beautiful but it is like this 35-40% of the time. At first the relationship was always this beautiful but after the camp...you now know what happened.\n\nIf you've read to this point THANK YOU, it means a lot to me. \n\nWhat is your opinion guys? Who is in the wrong here?  What should I do? Should I tell her all I've done without her knowing? I really fucking love her but she is controlling my life too much :/ \n\nIf you guys think I should break up, HOW do I even do it? After all these years together it is not that easy to just go. \n\nANY advice is appreciated guys, THANK YOU!\n\nNote: I never cheated guys, not once. I also don't think the camp situation is that extreme for her issues to get this bad.\n\n\nTL;DR - My gf  has been too controlling, extremely jealous and gets mad very easy. I started doing stuff I wasn't allowed to (like going to the beach) without her knowing. I know I should break up but I love her too much. What should I do?

I see her around town occasionally, but our break up was a painful/bad one and we don't speak.

He posts about her often, but it's always just things like \"blessed to have such a beautiful girlfriend\" or talking about how she's pretty. He never says anything else, and it drives me crazy because she's so wonderful, smart, funny, kind, caring, spunky, and loving and so many other things. It's like the only thing he cares about is her beauty, and not her as a person.

On August of said year, his mother kicked him out of the house permanently (his and his mother's issues are a whole other story) so his adoptive father (let's call him Jeff) and step mother (let's call her Betty) took him in. They had a pretty normal dynamic for the past year and a half, until now. \n\nSo, a few months ago, Betty was diagnosed with anemia and other health issues, and because of the pandemic, my boyfriend (let's call him Nick) wasn't allowed to leave the house to avoid putting Betty at risk, which is very reasonable. However, the weekend after her diagnosis, turns out Jeff invited his pals over, without any safe distance measures nor protocols, which was weird. \n\nSince online school is still a thing, and not being able to travel, Nick stayed at home studying everyday and helping with chores around the house to show his gratefulness towards his \"parents\". \n\nNow, fast forward to April 2021. We both study at the same university, which is famous for it's student strikes and protests against whatever issue goes on at the moment. So, on April, his department goes into strike therefore all classes are canceled for an indeterminate period of time (still on strike to this day). Since there is nothing else for him to do but wait until classes get back to normal (online still) Nick decided to get a job to contribute with rent and get some money for himself. \n\nJeff HATED this. And has been extremely hostile towards Nick for going out everyday to work (even though he is applying safety measures). Betty doesn't really show much emotion, but she is taking Jeff's side and acting hostile and overall rude towards Nick. Nick is done with them, he has always been respectful towards them, thankful for what they have done for them and tried to help around the house. \n\nNick now told me that his parents have been criticizing me, our relationship, our beliefs (which we share), etc. They are constantly trying to put him down, shame him and make him feel guilty afterwards.

We have always gotten along and he\u2019s been nothing but kind, sweet, romantic, and someone I heavily connect with on an emotional and mental level. I love him so much, we FaceTime everyday and try to arrange times to eat together, watch movies together, etc. Up until now, we have had no issues with our relationship. \n\nWe started planning in March 2021 that I would go meet him for the first time as I actually had a trip booked to go to Egypt with two of my friends for January 2021, but with covid we had to cancel everything in December 2020. We assumed that with vaccinations and both of us have being vaccinated, that we could begin planning for me to go visit him this October over his birthday for 10 days. For the last year, I\u2019ve been under the impression that he lives alone in an apartment because that\u2019s what he has told me. I even suggested that I could get a hotel for myself while I visit him and he said \u201cwhy would you do that when I have an apartment for you to stay at?\u201d and even talked about future living arrangements like if I visited him for a year, he\u2019d let me stay at his \u201capartment\u201d rent free. He also had covid in April and told me how much he missed his family, but how grateful he was to be living away from them so he didn\u2019t carry a risk to passing along the virus to them. Last week while we were on FaceTime (it was 4am his time), I heard a woman\u2019s voice. He had to get up and excuse himself briefly. Then I heard a child crying and I became really suspicious. He ended up having to hang up and I asked him the next day if he had a woman over and told him I heard a child crying as well. He told me that he lives at home with his family, and that the woman\u2019s voice was his mother and that the child\u2019s cry was his sister. He was quite awkward and seemed guilty and I asked him why he lied to me about having an apartment, and he claims that he felt \u201cinferior\u201d to me because I\u2019ve been living on my own for 3 years now and he didn\u2019t want me to judge him for being 24 and still living at home. I told him that I was sorry he felt the need to hide that from me, but that he took the lying to the extreme when discussing rent and and living arrangements. That made me feel so uncomfortable knowing he was lying to me about all of that. \n\nAnother thing that I\u2019m finding real suspicious is his job. He\u2019s a teacher, that I know is true, but he and a lot of other teachers were laid off at the end of April due to covid and all the schools shutting down. He ended up finding a new job like 2 days later, was asked to be interviewed, and told me it was another teaching job. I was kind of confused because he told me there were no more jobs for teachers anymore because the schools were shut down. I didn\u2019t mention this to him though as I wanted to be positive and supportive prior to his interview. One of my closest friends is friends with him on Facebook and asked me yesterday how his new job with a telecommunications company is going. I was very confused and told her he doesn\u2019t work for any telecommunications company and that he found a new teaching job. She sent me a screen shot of a post he shared on May 16, stating that he begun work on May 16 with a telecommunications company. Confused as hell, I went onto his profile on my Facebook account and couldn\u2019t see the post. I assume he changed his privacy settings and has me blocked from seeing that particular post because I don\u2019t know why else I can\u2019t see it but my friend can. I haven\u2019t brought this up to him yet and don\u2019t know how to even approach it because I am in shock, confusion, and feel weird that he\u2019s still lying to me. \n\nAlthough I have definitely lost some trust for him, I still love him a lot and we are still together, but I made an agreement with him that when we meet for the first time, he will be coming to Canada. He accepted this and has apologized numerous times for lying to me about not having an apartment. Is it wrong for me to stay with him? Should I call him out on his lie about his new job?

It was a long term relationship and pretty serious on both parts. Completely took me by surprise and things didn't end very mutually. Essentially his reasons vary from feeling like I kept him from pursuing his dreams to needing therapy for some depression/thoughts to realizing our future goals just weren't compatible. I didn't take it well. This was honestly the most healthy relationship I have ever been in: we were able to communicate openly, we had amazing chemistry, he was my absolute best friend, and I am insanely attracted to him. It feels like there could have been compromises made or space given instead of a total break up though he is insistent that he can't be in a relationship right now. Since the initial end, I have reached out a few times to check on him (I was going through really similar stuff last year with depression/suicide and understand how scary and draining it is to start therapy) and I have initiated phone calls to get whatever closure I can. These calls were instigated by a friend sending me a screenshot where he had sent her a like on tinder just two weeks after he ended things. (I know that's not inherently wrong, just contradicted a lot of how we had left things before.) It's been a nightmare of a situation where he has stated he doesn't think he can be in touch for at least a while. I feel should clarify there has been no arguments through it all, though I have been open to disagreeing that breaking up was the answer. After almost a month, I still feel just as bad as the last day I saw him, waking up in physical pain and going to sleep in tears while I think about him. Every day, I work to do little things that normally bring me joy but it isn't working. I have even tried a dating app to help with my loneliness and could only bear to keep it for a few hours because all I did was think of him. It feels like an entire future has been ripped away and yet it's still the only future I can see. I still have his sweatshirt that I can't bear to return because then I know I've lost my last reason to contact him. I have lost my best friend and favorite person and, though I have a lot of really great friends who I love a lot and know love me, he has been completely irreplaceable. Genuinely, I just miss his friendship. He has hurt me a lot through the breakup and I'm not sure I can handle a romantic relationship with him or anyone for a good while but I don't think I can go on without any contact. I've never been in a situation where I feel so empty without a person and I'm not even sure being friends would fix that and I also don't want to be the clingy ex who tries to stay in touch after he has said he doesn't want it.\n\nI guess I'm here to ask if it is okay to reach out and apologize for any of my own actions that have hurt him and in doing so, ask if he is interested in working back towards a friendship? Or is it better to let him come to me if that's what he wants later on? If being in contact isn't the answer, how do I work to move on?\n\nTL;DR, Serious relationship ended leaving me feeling pretty empty and sad for almost a month. I miss my friendship with him but he doesn't want contact right now.

I\u2019ve never really been a jealous person. I have other friends and I never get like this when they talk to anyone else. I would hate when Emma\u2019s name was even brought up in conversations. I hated that Sammy would talk to her. It\u2019s not that Emma is a bad person or anything, she\u2019s sweet. So i couldn\u2019t understand why I was so angry. I\u2019m not romantically interested in Sammy at all,she\u2019s one of my closest friends. As months pass I started to get really anxious. Whenever Sammy would take too long to respond, or i\u2019d see that Sammy would get messages from anyone. I would start thinking that Sammy hated me, and that she likes everyone else more than me. It would make me angry when she talked about anyone who wasn\u2019t me. My mood would depend on if Sammy had texted me that night or hung out with me that day. I would be really happy whenever she would talk to me, like incredibly happy. But when she wouldn\u2019t talk to me that day, I would go into a depressive episode. I wouldn\u2019t eat, sleep, or move from my bed, and all i could do was cry and think about if she hates me. I would become angry with her for not talking to me everyday or asking how I was. It got to the point where I would go on social media and see if she was active that day. I would make fake accounts to try to talk to her and see if she\u2019d respond. It got to the point where I couldn\u2019t control myself whenever her name was even mentioned. When I tell her how that makes me feel, she says she\u2019ll try to do better with communicating, but she never does. I feel like a burden to her at this point.

In the morning, she huffs and puffs around the kitchen and common areas and takes loud phone calls. She's very clean, which is great but she also sends us very passive-aggressive notes when things aren't PERFECTLY clean. She has high standards, which I can appreciate but sometimes I feel like I can't live in my home.\n\nFurther, with the israel-palestine conflict, things have become extremely tense. My girlfriend is a black hyper-ethical socialist who's very politically active and into activism, and my friend is a white liberal who is pro-Biden and pro-israel and believes in \"birthright\" and defends the actions of Israelis and uses zionist talking points to defend the horrific actions in Gaza. She really believes in Israel as the homeland even though Israel is only 70 years old and was essentially colonized by the English in an area that was formerly only 8% Jewish before Jews immigrated there. (I'm not here to debate I/P, but to give you a grasp on how we feel vs she feels, this summarizes it whether you agree or disagree with either of us). She's been sending me on guilt trips, and being extremely emotional about the IP conflict and acting victimized by Instagram infographics my girlfriend posts about the conflict.

It's stressful seeing how much stress she's going through, feeling like she lives with a racist, zionist person. I want to ask her to leave, my girlfriend is willing to offer her 2-3k to buy her out of the lease. It will be more difficult for my roommate to find a room right now because we live in NYC and rents were at record lows in the winter, but now they're a bit pricier. She can afford a bit more, but she doesn't want to of course. I'm sure she'll feel betrayed but honestly, I don't think we're compatible as friends anymore. She still thinks we're extremely tight BFFs but she has barely asked what is going on with me in months and is very narcissistic in some regards.\n\nTLDR: My roommate situation with my girlfriend and friend is hell bc of oppositional views and lifestyles.

She admitted that she basically felt the same, and was feeling guilty about it. We never did anything, but she decided it wasn't fair to my friend to stay with him if her heart wasn't in the relationship. After they broke up we started seeing each other, admittedly it was almost immediately after. We kept it under the radar for months to spare his feelings, and I was eventually going to ask him for \"permission\"  to date her so we could go public (this whole thing made me realize how men really feel ownership over women).

I was originally apologetic, but eventually he starts making crazy demands. He says I have to break up with her if I want to stay friends with him, which just sounded ridiculous. I refuse, so then he demands to have both of us go to his place so he can speak to us individually. He really wanted to confront her and speak his piece, he seemed more angry at her than me. At this point his best friend is texting me too, saying basically the same stuff how I broke the code and I need to make reparations. I refuse all of it, I am absolutely not bringing her there to get screamed at.

We love each other to death and i just couldn't ask for a better, more caring, intelligent, beautiful and loving girlfriend (also she is hot af, like honestly a little over my league). She is the love of my life and she says I'm her's.\n\nA year before i met my current gf, I was ending things with another girl, the relationship lasted 3 years and was my first gf. The breakup was bad, she left me for another guy. Eventually i picked myself up and realized that she wasn't good for me at all, a very bad influence in my life, literally my life improved so much without her and never been happier! \n\nAfter all that i met my current gf and fell madly in love with each other. My ex texted me for a while (being with the guy she left me for) and my gf saw the texts ( btw i always was respectful and always kept answers short and sometimes didn't even reply) i honestly couldn't care less about her. But, since then my gf kinda suspects that i have some sort of lingering feelings for her, like something deep inside, but never had more issues after she saw the text she sended me and i explained it meant nothing to me, and since i didn't care i blocked her for respect out of my gf's wishes.\n\n Has to be taken into account that my gf hates my ex because of this.\n\nEverything's great for a year, but tonight... while eating dinner we were talking and outta literally nowhere i called my gf with my ex's name. I didn't even realized it at first, but the second that she changed her face i knew. I couldn't believe it. Her little face starting to cry broke me in a million pieces, she started saying that i always think of her and stuff like that. I kept trying to explain that i don't think of her and i had no idea why i said that (i try to put as much detail in this because i honestly don't know why that happened).\n\nWe argued for a while and left the restaurant. While in the car driving i kept telling her how sorry i am, and how much i love her. Also being honest about the fact that i dont talk with my ex and we dont follow each other on any social media. That i dont have any feelings for her and that she is the love of my life. She stopped crying after the restaurant, and had this poker face. I, by the other hand, started to panic like a 12 year old and had to pull over to catch my breath. \n\nBy the end she said it was just a mistake, and that it is hard for her and will still think about it but at the end it was just a mistake. I don't take that so easily, i kinda don't believe it. And im really concerned about where this is going. She was the one supporting me by the end lol.\n\nRight now i tried to call her, but she said she was too tired and wanted to sleep. So obviously the situation isn't quite alright like she claimed.\n\nHas this happened to anyone? \nHow should i handle this? What can i do? \nAm i exaggerating a little bit? Maybe too dramatic?\nShould i just pretend nothing happen next time i see her?\nI need serious advice.\n\nTL;DR: \nCalled my gf by my ex's name (don't know why bc i don't think about her), I'm feeling terrible but after a long talk and a panic attack i had she said it was just a mistake. The thing is: is it tho? I mean for her. I don't want to change how we are, I'm crazy about this girl.

I'm basically as high as I can go at my current job (I recently got promoted) and promotions are not going to happen any time soon due to how our department is structured. I'm also in a role where I'm not making the most out of my best skill set.\n\nI was contacted by a recruiter for a Seattle-based tech giant three weeks ago via LinkedIn. I interviewed with them and have made it to the third round of interviews and I have a feeling that an offer is coming soon based on the feedback.\n\nRecently, my wife got cold feet about the idea of moving to Seattle. We are both currently stagnated in our careers. When we were dating, she moved with me to our current city and left her job but made her a remote worker for that company. She has made comments of moving back to where we previously lived (her hometown) and getting her old job back and getting promoted there....but I do not want to go back there (farming community).\n\nI'm really not sure what to do. I feel like I owe her for sacrificing her career for me once, but I will not have a good job if we move back to her hometown. If we move to Seattle, my career makes a massive leap salary-wise and there is more personal satisfaction and opportunity.\n\nAdvice?\n\n\n**tl;dr**: Do we move to Seattle?

Could use some advice perhaps\n\nThe long version goes something like this. Essentially, I\u2019ve grown up in a somewhat poor household. This was mainly because my parents around my age were usually partying a lot and were living up their lives. My mom had dropped college I think due to her not having the money to do so and my dad going through college to work in some biology major. Anyway, they got engaged while this was going on and during said engagement, I was made. This in turn led to my dad ultimately dropping out both because it was a lot to weigh on his shoulders on top of the fact that with a child now to take care of, he didn\u2019t have the money to keep in college. Overall, despite being poor, I can\u2019t really complain about my life. Even if I wasn\u2019t always able to get everything I wanted, I still got the occasional cool gift like a game console or new video game I\u2019d been asking for. I remember school not really being that difficult for me apart from the bigger projects because I could never bring myself to focus on them when I was in elementary school. This was in part because I spent almost all my free time playing video games due to the fact that I couldn\u2019t have friends over because the house was messy or they didn\u2019t have the gas to come pick me up from their house. \n\nThis is what led me to become more introverted. I have a bunch of friends now, but it takes some pushing to make plans myself, though I\u2019m usually always down to go along if they make plans for say a meet up or whatever. As far as behavior, I\u2019ve never really disobeyed my parents deliberately before. At least not before I got into a relationship with a woman I met online. I was 20 and she is 18, fairly recent. After going through a few months after getting together in October 2020, we had really wanted to meet in person as we had met online. She lives a few hours away, but honestly it\u2019s not as bad as it could be. In January we did finally meet for the first time and it was absolutely amazing. \n\nWe got along so well, we had great chemistry, her family loves me, you name it. The issue is that my parents aren\u2019t very approving towards her because of the fact they don\u2019t see her as Christian. She says to me she is and she reads the Bible, wants to go to church with me, all that good stuff, but it\u2019s not enough to convince my parents. Today even I\u2019m planning on going to see her against my parents rule because it\u2019s something we\u2019d been planning for a month now. I really love this woman a ton. I\u2019ve never felt such a strong connection to a person than I have with her. Their main reasoning was that my car is old. It\u2019s a 2004 Chevy impala. I know it has some issues, but it\u2019s never stopped me from making the 2 hour trips from and to a college I went to and dormed at for a while. She lives about 5 hours away from my home. In any case, I know in doing this is gonna result in my parents likely adding restrictions on me once I get home such as taking my car off the insurance, which would mean I\u2019d likely have to start paying for my own, they\u2019d probably turn the internet off on my usage which would make finding a job, applying for a different college, etc a lot more difficult. I just have never felt so much like I wanted to go against the rules. I truly do wanna marry this woman. I love her more than words could describe, I love her family a ton too. They\u2019re really sweet people. I mean heck, her grandpa even said if anything happened to my car like say a breakdown or whatever he would help me out to pay for getting it fixed or even to get it back home to spare my dad of having to spend hundreds or even thousands to get it fixed or back to our home. Long story short, I\u2019m planning on leaving in roughly 2-3 hours today, so I suppose I\u2019ll check back on this later.

She told me I was the first boy to hold her hand, first boy to kiss her.\n\nI know where she lives, I've been in her house dozens of times, her parents both know me and like me.

For example, she posted a photo on social media and I left a comment with only a heart, nothing more. She deleted the comment, while some younger boys left a comment too with other emojis (fire, heart eyes, heart) and she didn't delete those. She told me it was childish of me to post a comment with a heart, but at the same time she posted some hearts on one of the younger boys' photo couple of days ago.\n\nAlso, she doesn't want to post a photo with us both on her social media, she doesn't want me to kiss her in public, she said because she is too shy for both of these.\n\nAlso note, my social media account is private, nobody can see my photos without following me (I have posted two photos with us both on my account).\n\nBecause of this I became mad, I said these things bother me, I said that \"I would liked a photo with us both on your social media\". I feel like she wants to hide me from somebody from her social media, but she isn't the type of girl who would cheat. She is very happy with me, she also said that.\n\nShe also has the biggest exam of her life in about 4 months from now (this is worth mentioning).\n\nAnd because of these multiple reasons, she said to me she wants to take a break.\n\nNow at this point I was upset, I cried, I was mad at myself, but I understood her decision and I said \"okay, I respect your decision\". The same day she told me she wanted a break, she sent me a goodnight text, 2 hours after her usual going to sleep time. I was confused at this point. I wasn't going to send her a message on her break before she sent me one (I read this on the internet, as it is my first serious relantionship).\n\nI spoke with her a little bit today, and I said \"sorry, I didn't want to message you on your break time, but I've heard you didn't feel too well\". I also said \"I won't send you messages anymore, but please let me say good night at least and ask you how you feel\". She said \"you're free to send whatever messages you want &lt;hugging emojis&gt;\". She also said \"it's okay to send messages\".\n\nAt this point, I'm very very confused.

Also after the honeymoon phase was over, I had a drastic change in career due to accident on the job, and I ended up relapsing due to me not being able to deal with it correctly, also I blame her for being overseas with her friends for a trip they planned before we even met, that was the first real instance I\u2019ve seen her blow me off when I needed her and I felt very alone.

He would just act upset whenever he was and it was on me to get it out of him. There were many incidents where I could tell he was upset and it was on me to get him to open up. I felt like I was carrying both of us. I had a rough time with some health issues last year and didn't really like myself, I struggled a lot and didn't feel like having sex all of a sudden while we were quarantined together. This really highlighted the fact that it was only me doing the caretaking, as he really didn't rise to the occasion. I started feeling like I needed to be taken care of and supported and I communicated with him that I was no longer interested in getting him to talk and he needed to share. He needed to reconnect with friends or something as it had just hit me I was his whole world. I communicated a lot. At the end, it felt like I was nagging for simply having to repeat so many realistic things and I started disliking myself around him. That, coupled with a few really bad occasions that we had (one related to consent in bed which he refused to admit, and another where I was at a friend's preparing for a flight and had received horrible news and called him crying to come be with me, he was 40 minutes away and simply said \"what's me coming over gonna change?\") \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat, along with everything else, made it really hard to move on. I tried addressing these incidents separately but it AGAIN took a lot of explaining for me to get a small sorry and nothing really about how he's gonna address his behavior rather than isolated incidents. I felt like I couldn't trust him anymore to be relied on when he didn't know how to be there for me during my hard times, when he acted fussy when I didn't wanna have sex but never really admitted how much it bothered him, when he abandoned me while I was crying. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this will come across as one-sided but I really did take care of him, a lot. A hell lot. I was his rock but he wasn't mine. I was away at home when I started talking to people about how I was feeling and everyone agreed it was supposed to end because I was obviously so hurt and disappointed to salvage it. I remember really reflecting a lot before I ended it and what's funny is I ended it on a time when he was doing one of his I'm gonna act mad but I'm gonna say there's nothing wrong until you ask me 500 times so I was like you know what this needs to end and we had a good conversation and he said he'd be there for me if I needed him because he knew he was the only one who knew about my health situation. The thing is before we ended things, I had met someone who was very clearly interested through a friend group. I kept chatting to them but knew things had to be officially wrapped up with my ex before I could do anything, so we were only texting and nothing romantic but I'm not stupid I knew what it was, it was probably 2 weeks while I knew things were over I just didn't really was finding the right time to end them from a distance. I fucked up by letting the two things overlap and not breaking up with him sooner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we broke up he stalked me a lot and I guess he noticed something seemed fishy, there was nothing ever explicit as me and the other guy literally only 3 three dates and we never really even officially called them that and then it was over. But he sensed a vibe. Months later my ex messaged me to apologize and take responsibility for a lot of the MAJOR things that I needed closure on. I was starving for him to apologize and acknowledge a lot of my feelings and trauma that I got very emotional and we had a couple long phone conversations just to seemingly catch up but there was obviously still feelings there on both ends. He was offended I wanted to stay in touch and didn't understand and said it must be easier for me than it is for him. One time during one of those heartfelt conversations he asked me if I cheated on him, and I really just wanted to be true to him and give him closure so I told him it wasn't like that and told him exactly what happened. He snapped and told me I was lying. He calmed down and we continued chatting and hung up on a positive note. Next morning he blocked me on everything. I felt hurt and like the closure I got was fake but I really want to see things from his perspective. I texted him on his number saying first I was upset and how dare you but then calming down and saying I was sorry and I understand I fucked up too and he needed to do whatever to process it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThing is it's hard to move on, I check if I'm still blocked every day and I do feel bitter than it took me one mistake to be thrown aside like this after I stuck by his side all this time.

Will he unblock me ever? Is he even worth the thought? I don't know how to process this situation and I need insight as it seemed when we broke up it was first him who struggled to move on and now it's me and he's not even accessible. This feels strange because I have never EVER struggled to get over someone but also wanted to get back together with them. For some reason, after he apologized and took responsilibty for things I realized that that's all I needed from him, I know he did it once and didn't show a pattern but that was enough for me to want to try again. Me wanting to try again with someone after it's over is a new thing for me and it makes me thing that he's the one as stupid as that sounds but I feel like I won't ever feel this again because it hasn't happened before where I missed someone after I got over them.

I don\u2019t know if I have feelings fit this girl, and even if I do, I don\u2019t know how to tell her, and I\u2019m not sure she\u2019d even give a shit to be honest.  Maybe I just really don\u2019t want to lose her as a friend.  Whatever the case, I just don\u2019t know what to do here.  I should also mention that when our group hangs out, I\u2019m usually the one to plan stuff, at least the last couple times, so I really don\u2019t want to be pushy and make people who don\u2019t want to hang out do that.

I've been with my girlfriend for just over two years. I think the world of her, have always told the truth and been loyal (she would disagree, as I previously liked Instagram pictures of a girl I had met on holiday before we got together, or pictures of girls I've been really good totally platonic friends with in revealing clothes). I am being completely honest, because potentially I plan on showing her this. Aside from meaningless likes on pictures of girls I know very well, or have at least met and shared friendly relations with, I've been totally committed and faithful to her. Never even told her a white lie, I believe honesty is always the best policy and a trust builder. But she disagrees with me as she makes accusations against my intentions that I can't disprove. Things I can't prove so she holds against me. We patched up the above issues regarding the liking of pictures, I bowed down and agreed to let her remove all girls she deemed pretty from my social media. She now admits this was overboard, she's struggling with mental health/anxiety.\n\nRecently, a girl I'd been out with on a couple of occasions for drinks in a group setting (before me and my gf got together) messaged me out of the blue. I'll admit, me and this girl had intentions of possibly sleeping together when we first met but it never happened. She messaged me to see what I'm up to these days and why I ended up ghosting her, I clearly stated \"well we both got in relationships\". This girl could see my recent uploads with my girlfriend. She pursued me, clearly interested in going further by hearting everything and stating \"I'm single\". At this point I told my girlfriend (30 minutes since I received the 1st message) as I couldn't face her without letting her know, my gf insisted on replying for me and said \"well I'm not single as I've been with my gf for 2 years and very happy\". I thought that was the end of it, I thought I'd been loyal and a decent boyfriend. I thought this was trust building. Well..\n\nIt pissed my gf off that I'd replied at all. So much so that she has admitted tonight she soon after searched for an old friend on snapchat who she used to play xbox games with (call him bob), to add him, but she accidentally added this different guy by the same name (bob) who had interviewed her for a job a year ago. They had a catch up, sending back and forth messages relating to him now being a PT and her looking to get active again (something I've encouraged a lot until she got angry at me putting pressure on her) - I have a sports background. They had a really friendly chat, almost pretty unnecessary considering they don't know each other aside from one job interview, they both were sending emojis like poking tongues out, cutesie stuff, and this guy was quite eager to train her. Inviting her for one on one PT sessions at no cost, I'll concede that she did tell him about her partner (Me), but that didn't stop him asking to go for coffee, then again insisting to 'drag' her out the house. She ignored both those messages. She had a snapchat conversation with him before which has expired obviously, I've never seen it. She insists this got is 'disgusting' so why have a lengthy convo with him?\n\nAm I an asshole? I feel betrayed she would entertain a conversation for so long with this randomer she doesn't know who's clearly hitting on her. I feel like the trust has been broken or am I overreacting? I was so trusting in her before, I never worried too much about her messaging guys apart from on an odd occasion I'd ask who she's speaking to. She keeps getting annoyed at me and saying it's basically equal to what I did in messaging a girl I kind of know, to say hello back and how are you? then my second message was clearly referencing my gf. The third was my girlfriends reply on my behalf. And then I never spoke to her again. She does not see eye to eye with me, I'm angry her situation with this guy escalated the way it did and it took far longer for me to see the full details and story as I was angry at the double standard of her being allowed to message randomers in the first place. This might be a nuke for me. She's my world, but I don't trust she feels the same way for me anymore. This guy is some juiced up bodybuilder btw. Some input would be really appreciated, thanks. I feel like I'm being fed bullshit.\n\nTL;DR - My girlfriend has been messaging a guy who interviewed her for a job a year ago.

We\u2019re always on and off and it\u2019s been hard for us to trust eachother because of some bumps in the road.

I\u2019m not perfect at all and I know I\u2019ve made some mistakes in our relationship but I feel like i have always been the glue in our relationship because I have always been the one to fight for our relationship and the only one who tried to actively fix issues between us even if I wasn\u2019t the one at fault (I\u2019m just trying to provide a little background context before i talk about the main issue) there have been times where we broke up and didn\u2019t speak for at least a month and it would always tear me apart and it seemed like no big deal to him.

We\u2019ve just gone through a lot in the past but for the last few months we have gotten so much better and we have made so much progress in our relationship. We\u2019ve started to communicate better and learned how to love each other properly and all that good stuff. This past weekend I just flew to his home town and officially met his best friends and family after over a year of us being together and I really had the best time of my life spending time with him. Despite all the bs we\u2019ve bs endured and all the mistakes him and I have made, he truly is the love of my life and I just feel like I\u2019ve never loved someone this much before. Not everybody in my life agreed with me staying with him after some of the things he\u2019s done but I feel like no matter what he did, I always found myself forgiving him and trying to understand why he did whatever it was he did. I\u2019m not completely proud of being so naive when it comes to him but I\u2019m just so deeply in love with him I managed to work past whatever problem was thrown at us. Now on to the meat of our situation.....\nWe sort of just got back together a few months ago after a month of not speaking and ever since then he\u2019s been trying to go through my phone and just dig through all of my stuff for whatever reason. He would randomly snatch my phone and run, lock himself in the bathroom with my phone, go through my MacBook or my Apple Watch while i was asleep, Just anything that had messages on it. Even in our past he would go through my things to find anything. I\u2019m not allowed anywhere near his phone and I\u2019ve actually never went through any of his things so I\u2019ve expressed to him that I don\u2019t appreciate him trying to go through my things ALL THE TIME especially when he knew he was hiding things in his phone so i felt that it was wrong of him to be trying to dig up dirt on me. So yesterday i let him borrow my iPad for class and of course he dug so deep that he found somethings from   Last summer that I said to a friend about wanting to get with someone else. At this point we weren\u2019t speaking nor were we together but I understand why he\u2019s upset. He feels as though i was willing to pick someone else over him. I completely understand why he feels that way but I feel like that was something in the past that I never even really acted on. It was a conversation between a friend and i. So because of that he wants absolutely nothing to do with me anymore and said he doesn\u2019t wanna be with me anymore. He won\u2019t even talk to me about the situation and has completely just dropped me without any type of conversation or a real explanation. Even though when I\u2019ve caught him red handed, I\u2019ve always always always given him the chance to talk to me regardless of how upset i was but this man has just completely dropped me. I feel sick to my stomach about this and I don\u2019t think I can go on without him.

I tried to encourage her by saying that there's always a next time and also opportunities outside of school to play but she was still cut about the situation. I tried to distract her from it by asking her about her work and my usual silliness over a facetime call. Most of the time it helps her cope with it. But this time, she was still upset and I didn't know how to help. She said I didn't understand, which was mostly true, but I could still imagine how she would be feeling.\n\nI've had this problem for a while and she has told me just be there for her. But I don't know what to do. I ask her how she's feeling and try to get her to think in the way that I would, in the hopes that she would understand how I would cope with something like this since it works for me. My way would be to think about the situation from a 'okay its done, what now?' sorta thing. As in, it's over, what can I do from now. I also play volleyball and so my approach was play with friends outside school, join clubs, wait for uni, that sort of thing. Sometimes this approach works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nOver the last few years, I've really been trying to understand other people's emotions. For me, it had always been:  \n1. Person has problem  \n2. I fix problem  \n3. Person has nothing to be upset about so problem solved.  \nI learnt that this was not the case for most people a while ago and so I've been trying to validate people's emotions. So like when she tells me this stuff, she sometimes say she doesn't expect me to understand. I say I do, how she must feel and that sorta stuff to try to make sure she knows she's being understood. And I try to save advice for after that. Feelings come first is something that I've learnt.\n\nAgain, she says for me to be there for her. We stay on facetime but I just feel like absolute shit because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I try to get her to not think about her problems too much. Obviously, I have to get her to face the truth to a certain degree but I don't want it to overwhelm her. So after going through the situation with her, I'll try to get her to accept it (she doesn't have to) and I'll just try to get her to think about other things by talking about other stuff. Again, sometimes this works, sometimes this doesn't I just find it a little difficult because she is very emotionally-driven against my logic-driven view.\n\ntl;dr - I have trouble comforting and supporting my girlfriend when she is upset/sad/frustrated/etc. I don't know what to do or say.

I know I\u2019m younger but I do feel like I have good advice to help her. She mainly doesn\u2019t accept it though and does play victim a lot. It\u2019s got to the point now where I dread calls with her and when her messages pop up I know it will be a drain of energy. I love my sister dearly but it\u2019s starting to get a bit too much. She has been to counselling but has stopped due to her work rotation. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I have moments of guilt of feeling like this. I want to enjoy the rest of my pregnancy and get try and be calm and not get that bitterness every time I speak to her. \n\nI can\u2019t help but feel selfish but I\u2019m trying my best to not get super anxious and tight chested every time we chat, and I always feel \u201c doom\u201d after a conversation for her, which obviously isn\u2019t good for the baby too.

This has been fine for me because all of the other, more practical things, a person wants from marriage are all things my fianc\u00e9 can provide. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 had an employee who I\u2019ll call \u201cMia\u201d. She was his assistant for almost 3 years until she quit a month ago. When she was his assistant, she was with him a lot so when I went to see him at work, I would also see her. It was very obvious from the first time I saw them interact that my fianc\u00e9 was sexually attracted to her. I made a comment about it when she was out of earshot and he didn\u2019t deny it but instead said he didn\u2019t do his employees.\n\nAnother thing is that my fianc\u00e9 is a very strict boss, but he was always very lenient with Mia. He claimed it was because he didn\u2019t want to deal with the hassle of training a new assistant again but his sister, who works for him, even said the way he treated her compared to his old assistants was like night and day. The one thing she told me that really stood out was when they had a very busy month at work and he offered her \u201cas much time off as she needed\u201d when her mother became ill so she could go be with her, even though it caused a massive headache for himself. He never would\u2019ve done that for anyone else. \n\nAlso, my fiance seemed more relaxed and at ease whenever she was around, and after she quit he has continued to keep in touch with her and has offered to help her get her dream job, which is all really out of character for him.\n\nThere were other small things, but I don\u2019t want to make the post too long.\n\nUntil recently, I always believed he just wanted to have sex with her but I made a joke that he could sleep with her without worrying now that she had quit and he got surprisingly angry at me and said he couldn\u2019t do that to her. When I asked him if he was in love with her, he said he didn\u2019t believe in love. He\u2019s said the same thing in the past, but this was the first time it didn't sound convincing.\n\nI\u2019ve never even considered breaking up with him before, but a part of me thinks that the only reason he hasn\u2019t tried to pursue things with Mia is because of our engagement and how it would make him look if he breaks things off with me. Our families both have a vested interest in our marriage, and I know his father\u2019s opinion is the most important thing to him and he wouldn\u2019t do anything to jeopardise it. I also know my own family are going to be angry at me if I do break things off with him, so I want to make sure I\u2019m doing the right thing.\n\nHow can I figure out if he is in love with her or if it really was just residual sexual tension that\u2019s made him act weird? Also, is ending things for a potential scenario completely insane? The pandemic has made me think of things differently and I don\u2019t know if this is just me making a hasty decision because of how the world is right now.\n\nI also want to make it clear that I\u2019m 100% not having cold feet about marrying him. If I didn\u2019t believe he was in love with her, I wouldn\u2019t even be considering this. \n\nTL;DR \u2013 I believe my fianc\u00e9 is in love with his former assistant as there was an obvious attraction between the two and he treated her MUCH better than any of his old assistants. Also, as we have an open relationship, I jokingly suggested he sleep with her and his reaction was very out of character for him.", "title": "I (29F) believe my fianc\u00e9 (30M) is in love with his former employee (27F)."}, {"created_utc": 1615980003, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m6y6e9/i_am_the_only_one_who_thinks_dating_isnt_worth/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I am the only one who thinks dating isn't worth anymore?"}, {"created_utc": 1615979951, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m6y5y8/help_m19_f20_me/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Help m(19) f(20) me"}, {"created_utc": 1615979811, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m6y4p5/how_to_create_boundaries_with_my_23f_sister_29f/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "How to create boundaries with my (23F) sister (29F) without being horrible"}, {"created_utc": 1615979681, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m6y3ch/for_those_that_fell_in_love_again_after_35did_it/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "For those that fell in love (again) after 35,did it feel as intense and exciting as when you were younger?"}, {"created_utc": 1615979503, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m6y1l6/how_would_you_feel_if_a_girl_told_you_that_she_is/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "How would you feel if a girl told you that she is willing convert her religion for you?"}, {"created_utc": 1615979434, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m6y0ta/my_22f_husband_26m_started_video_chatting_with/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "Yesterday my husband called his friend because he saw that his friend was hanging out with slutty and POSSIBLY lightly dressed girls on Snapchat (I never saw them, but it was obvious by the way my husband and his friend were talking about the girls that they weren\u2019t good innocent girls).

I'm scared she will die before this is resolved.\n\nI have two sisters, Cinderella and Ariel. Grandma has always favored Cinderella, ever since we were children.  It was never as obvious as it has been the last few years though. I feel like Cinderella and Ariel get all her affection and I'm an afterthought.\n\nCinderella has to be needed by people. Ever since our Mom died, she has decided to be grandma's personal assistant. She visits often,  they talk on the phone almost daily, does errands for her, etc. Cinderella and Ariel both have children, who Grandma dotes upon, and I don't have children  yet. I feel like if I had children, Grandma would try harder to have a relationship with me. Ariel is not as close to her as Cinderella, but I do know Grandma reaches out to her often. I'm not supposed to know Grandma has given Ariel a lot of money over the years, but I do (some info from Ariel, some from Cinderella). \n\nI will admit, I have never visited as often as the others. I was making a point to call twice a month, and before covid I would visit once a month. However, every single interaction is because I reached out to her - whether it is calling or visiting. She has called me once in over a year - my birthday. She has my phone number written down, she knows it. It is also not a memory issue - she calls Cinderella at the same time every day. She is also aware if I don't answer, I check my messages and return the call later on. \n\nHere's the main issue. I called on her birthday, got her answering machine. I left a message saying happy birthday and to give me a call when she had a minute. She never returned my call. She didn't call me on Christmas or New Years. At this point, I'm hurt and I haven't called her either. It's been over 2 months. Cinderella and I had a fight in October and we aren't talking right now. Whether accurate or not, I feel like Grandma has chosen a side, and I lost.

He has not really done consistent therapy and makes zero attempts to actually do this even though we've talked about it over and over again. I think he might believe he doesn't need it. We've done couples therapy also to work out problems especially involving his parents and their behavior. We've been together for 5 years, our kids are 2.5yrs old. \n\nHe is currently upset about losing some money in stocks although he is still ahead from his initial investment. We talked many times that the stock market is volatile and its always a risk. He wants to be financially independent. I get it. But I also am a realist that we will likely need to work for a reasonable amount of time before retiring. We both make good incomes and we have 2 young children which we would like to set up college funds soon. He gets really worked up about this financial independence but it also feels like he is somewhat impatient. When he was younger he skipped around careers a lot. He has only been working in his current field for 5 years and he said he is burned out already. But I don't think he is burned out from work bc he gets plenty of time off work, I think he's burned out by life. He didn't like me saying this and said I'm not supporting him and I wouldn't understand bc I'm not in the same profession. My job is different yes but I do work more hours than him, but I also take on much more childcare responsibilities as well as most of the domestic duties like cooking and cleaning. I do this so he can have more time to do the things that he chooses, take naps, read, trade stocks, etc. It is my way to support him. I got really annoyed today when he accused me of not being supportive when I try to be in every capacity. I'm tired and exhausted too, I'm a mom of twin toddlers and I work more than 40hrs/week. He never has to take care of the kids alone, we also have a nanny during the week while I'm working. He works 3 days a week, 12he shifts, sometimes these days end up being on my day off so I am taking care of the kids alone.\n\nI think he isn't coping well with a number of things and he's never been good at coping with not getting what he wants. He's upset about not havign any friends since we moved across the country just a few months before covid, so we haven't really been able to make friends. He has one that lives here and they work together. I have none here, I also work 100% remotely so I only see coworkers on video calls. Unfortunately this is the nature of the pandemic, and I accept that it's temporary. He also hates that we don't have a home to call our own, but we moved here 1.5yrs ago so we are still renting and trying to figure out which city we want to settle down in. He's also upset that none of our family is willing to visit or make effort to make visits happen considering we moved across the country to be closer to them. They now live a few hours within driving distance.\n\nThese external factors are unchangeable at the moment and I'm getting weary taking on much of the burden of everything else. Sometimes I just want to keep my happy go lucky mood which is normally how I am but when he has his cloud of doom, my mood quickly goes down. I try to cheer him up or get him to see that our life isn't that bad and as time goes by it will get better (vaccinations and reopening, save money and eventually buy a house, eventually make friends, etc) but it doenst do a lot. In fact, I would argue that our life is pretty good but he is constantly dissatisfied by things if they aren't going exactly as he pictured. This is a chronic problem and I worry that he will never be happy and content.\n\nI suggested he find a psychologist that specializes in his issues but he brushed it off and he won't pursue it bc he never has. In the past I have had to make appointments for him but honestly I don't think therapy works unless you actually think you have a problem and you tell the therapist the truth. So I am at the point of what am I supposed to do as his spouse bc I really don't know. Any thoughts?

He moved from his dorm into my apartment. Almost 2 months in, problems are arising, namely:\n\n* My boyfriend is busy with work and studies, I'm fine with getting less attention, but it gets tiring. I work in an office and come home to him in front of his computer, tensed up and hardly moving. He stays in front of his computer till late at night. He would be in discord with his project mates **at late hours**, which makes me angry- I have to get up early for work and he's disturbing my sleep. He in turn argues that he doesn't have any other time to do that, I have to be understanding. He says he compromises by sleeping at 12 with me, otherwise, he'd stay even later.\n* Again with his busyness: He doesn't really do many **chores**. I have to clean up- an often shitty toilet, stained bathtub, floors everywhere, load the washing machine, etc. He helps me with cooking, cutting up ingredients and such, which I'm grateful for, I leave him some dishes to wash during the day. He washes dishes- it becomes his main argument that he does contribute to our living. His phrasing also angers me- somehow he's *Helping* me, but not doing what he *Should* do, since he lives here too.\n* He's annoyed with my **cat**. Because he works at home all day, my cat's loud mewing gets on his nerves. She also sheds a lot of hair and likes to jump on every surface of the house possible. He thinks I should train her because her habits are unhygienic. I agree- but it's a 5 yr old cat who has a hard time being taught. I can see that he's not fond of her. My cat is very important to me, and seeing his resentment towards an animal hurts me.\n* He refuses to simply **empathize** with me. Everything becomes a debate, where I have to come up with arguments to convince him of the validity of my feelings. For example, he considers my career not promising. When I expressed my hurt over this comment, he asked me to convince him the opposite with arguments. I simply don't want him being so blunt, he could at least care about my feelings(?\n\nI'd consider myself a sensitive person, and all of these things have been weighing on me. I no longer feel bubbly about our newfound way of living, it all just feels unfair....\n\nAre these concerns valid? Or am I simply required to compromise more?

If I leave a room without bringing my cup with me, that cup will no longer exist for me. If I switch focus or tasks, I'll forget my train of thought or what I was doing if it wasn't particularly involved or important. Sometimes I'll forget to do small tasks that don't have any impact(forgetting to sweep or mop). Admittedly, it can be quite annoying. I've been working on this, because my boyfriend is the one who's had to remind me of these things and it frustrates him endlessly. This used to be a much more regular occurrence, him having to remind me of small things, but I've really worked on being more deliberate and committing things to memory to do later, or bringing my dishes with me if I leave a room so I don't forget to pick them up, and creating to do lists to track what I need to get done, no matter how minor. I still occasionally have things slip my mind, but it happens once a week at most, and often less than that if I'm not stressed or preoccupied.\n\nThe issue is that my partner has lately gotten significantly more frustrated with my flightiness. I've been like this since we started dating, and I think he maybe found it charming then? But we started living together two years ago, and his frustration has escalated since then, despite my efforts to improve. I understand that it's frustrating if somebody leaves an empty cup behind, or a broom in a room after they've finished sweeping, and when I'm alerted to doing so, I apologize and pick it up. Over the past nine months, however, he's started yelling and swearing at me for these mishaps. He'll get really annoyed, and after yelling at me to pick up, ignore me or throw the fact that this is something I struggle with in my face when I apologize. He's recently been telling me how immature it is that I can't remember. I don't purposely do these things, and I certainly don't do them maliciously, so I understandably get upset. I've recently been more vocal about his responses, and have repeatedly told him that he can feel how he's feeling, and that's valid and fine, but that I don't deserve to be spoken to so disrespectfully (I don't mean an authoritative respect, I mean a respect you show your loved one when talking to them) and that him swearing or being aggressive is not something I respond well to. If someone has an issue with something I've done, I prefer a plain explanation of what they had a problem with and how it made them feel. This really helps me to figure out what I can do to avoid situations like that in the future.\n\n In this instance, though, while I understand that his frustrations have compounded over time, I still don't think I deserve to be treated this way. My flightiness has never resulted in a potentially dangerous outcome, or resulted in missing something important, it's always over minor things- forgetting to pick up a conversation when I come back from doing laundry, leaving a cup behind, forgetting to put away a broom. I've never directly or indirectly hurt anyone either, and I've actively worked to reduce these incidents, but I feel like the tiniest things set him off. He's never mentioned any reason as to why my forgetfulness is so infuriating. I've told him that while I'm working on being better about these things, I will likely always have an element of this to me that will crop up from time to time. I've started getting very frustrated that he continues to treat me this way and then gets more upset when I tell him I don't deserve to be treated in this manor and tells me I'm making him apologize when I'm the one at fault. I've told him I don't expect an apology, just that he change how he's speaking to me because it's upsetting and frazzles me, and sometimes is a bit scary.

He had a girlfriend nearly the whole time and I was floating around people like usual and figuring out my sexuality. A few months into the pandemic I had just gotten out of a really bad place and had fully leaned into my sexuality and embraced myself overall, basically super excited to start living my truth I guess. Around this same time, his girlfriend dumped him and I found out she was super emotionally abusive. In the next few weeks reconnecting with him as a friend and trying to comfort him we caught feelings for each other, and after a few weeks of me avoiding a status, I agreed to be in an actual relationship.\n\nThe only way we really knew how to interact the whole time we were friends was in a very broish way if that makes sense, and it was kind of a problem a few months in since I couldn't lose that playful aggressiveness when talking to him. We had a few arguments over moral conflicts here and there but besides that we have been in essentially a \"honeymoon phase\" for maybe 7 months.

I know he's also aware of this, but he doesn't act like it very often and I know that he genuinely is so deeply in love with me because I have tried so hard to soften and be consistent for him.\n\nI feel very suffocated because I always knew I wasn't really fit for a relationship considering I can't keep any other serious attachments for very long, but it is becoming incredibly difficult for me to be an individual and live as I see fit while also trying to make him happy and be the person he needs in his life. He's very clingy, which I appreciate but I need space very often and (while I try my best to comfort and love him as often as I can) I'm starting to get very irritated with him but bury it very deeply so as to not hurt his feelings and make him try to change who he is for me. It is just becoming extremely apparent that while we have otherwise been in a pretty healthy relationship, I don't know if the love is there anymore or if the way we live our lives is just too different for us to be romantically involved.\n\nI know that the best and healthiest option here is to tell him the truth, but the past week he has been extremely affectionate to an almost overbearing extent and he keeps talking about how excited he is to spend our first full summer together. He's also not doing too hot lately and his birthday is coming up, and I literally cannot imagine how evil it would be to tell him that at this moment.\n\nI still love him very dearly and want him to be happy and want to keep this closeness but I know that I cannot continue satisfying him in this relationship without sacrificing my own mental health, plus it would be lying to him. I would recommend a break to him as well, just to see if maybe I get over it but I know he would be deeply hurt and not see me the same. I feel like I'm forgetting details but this is already a very long post I think and I basically just cannot think of any good move to make here without breaking his heart.

From long distance \u2014&gt; living together. We\u2019ve come... a *long* way. Pun intended. No, we didn\u2019t jump to living together. I lived in the same city on my own, then we moved in together after 2 years.\n\nThe issue: Love the man, but he can\u2019t handle his stress in a way that allows him to just \u201cbreathe\u201d and I can\u2019t keep being his emotional camel.\n\nContext:\n\nBF is an overachieving, intelligent, hilarious dude. I love him with all I have and I don\u2019t have a lot to give, which I feel bad about already.\n\nI come from a background where my family didn\u2019t talk about mental health and I was told to keep it to myself so I didn\u2019t embarrass myself, or my family. Over the years, through a ton of therapy and tough love from my parents, friends, and eventually BF, I am now still a *very* stressed person, but I have no issue admitting that. I am more of a \u201cgo with the flow\u201d individual and it\u2019s tough, but I\u2019ve learned not everything is in my control and I can\u2019t control that.\n\nBF came from a family that handled everything: money, school, friends, family. Our worlds surprisingly mesh very well and we enjoy being with both sides. He didn\u2019t have many \u201cstressful\u201d factors, in comparison to mine. I don\u2019t like to compare, but I will say we had different \u201cstressful factors\u201d that we responded to. As an adult, it hit him like a train. Growing up is hard and his stress levels are through the roof, and I\u2019m one of the few people he trusts to be vulnerable with when talking about these difficult feelings.\n\nHowever.\n\nIt hurts because nothing I say or do will change anything. I offer advice, when asked, and he\u2019s bitter/sad/hurt by how blunt it can come off as or/and it\u2019s not the answer he wanted.\n\nIf I say nothing, he feels like a burden and wishes he never said anything. Sometimes, I feel like he just needs someone to listen and not fix anything.\n\nIf I do a combo of both, he panics. He realizes he\u2019s in the deep end of anxiety. Suddenly, he breaks and I have to pick up the pieces. It\u2019s really scary having to hold him until he calms down, or wait until he\u2019s calm to even go near him. It can take minutes to hours and it\u2019s a tense situation.\n\nMy problem: It\u2019s become hard to manage. I am so stressed by my own life, where I\u2019m a leader in every aspect. I want to be there for my partner, as I have been, but my emotional capacity is drained and I even find myself wanting to sleep on the couch or watch a movie to avoid sleeping and wondering if tomorrow will be a better day.\n\nI wake up to him most mornings now hoping something in him won\u2019t push him to the edge. I love him, I really do, but I\u2019m not emotionally strong enough (yet) to hold *all* of his stress on my shoulders. He regrets telling me sometimes, but I know he trusts me enough to open up and I do not want to shatter that.\n\nI\u2019m just tired..\n\nTL;DR - BF (21M) is a very stressed out person, always on the edge of panic attacks or episodes.

This is my first time asking for help here but I'm out of options. \n\nTo preface, I've known this girl for well over a year now. Over that time, we became very close friends. The two of us ended up in a friend group. There are four individuals total. It is also important to note we are all in college. This friend group was important to all of us and we spent much of last year together. Over time, there were plenty of instances of this girl and I being alone together. We grew closer and starting dating close to the end of last year. This was the first relationship for both of us. To my knowledge, things went extremely well while we were dating. It felt natural and truly good. The only reservation was one concerning the group. We didn't tell the other two as she didn't want added pressure from them. I was personally against this but she was anxious enough that I conceded.   \n\nUpon winter break, we all went our separate ways. Our respective homes are far apart, so group activities were placed on a hiatus for that time. I continued to talk to her: calls, messages, etc. Close to the end of the year, I got a message from her. She said in it that she thought it was a bad idea for us to date. She said she didn't think it was right and that it was too complicated. She also said that I was one of her closest friends and that she didn't want that to be messed up. Lastly, she mentioned how she didn't want to alter the group dynamic. All I could saw was that I was disappointed as this completely caught me off guard. The relationship had effectively lasted two months.\n\nWinter break ended and everyone went back to college. On the first week, I met with her in person for the first time of the year. I talked with her about her reasoning and she essentially said what I already detailed above. I wasn't quick enough and didn't mention how the fear of altering the group dynamic made no sense. Especially since we are college students. What are the actual odds that it can be maintained after graduation? It's been almost two months since the start of the semester and this once tightly knit group has only fully gotten together twice. This girl, she's historically had a hard time making friends. Hence why she wants to maintain the group and our existing relationship. Truthfully, it feels like she wants to try to roll everything back to the way it was before we started dating. The other two members of the friend group still don't know about this. To my knowledge at least.   \n\nI'm expected to stay for the sake of the group. I still care deeply about this girl and I don't want to hurt her. If I leave the group, I not only hurt her but I also damage the two other friendships. However, it's hard for me to bring my old self to the group. I'm quiet instead and interact barely. It's hard for me to be in the room with them since I'm just reminded that I had to give up a relationship for this. Call me selfish but I can't deny myself. They've all noticed. The girl, she's asked me repeatedly what's wrong. I can't answer truthfully. I'm not sure if that would be the best idea. It kinda amazes me that she doesn't seem to be aware of what's going on with me. It almost feels naive. I've also been busy enough that I can use work as an excuse to avoid any discomfort. \n\nOver the past few weeks the two of us have somehow ended up alone occasionally. Just like old times. It feels bittersweet now for some reason. The vexing part is that she talks to me of deeply personal issues and obviously still holds me highly. I feel cheated and teased. It's like I'm being taunted. \"See how close you can get to her, but you'll never be as close as you want.\" I can't help but think of Tantalus. The reason why I feel pinched is that I don't want to leave the group. I already mentioned this but I would hurt too many people. I especially don't want to hurt her. However, being around her is often frustrating for me and I have a hard time not thinking about this. The only time I can escape it is when I'm working.\n\nWhat should I do here? I am doing something wrong? I feel that a ridiculous mistake has been made and it bothers me to no end. I've spent way too much time thinking about this and I just want some sort of rest. \n\n**TL;DR** One of my closest friends who I was dating broke up with me for some strange reasons relating to a friend group we are in.

We really do love each so we love being able to spend time together, cuddle, make out, etc. whenever we want.

I am an early riser and he aspires to be so me waking him up every morning  works well. In many ways things are great.\n* The issue though is values. He doesn't believe in intercourse before marriage. If it were not for circumstances, he wouldn't even agree moving in. So we are outwardly a couple that lives together, and we sleep in the same bed, we have not actually had sex. This is causing issues cause I want to move forward and grow in intimacy and I think he is being, for the lack of a better word, prudish and stupid - holding onto archaic values on a weird personal pride thing\n* On the other hand, he wants us to get married and has been trying to get me to go ahead. He feels that since we get along really well and love each other we should get married, especially since we are living together anyways. But I believe it is important to wait and really know the person before marriage. I cannot conceive proposing / accepting a proposal unless I have dated someone for at least 2 years. Especially since my sister rushed into an engagement that did not go well.

But he says he just doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with anybody, he just wants to be alone. He wants to be able to hang out with his friends without having to ask permission from me. And for him to do whatever he wants. Within these last 2 years, I have never met a single friend of his. Meanwhile, his ex-gf has met his friends. I was never introduced to anyone. After being said all this to my face, I was humiliated. I have some integrity for myself. I let it be. I left and never looked back. It wasn't til the next day, he texted me and our conversation went like this:\n\n2/23: Ex-bf \"I've been thinking a lot about what you said, and still thinking and processing everything. I definitely do need professional help and I think we each would need to see a therapist and also see a therapist together.\"\n\nMy response: \" Glad to hear that you are going forward with therapy.

You asked me if I love you, yes I do. I didn\u2019t hesitate to think about that. And we talked about how we always end up back with each other and something attracts us back to each other. I know on my part I should communicate a lot more but also it\u2019s hard for me to really feel what I\u2019m feeling and put it into words.. my problem is that I dont communicate enough with you so keeping everything in builds up and it just act on something without thinking about it.\n\n2/27 - So do you not want to talk about this and just let everything go?\n\n2/28 - \\*Called and texted\\* Can we plz talk?\n\nOn 2/28, my niece died from a major car accident on the interstate, along with the nanny and car driver.

What we saved for is now closed. \n\nThe one person I wish I could talk to and hold is still my ex. I love him deeply and honestly, I don't think I will ever love again. I know people tell me, one day you'll find the right person in your life. But I saw it with him. I'm sure he saw it with me too. But he pushes me away every time.

This whole ordeal resurfaced after he saw me about to post a picture of us saying happy anniversary and in return him saying he wasn\u2019t going to post anything. Throughout our relationship, we\u2019ve both used social media regularly. I do post more often than him, but he\u2019s definitely not the type of person that doesn\u2019t post at all or rarely posts like once every 2-3 years. He also browses social media everyday for about 3-4 hours max.\nHe\u2019s posted about almost everything important in his life, from his family, to his friends, to his hobbies, etc. Everything except his girlfriend of half a decade, aka me.\n\nI have communicated my feelings of insecurity about it to him more than once, but it always get met with the same reasoning, which IMO does not match up with his social media habits.

However, this has been bothering me for a while and makes me think he\u2019s hiding me or not proud to be with me. I guess adding onto those feelings is the fact that I caught him on a dating app on multiple occasions a couple months ago. He apologized and I decided to forgive him. We also got into an argument recently and I found out he was posting on his Instagram stories with a special close friends list setting that he purposely excluded me from out of anger, so that I couldn\u2019t see what he was posting. He did end up adding me onto it and showed me his post history which was just silly memes. \n\nIf you were in my shoes, would you be as upset or bothered?

Leaving all my friends and a great city job I had going on that payed well and had great benefits. \n\nI lived with her and her parents for about 4 months and couldn\u2019t stand it since her parents fought a lot, her brother causes family problems, they wanted nothing to do with me and I could never find a city job anywhere. The only thing she wanted to ever talk about was how hard online school is, complain about work, complain about her mom and brother. \n\nSo I moved out in a rush and got my own studio but my GF never understood how stressed I was job searching, trying to make friends, and working a lame job at a grocery store while doing it all (not to mention rent prices in Washington, INSANE!!). Before I moved we fought a lot and I felt miserable a lot feeling the regret of moving out here with no real plan and leaving everything behind. I hardly had money to do things we used to do like going out to eat and buying her things. She also keeps talking about a male coworker she likes to talk about and hang with which created problems as well. (I have lame history of girlfriends that cheated, also my dad cheated on my mom which I walked in on so trust is complicated with me)\n\nWe ended up taking a break and I lied about wanting to be with her again because I have no friends and I\u2019m really lonely now.

I feel terrible for wanting to end it because I ruined my career and blame myself for moving to unfamiliar territory. All I feel now is depression and regret.

Communication has been good, there\u2019s been no drama, and I\u2019ve actually gotten more into physical activities and seeing people (while being covid-safe of course). He\u2019s been really good with talking about my anxiety and talking about his own emotions as well. Both of us are out of school and working. He just started working full-time at his job a few weeks ago, which is great because he wasn\u2019t getting a lot of hours before and that was causing him a lot of stress. I\u2019ve had two part time jobs since I met him and I\u2019ve been recently studying for a standardized test for a graduate program I\u2019m applying to.\n\nWhen we first met, I was working a lot, legitimately every single day for two weeks type of a lot, but I always made an effort to talk to him and see him at least twice a week, even for just a sleepover. I\u2019ve reduced my hours at one of my jobs since I started studying for my test so I\u2019m working less but I still am doing a lot of work, if that makes sense. \n\nSince he\u2019s started his job full-time I feel like he\u2019s less interested in hanging out with me. He\u2019s definitely more of an introvert than I am and needs a lot of time alone. I\u2019m also getting a lot of my recharge time when I\u2019m studying and taking breaks, while he\u2019s at an office with people for 40 hours a week. I\u2019ve also felt like he\u2019s pulling away a little in terms of our relationship. I\u2019m not really sure how to describe it other than just a feeling I\u2019m getting. We definitely used to text a lot more, and always made it a priority to text good night and he said he forgot a few days ago and hasn\u2019t texted tonight (which is kind of what made me write this post). \n\nLast week I slept over at his house (which is less stressful for him than staying at my place) and he slept through his alarms after I left (about 15 minutes before his alarm should have gone off). He was really upset and although he didn\u2019t outright blame me, I feel like he felt like I was responsible. I was supposed to stay over at his place again last night, but he texted as I was getting ready that he just needed to be alone. \n\nI understand that people have off days and people are tired sometimes but would it be too much for me to ask to see have a sleepover once a week? We see each other at least twice a week for two hours doing a physical activity but it\u2019s not exactly us-time where we talk and hangout, it\u2019s more focused on the activity. I get that some weeks are busier than others but I just don\u2019t want to fall into a pattern where we don\u2019t get any quality time (by far my top love language) for a whole week.

He insists he does not, but some behaviors have made me worried and my insecurities lead to incessant intrusive thoughts. \n\nHello! I had made and deleted a post on this same topic months ago but I\u2019m revisiting it now because I continue to worry. Basically, my boyfriend had a really close female friend in high school who he had a huge crush on through freshman year of college. He told her how he felt, she rejected him. He tried to move on. Months later he and I met and absolutely hit it off. He says he believes and I believe most of the time that we are soulmates. He treats me so so well and there is so much mutual effort and love in our relationship. We are 19 and 20 but have discussed our future in terms of getting an apartment after college and getting married and having kids. We make each other incredibly happy. \n\nEarly on when we started \u201ctalking\u201d and e discussed our heartbreaks and he told me about this past high school crush. I knew who she was, and that they were still friends. The fact that he was so open about it made me feel good. But at some point, maybe three months into us dating, she followed me on social media and I saw her photos and realized how beautiful she was. I have severe body dysmorphic disorder so my brain immediately began the intrusive thoughts that she is so much more beautiful than I and there\u2019s no way he doesn\u2019t prefer her over me. One time, I was very worried about it and wanted an answer, so I asked my boyfriend if he had any lingering feelings for her and expressed my insecurity. He reassured me in his loving way and I believed him, but it was always at the back of my mind. \n\nI had discussed this with my therapist and she told me this was my body dysmorphia acting up and that I was overworking the situation in my head. I knew my boyfriend and this girl friend were still friends, but not as close as they used to be. However, about a month ago, I woke up in his bed and he went to take a shower and had left his phone open. I didn\u2019t even have to snoop through his phone, but her instagram account was wide open on his phone. Clearly, he was stalking her social media. This made my heart sink. I started crying while he was in the shower and explained once he got back. He began reassuring me again and finally admitted that he cut her off as a friend after she rejected him and he felt guilty about it, so he often does check up on her socials. This made me extremely uncomfortable and I felt like everything I was worried about was true. It turned out also that he had her text conversation on do not disturb, and he told me that because I had expressed insecurity about her before, he didn\u2019t want to worry me, but he realizes it was the wrong thing to do. He offered to let me look through all of their conversations but I declined and said I trust him. (Through what I\u2019m typing this sounds like a cold conversation but he was being extremely loving and kind the whole time.) We ended up talking through the situation for about two weeks and I went back and forth between trusting what he said and doubting whether he still had feelings for her.

The year that followed, she had hundreds of different surgeries and procedures trying to save her heart resulting in infertility, kidney failure, and a bunch of other side effects. This eventually landed her on the heart transplant list.  In March of 2020, she received a heart transplant but had a multitude of other issues with rejection and clotting resulting in even more procedures and surgeries. \n\nSara's family situation was difficult. Her parents had divorced when she was really young and her dad was not a part of her life. She was raised by her mom and they had a relatively good relationship until Sara got sick. Her mom had a mental break and was convinced that there was nothing wrong with Sara and started becoming really abusive physically and emotionally. She would do things like pour her medications down the drain and cut wires to medical devices. Sara's closest family were her aunt and uncle who lived an hour away and came to most of her appointments with her. Her uncle was a doctor and had a lot of connections to get her the care she needed. \n\nBeside her aunt and uncle, Sara had very limited support during this time. Most of our college friends lived in different places and I was really the only one who was physically able to help her during this time. And she was dying so did everything I could. I spent hours going over appointments and lab work. I made dinner for her multiple times a week. I slept on her couch when she felt like she wouldn't make it through the night. I dropped everything to care for her, including often my own friends and family. My 28 year old close friend was dying and had no one to be there for her through it all - I did what anyone would do.\n\nIt is important to mention that I was in medical school during this time, so even though most of my free time was spent with Sara, I hardly had any free time to begin with. From the beginning there was always something weird about Sara's illness. Her doctors would make stupid mistakes that I was always appalled by. This prompted me to become even more entwined with her life as it seemed like there was always a doctor messing up and it was up to me and her uncle to double check everything to prevent her from dying. Obviously, this was very stressful for a medical student as I basically knew nothing and had barely scratched the surface of medicine. But whenever something didn't make sense to me, I would always attribute it to me not knowing a lot about that area of medicine or communication breakdown from her doctor to her then back to me. A lot of things get lost in translation.\n\nAround the time of her heart transplant,  I texted a small group of our close friends who lived in other cities updating them about her status while she was in surgery. Sara had told me she was keeping them all in the loop but they all seemed really surprised when I texted them. After the surgery, Sara had found out I sent the text and was really, really upset with me. She said that I crossed a boundary and I had no right telling other people her health information. I was confused because I was like you told me these people knew what was going on and I thought they might want to know that you survived the surgery. ???\n\nThis sort of thing happened often where she would get extremely angry with me for \"crossing boundaries\" by talking to others about her health. She claimed that she didn't want everyone to know what what going on because didn't want them to treat her differently or pity her because she was dying. She also said that she had a lot of trust issues due her dad leaving her when she was young and now her mom abandoning her when she needed her most and she was afraid that if people knew they would just leave. \n\nTruth is, I just needed to tell people because I needed support. I was trying to be a full time med student and take care of a dying friend (in the middle of a global pandemic) and it started to weigh on me. A lot.  Around July 2020, I had come to the realization that our relationship was extremely toxic. She would constantly claim I was being a bad friend for the littlest things, we would get into an argument, and then she would send a long love-bombing apology text. I knew the friendship was bad but we had been friends for years and she was basically going to die at any moment. I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be a dying 28 year old without any parents so I gave her a lot of slack for how she dealt with it all. I tried to take a step back and force her to include some of our other good friends as support as well because I had been caring for her for over a year and I couldn't do it alone anymore.\n\nAround this same time, I started to noticed that somethings weren't adding up. First of all, I was gaining a little bit more medical knowledge and second of all she had been \"dying\" now for 16 months and did not look near as ill as she should have. She started saying things that just didn't make any sense like the ER not admitting her in times when I know 1,000% they would have. I was suspicious but  if you ask someone \"are you actually dying? I don't believe you.\" and it  turns out they are, you automatically are the biggest asshole ever. \n\nIt eventually got to the point where I brought it up to one of our mutual friends who knew the whole situation and was also in med school but we agreed it was near impossible for her to be lying. She had a scar from where they placed an internal cardiac monitor, there was a basket full of prescription bottles by her bed, all the medications she was taking and doctors she was seeing were real and what you should be doing if you have her condition. She had even shared the letter that her heart donor's wife had sent and shown us pictures of their baby. I'd seen the transplant list paperwork on her counter she was supposed to fill out.\n\nBut I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I had never been to a doctors appointment with her (mix of my busy schedule and her \"trust\" issues), and I had never met her aunt and uncle who were her other primary caregivers. She would frequently ask me to get dinner with them or meet her and her aunt for manicures but I was always out of town (every single time). We both shared our location with each other and I started to check hers when she would say she was going in to the hospital for something. I noticed it would always go to \"location services not available.\" It could be that she was in a part of the hospital that had bad reception or she put her phone on airplane mode. But she also could be lying.\n\nFinally, in October 2020 she told me that she was driving herself to a bigger city a few hours away for an urgent heart procedure. It was scheduled for 3:30pm on a Saturday. At this point in my medical career I knew that there is no procedures being done at 3pm on a Saturday where the patient can drive themselves to the hospital. If something is happening then, its because they are actively dying and came in an ambulance.  I decided to call her sister. Sara had told me that she didn't speak with her sister much anymore because her sister knew about the abuse her mom was inflicting on her and didn't do anything so I was extremely nervous. She picked up and thats when I got confirmation that it was all a lie. \n\nI met up with her mom, sister, and grandmother the next day and we figured out everything she had been telling me and our group of friends had been a lie - her illness, the things about her family, her job, she even had a boyfriend for over a year that none of us had ever heard about. When Sara got home (she had called me the night before sobbing because she was \"in so much pain from the surgery\" She was actually at an engagement party) her mom confronted her. I went over later that night when her mom was still there and tried to get some answers and basically all she said was, \"well you seem to know everything so why don't you figure it out.\" I blocked her number and have had basically no contact with her since then. \n\nI told the rest of our group of close friends and my family but haven't done more than that. I tried to reach out to some of her co-worker friends to see if she had also been lying to them but they all gave weird responses like, \"I don't feel comfortable discussing this\" or \"I haven't heard anything about this but I hope you guys can work it out.\" I am concerned about what lies she could have been telling others about me. Her mom was kind and if she was telling me that she was abusing her then what could she have made up about me?\n\nI overall feel like this person is just dangerous. She works in healthcare (how I think she got a lot of the information) and it honestly frightens me to think what she might be capable of. She has a new boyfriend she is putting all over social media. We have a large group of mutual friends from college who also have no idea. Part of me feels like people should know what she did so they can be aware of what kind of person she is but the other part of me is afraid that I will look like the stupid crazy one if I say anything (I am in med school after all, I should have probably known sooner). \n\nI spoke with Sara's mom once on the phone and she told me she is seeing a counselor once a week but she can't force her to do anything more than she chooses to do. I spoke with Sara briefly on the phone about 3 months after I found out and she apologized and says she is seeing three different mental health providers. I don't know if I believe her. She did lie to me about seeing a therapist in the past.\n\nSara's illness had a profound effect on my life. No one should feel like they are the sole support for someone who is dying and Sara would get angry with me for \"sharing health information\" anytime I vented to friends for support. She emotionally and psychologically abused me for almost two years. It had a huge effect on my studies and grades as most of my study time was dedicated to caring for her. It had an effect on my relationships - she would always have a crisis when I was with my long distance bf or when I had plans with other friends or was with my own family. I don't know if my desire to warn others and tell them what she did to me is just me being revengeful or if its the right thing to do. Or do I just leave this all in the past and try to move on with my life.\n\nTLDR: A close friend faked being terminally ill for almost 2 years and it ruined my life. what do I do now", "title": "I (29F) have been the main caretaker of a friend (28F) for the last 2 years as she went through terminal illness.

I don't want to give up, but did I make the right decision?\n\nHey Reddit,\n\nI usually just lurk in these posts trying to find some advice from people outside of my environment. Here's a little backstory to give everyone an idea on my situation.\n\nA month after breaking up with my first girlfriend ever (yes, it was too soon but we've worked through it), I \\[23/M\\] started talking with this girl \\[20/F\\] in late May of last year. I knew of her but never got to know her personally until now. We talked for a few days and got to know each other and found out we had some similarities such as being born in the same town, love Marvel movies, have similar humor, similar music tastes. No red flags whatsoever. After a few days, we decided to go on a coffee date and it was fun! We're both a little shy/reserved but after breaking the ice, we really enjoyed our time together and even went on a drive afterwards. Everything went great and by the end of June we were officially dating.\n\nThis is where things get crazy. I was already spending basically all my time over at her place when I ended up getting a COVID scare and was forced to miss a week's worth of work while waiting for my test results. Since we had been spending so much time together, we decided it was best to quarantine together at her place. During this time she had mentioned that she felt bad that I was paying for my own apartment, but was constantly staying over at her place. One thing led to another and I ended up moving in with her. I was in a lease until November at my apartment, but everything lined up so perfectly it felt like a movie script. I didn't want to break my lease, but ironically her brother was looking for an apartment so by August, he moved in and basically took over the payments/lease until I was able to be taken off. It all worked out perfectly with no problems whatsoever.\n\nBefore I get into more information, I must stress the fact that my girlfriend does have a rough upbringing. It's not my place to discuss her history, but I will say it was rough and nobody should ever be put through the things she was put through. She has a complicated relationship with her parents due to this and her ex-boyfriend was a legitimate psychopath who used to tell her he'd \"get off\" to the thought of her dying. Really fucked up stuff that will seriously mess up anybody that goes through it. She was going to therapy when I met her after her ex-boyfriend trying to better herself and get healthier and happier.\n\nNow here's some more key information. Where I worked at the time when we met, I was working with my ex girlfriend. We established a \"civil\" agreement at work and kept to ourselves. At first, this wasn't a problem with my new girlfriend until about a month or 2 into living with her. She began getting upset at me thinking that I still had feelings for my ex or that I was doing things with my ex while I was at work. Nothing ever happened, and the reality of it was extreme awkwardness and trying to ignore each other to the best of our abilities while at work. It flared up so bad a couple times that my current girlfriend even told me to pack my things and leave over text one night after I got home from work because she thought that our work nicknames, (that everyone at our work has) was a nickname that I have my ex. I tried to refuse but it got to the point that I had a lot of my stuff by the door before she finally said she didn't want me to leave and let me talk things out with her.\n\nThings took time to recover after that but i'm pretty mentally stable and I always look at things in a realistic way to the best of my abilities. I'm an emotionally strong person who doesn't react from emotion. I react from reality. There were some jealously and insecurity issues on her part throughout the relationship but the majority of them got worked on and she showed signs of improvement and progress. At the end of October, I was able to quit my job and work on my freelance design. I ended up getting a part time job at her Dad's business while I worked on my design every other day. I treated it as a job. There were some issues that arose from this as well, because she was used to me spending all my time with her. I am naturally an introvert and I am someone who needs personal space. So once we established the relationship, I started dedicating time to my work and time to myself whether it's playing games with friends or spending time with friends or family in person by myself. She started getting upset with me that I wasn't spending enough time with her, even though we lived in the same house and we spent the majority of our time together already. As i'm sure the most of you can see where this is going, she had some codependency, clingy and attachment issues.\n\nThis is where things get pretty rough. I had my best friend coming down for 2 days and we had planned it a week in advance. She was more than happy to offer him to stay over at our place and everything seemed good. He lives an hour away, and I don't like being on my phone when i'm spending quality time with someone. My girlfriend is the type to text every minute if i'm responding. At the time, if I went longer than 30 minutes without responding, she'd ask what was taking so long. I got frustrated because she was causing problems the day that my friend was coming over. I told her that when we get home, we are pretending everything is fine because I am not dragging my friend into drama. My friend ended up going to visit another friend for an hour while he was in town. During this hour, my girlfriend and I got into an argument. My friend came back and she left and drove away somewhere. She then began texting me very depressing things saying she didn't want to live anymore and she hates herself and stuff like that. I ended up being on my phone trying to coax her back home and make sure she's safe the entire time that my friend was visiting.\n\nNeedless to say, I was pissed. The next day, I drove my friend home and I was ready to move out when I got home. Things had been building up at that point and that was the last straw. I got home and I let her know exactly how I felt. That was the first time I ever raised my voice at her since we started dating. This all happened I believe around November. She begged me not to leave, she apologized, she admitted she was wrong and I told her that if any of the problems that we've talked about multiple times and have \"resolved\" happen again, it's over. Things were definitely rocky from there but we were trying. Thanksgiving rolls around and we have a good thanksgiving together. We spent time at both of our parents homes and went home happy. Things were looking up!\n\nThen, the VID struck. We only had 5 people total at my parent's house for Thanksgiving, myself and my girlfriend included. We all got COVID and were quarantined for 2 weeks from work. On the 6th day of my COVID experience, I felt like death. I was in bed for almost a whole week straight, and the 6th day was awful. It just so happens that this day, my girlfriend got upset with me over something and we ended up arguing. She ended up texting my Mom telling her to come help me move out because I was sick. That was the final straw. When I finally got up and started packing, she said things like \"So you're actually leaving?\" and I explained that she did it to herself by texting my Mom telling her to help me moveout because she was upset.\n\nI moved out and we broke up. She bombarded me with extremely emotional texts over the next couple weeks. From apology texts to anger texts to I deserve better texts, the whole 9 yards. I finally broke no contact and told her that we need to talk things out and clear the air at least so that things didn't end on a negative note. We talked and decided to give it another try, but starting over as dating to rebuild our connection but work on ourselves individually.\n\nThings went decent for a couple weeks, then we got in an argument over the same problems again and we \"broke up\" again. I know, it's sounding bad but here's where my dilemma comes in.\n\nShe asks me to talk one more time. We agree and we meetup and have a good conversation where she legitimately gave off a different energy. She pulled her head out of her ass and really started to work on improving herself. Eating better, being more social, finding hobbies, going to the gym, working harder, everything that you could do to be better, she was doing. She bought self-help books, made goal-lists, everything. It proved to me that she was trying to be better for herself and she said she still wants to work things out while we're working on ourselves.\n\nThat happened in December. Ever since then we've been together and things have progressively gotten better and are improving. Any problems we have, we ended up talking out and working out... except for 2 major ones.\n\nShe's had a lot of things happen since December in her personal life. She recently felt very suicidal after a lot of stuff happened and we ended up getting into an argument. I managed to coax her and talk to her and keep her from doing anything stupid. She recovered and was doing great for awhile. Improving on herself, us, she has a weekly painting group now, she's working harder, things are legit showing progress.\n\nThen, last night happened. She apparently had a pretty rough day and we ended up getting into another argument. This time though, it got to the point where she said she was done living, done with herself and she was going to kill herself and hung up the phone. I called her 20+ times and she didn't answer, so I did the only thing that I could think of and called the police. She was driving home from a grocery run in a different town when she hung up, so I asked them to keep an eye out for her car to make sure she was okay. She ended up responding to me after I called them but she was still acting to the point I was worried something would actually happening. I managed to talk to her over the phone, made sure she got home safe and was safe in general. Not only was I worried that she was legit going to take her own life, but she after that, she said she was going to kill herself if she lost me.\n\nI continued to talk to her and be as emotionally stable and strong as I could. Deep down I know she wasn't intentionally doing it to threaten me. She was nowhere near a stable mindset to know what she was really saying. We talked, we got her calmed down and I told her I wasn't going anywhere but I did explain to her that what she did was extremely wrong. Threatening to kill yourself over losing somebody is un-excusable. She realized that, apologized and stressed that she never meant to let what happened, happened. I told her I wouldn't go anywhere but I recommended she needs to find help. I also told her that I can't go through that again, and i'm gone if it happens again.\n\nToday, she told me she got her therapy re-booked and her first session is next week.\n\nI love this girl, and I know that she is trying really hard to be better for herself, which in-turn will be better for us and every other aspect of her life. She has shown actual progress and improvement. She's legitimately trying. I care a lot about her, but after what happened i'm very shook up and stressed out.\n\nI want this to work and I want to see her overcome this. I know she can and I know she will, but I can't shake this feeling of knowing whether I made the right decision of staying or not. I don't want to give up, but i'd be lying if I said that i'm not mentally and emotionally exhausted from the arguments, with last night being the cherry on top.\n\nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated. I need advice.

I\u2019m a 26 year old woman and I\u2019m in my first long term relationship, with a 24 year old man. We have been together for almost a year and a half, and he really wants to marry me. He\u2019s a Christian and I\u2019m his first relationship and I\u2019m the only person he has ever been with intimately. He\u2019s an amazing person, who loves animals (huge bonus for me because animals are my world) and he has really good morals. Our goals for the future line up really well, and we are starting to save up for a mortgage for in a few years. Currently we are living with my dad in order to be able to save as much as possible. We have actually been living together in my dads home since about 3 months into our relationship. My dad really likes him, and so does my whole family. His family really likes me, and his parents already feel like family to me- I love them, they\u2019re such good people. My boyfriend and I completely trust each other, which is also huge for me because I\u2019ve had a lot of trauma in my past and I\u2019ve never been able to trust a man before. I know he\u2019s in love with me, and he has his ways of showing it- like cooking for me, cleaning, helping me with stuff. He treats me well and he\u2019s had insane amounts of patience with me throughout the first 6 months or so of our relationship when my trust issues were still a problem. He has shown his commitment and I value his friendship and who he is as a person. \n\nSounds great, right? But there are problems. Mainly, I\u2019m worried about my feelings for him. I\u2019m not sure if the problem is just that I\u2019ve never been with someone for this long, but I am missing that feeling of desire and emotional connection. I am living every day with intense guilt because I can\u2019t stop thinking that I\u2019m supposed to feel more strongly than I do about him, that something is missing. \n\nIn fact, right from the beginning, I didn\u2019t feel as strongly as I probably should have felt. But after all I have been through, the safety of his good morals and clean past made me drawn to him. Safety is huge for me. It has become the most important thing, and since I had a crush on him and did feel some attraction, I decided it would be a good idea to pursue a relationship with him. Knowing what I know about most men, it would be rare to find someone like him, who had morals that align with my own. Even monogamous men have leniency that would make me feel emotionally unsafe. I\u2019ve waited for someone like him since I was a young teen, and I never thought someone like him would actually show up in my life, and he did. The safety is incredibly healing. But at the same time, it isn\u2019t. \n\nI noticed many months ago that my bf shows a lot of signs of having aspergers. I talked to him about it, and he feels like it would explain a lot for him. He spoke with his doctor and took a questionnaire, and the results showed he is highly likely to have it. There\u2019s a 2 year wait to see a specialist for a formal diagnosis, so in the meantime we don\u2019t know for sure, but we can assume. Him having aspergers does not bother me, but some of the symptoms do. He is emotionally immature and this results in my feelings being constantly invalidated. We lack a deep emotional connection and it has left me feeling lonely. He is also shy on levels that are similar to small children\u2019s shyness. Luckily he is not this way with me, he\u2019s completely himself with me. But it makes me really uncomfortable when we\u2019re in public together and I have avoided introducing him to my friends because of this. He doesn\u2019t look at people even when they\u2019re speaking to him. He mumbles so it is nearly impossible to hear him. He doesn\u2019t easily pick up on jokes when his social anxiety is heightened. He is emotionally flat in his interactions even when it is not appropriate to be. I end up feeling like the mom, because I try to ease the awkwardness by helping him communicate in small ways. This is extremely stressful for me, also because I have social anxiety myself. However, mine is what you\u2019d expect from a shy adult. His social anxiety is expressed in ways that seem very strange to people. Even my dad, after living with him for over a year, has commented to me in private that my bf \u201cis very odd. A nice guy, but very strange\u201d. His interactions with my dad make me cringe too, even though he is a bit more comfortable with my dad than he is with anyone else outside of his own family besides me. \n\nIt makes me feel guilty to be embarrassed of him. And the truth is, as a shy woman, I have always liked to be with a man who led the way. My social anxiety has gotten worse while being with my bf. With past boyfriends my social confidence actually improved. It also negative affects my attraction to him. He is not just childlike in his social interactions, but he is childlike in other ways (such as collecting hot wheels cars) and that\u2019s fine, but the thing is that when you put it together with his emotional immaturity, it really does impact my feelings of attraction to him...\n\nHis hygiene is also a huge problem in our relationship, and no matter how many times I try to talk to him about it, he doesn\u2019t seem to care. He doesn\u2019t wash his face twice a day, and he has really oily skin. The main problem is he doesn\u2019t have very good oral hygiene. And his breath smells bad all the time, even after he brushes his teeth. I can\u2019t stand being close to him because of this. He will hopefully soon be going to get a dental cleaning and get his cavities filled, and his doctor put him on medication for GERD, so hopefully this will help too. But as long as he doesn\u2019t properly brush, floss, brush his tongue, we\u2019re still going to have a problem. I can\u2019t remember the last time I wanted to make out with someone, and I\u2019ve never wanted to make out with my bf. Even in the beginning. I miss that part of intimacy with someone. \nHe has a lot of attractive qualities both emotionally and physically, don\u2019t get me wrong. But the breath and the social behaviour really make things hard for me. \n\nThe lack of emotional connection really affects me. I don\u2019t feel understood by him in many ways. He also likes to argue and disagree with things on a regular basis. My feelings are only validated if he judges them as justified. And yes, he judges my feelings all the time. When we talk it is mostly just him going on and on about cars (which are his passion and hobby) and he knows I really don\u2019t care about cars at all. I have no interest in them whatsoever. A lot of the time when he\u2019s talking on and on about it, I end up pretending to listen. It frustrates me because he doesn\u2019t seem to care that I\u2019m not interested in it, but he forces the one sided conversation on me anyways. He will talk about cars for an hour straight if I let him, without even getting more than a \u201cyea\u201d \u201cI see\u201d type of responses from me. I  don\u2019t like hearing about cars on long tangents every single day. To me it\u2019s like someone talking your ear off about paint drying. I need advice about this- am I wrong for not wanting to listen? I have no problem with him pursing his hobby and going to do car related stuff, but as far as hearing about it all the time- I want to tear my hair out. \n\nHe wants to marry me ASAP, but I\u2019m not feeling sure because of my lack of intimate desire for him, and because of my lack of feeling smitten/giddy/emotional connection. Are my feelings normal at this point in a relationship? \n\nAlso something to note is that we have spent pretty much 24/7 with each other for our whole relationship. We were in college together and then we both haven\u2019t found employment because of covid. We both want some personal space but there isn\u2019t many options to get any space at the moment. And there is nothing to go do together, because of all the closures. We are cooped up together and never experiencing anything fun as a couple. I know this is contributing to the problem. But I also know that I didn\u2019t start out the relationship feeling as giddy and head over heels as I have in my past relationships. So I\u2019m really concerned. \n\nI have had many episodes of crying when I\u2019m alone, when he goes to bed before me.

I don't want to give up, but did I make the right decision?  \n\n\nHey Reddit,  \n\n\nI usually just lurk in these posts trying to find some advice from people outside of my environment. Here's a little backstory to give everyone an idea on my situation.  \n\n\nA month after breaking up with my first girlfriend ever (yes, it was too soon but we've worked through it), I started talking with this girl in late May of last year. I knew of her but never got to know her personally until now. We talked for a few days and got to know each other and found out we had some similarities such as being born in the same town, love Marvel movies, have similar humor, similar music tastes. No red flags whatsoever. After a few days, we decided to go on a coffee date and it was fun! We're both a little shy/reserved but after breaking the ice, we really enjoyed our time together and even went on a drive afterwards. Everything went great and by the end of June we were officially dating.  \n\n\nThis is where things get crazy. I was already spending basically all my time over at her place when I ended up getting a COVID scare and was forced to miss a week's worth of work while waiting for my test results. Since we had been spending so much time together, we decided it was best to quarantine together at her place. During this time she had mentioned that she felt bad that I was paying for my own apartment, but was constantly staying over at her place. One thing led to another and I ended up moving in with her. I was in a lease until November at my apartment, but everything lined up so perfectly it felt like a movie script. I didn't want to break my lease, but ironically her brother was looking for an apartment so by August, he moved in and basically took over the payments/lease until I was able to be taken off. It all worked out perfectly with no problems whatsoever.  \n\n\nBefore I get into more information, I must stress the fact that my girlfriend does have a rough upbringing. It's not my place to discuss her history, but I will say it was rough and nobody should ever be put through the things she was put through. She has a complicated relationship with her parents due to this and her ex-boyfriend was a legitimate psychopath who used to tell her he'd \"get off\" to the thought of her dying. Really fucked up stuff that will seriously mess up anybody that goes through it. She was going to therapy when I met her after her ex-boyfriend trying to better herself and get healthier and happier.  \n\n\nNow here's some more key information. Where I worked at the time when we met, I was working with my ex girlfriend. We established a \"civil\" agreement at work and kept to ourselves. At first, this wasn't a problem with my new girlfriend until about a month or 2 into living with her. She began getting upset at me thinking that I still had feelings for my ex or that I was doing things with my ex while I was at work. Nothing ever happened, and the reality of it was extreme awkwardness and trying to ignore each other to the best of our abilities while at work. It flared up so bad a couple times that my current girlfriend even told me to pack my things and leave over text one night after I got home from work because she thought that our work nicknames, (that everyone at our work has) was a nickname that I have my ex. I tried to refuse but it got to the point that I had a lot of my stuff by the door before she finally said she didn't want me to leave and let me talk things out with her.  \n\n\nThings took time to recover after that but i'm pretty mentally stable and I always look at things in a realistic way to the best of my abilities. I'm an emotionally strong person who doesn't react from emotion. I react from reality. There were some jealously and insecurity issues on her part throughout the relationship but the majority of them got worked on and she showed signs of improvement and progress. At the end of October, I was able to quit my job and work on my freelance design. I ended up getting a part time job at her Dad's business while I worked on my design every other day. I treated it as a job. There were some issues that arose from this as well, because she was used to me spending all my time with her. I am naturally an introvert and I am someone who needs personal space. So once we established the relationship, I started dedicating time to my work and time to myself whether it's playing games with friends or spending time with friends or family in person by myself. She started getting upset with me that I wasn't spending enough time with her, even though we lived in the same house and we spent the majority of our time together already. As i'm sure the most of you can see where this is going, she had some codependency, clingy and attachment issues.  \n\n\nThis is where things get pretty rough. I had my best friend coming down for 2 days and we had planned it a week in advance. She was more than happy to offer him to stay over at our place and everything seemed good. He lives an hour away, and I don't like being on my phone when i'm spending quality time with someone. My girlfriend is the type to text every minute if i'm responding. At the time, if I went longer than 30 minutes without responding, she'd ask what was taking so long. I got frustrated because she was causing problems the day that my friend was coming over. I told her that when we get home, we are pretending everything is fine because I am not dragging my friend into drama. My friend ended up going to visit another friend for an hour while he was in town. During this hour, my girlfriend and I got into an argument. My friend came back and she left and drove away somewhere. She then began texting me very depressing things saying she didn't want to live anymore and she hates herself and stuff like that. I ended up being on my phone trying to coax her back home and make sure she's safe the entire time that my friend was visiting.  \n\n\nNeedless to say, I was pissed. The next day, I drove my friend home and I was ready to move out when I got home. Things had been building up at that point and that was the last straw. I got home and I let her know exactly how I felt. That was the first time I ever raised my voice at her since we started dating. This all happened I believe around November. She begged me not to leave, she apologized, she admitted she was wrong and I told her that if any of the problems that we've talked about multiple times and have \"resolved\" happen again, it's over. Things were definitely rocky from there but we were trying. Thanksgiving rolls around and we have a good thanksgiving together. We spent time at both of our parents homes and went home happy. Things were looking up!  \n\n\nThen, the VID struck. We only had 5 people total at my parent's house for Thanksgiving, myself and my girlfriend included. We all got COVID and were quarantined for 2 weeks from work. On the 6th day of my COVID experience, I felt like death. I was in bed for almost a whole week straight, and the 6th day was awful. It just so happens that this day, my girlfriend got upset with me over something and we ended up arguing. She ended up texting my Mom telling her to come help me move out because I was sick. That was the final straw. When I finally got up and started packing, she said things like \"So you're actually leaving?\" and I explained that she did it to herself by texting my Mom telling her to help me moveout because she was upset.  \n\n\nI moved out and we broke up. She bombarded me with extremely emotional texts over the next couple weeks. From apology texts to anger texts to I deserve better texts, the whole 9 yards. I finally broke no contact and told her that we need to talk things out and clear the air at least so that things didn't end on a negative note. We talked and decided to give it another try, but starting over as dating to rebuild our connection but work on ourselves individually.  \n\n\nThings went decent for a couple weeks, then we got in an argument over the same problems again and we \"broke up\" again. I know, it's sounding bad but here's where my dilemma comes in.  \n\n\nShe asks me to talk one more time. We agree and we meetup and have a good conversation where she legitimately gave off a different energy. She pulled her head out of her ass and really started to work on improving herself. Eating better, being more social, finding hobbies, going to the gym, working harder, everything that you could do to be better, she was doing. She bought self-help books, made goal-lists, everything. It proved to me that she was trying to be better for herself and she said she still wants to work things out while we're working on ourselves.  \n\n\nThat happened in December. Ever since then we've been together and things have progressively gotten better and are improving. Any problems we have, we ended up talking out and working out... except for 2 major ones.  \n\n\nShe's had a lot of things happen since December in her personal life. She recently felt very suicidal after a lot of stuff happened and we ended up getting into an argument. I managed to coax her and talk to her and keep her from doing anything stupid. She recovered and was doing great for awhile. Improving on herself, us, she has a weekly painting group now, she's working harder, things are legit showing progress.  \n\n\nThen, last night happened. She apparently had a pretty rough day and we ended up getting into another argument. This time though, it got to the point where she said she was done living, done with herself and she was going to kill herself and hung up the phone. I called her 20+ times and she didn't answer, so I did the only thing that I could think of and called the police. She was driving home from a grocery run in a different town when she hung up, so I asked them to keep an eye out for her car to make sure she was okay. She ended up responding to me after I called them but she was still acting to the point I was worried something would actually happening. I managed to talk to her over the phone, made sure she got home safe and was safe in general. Not only was I worried that she was legit going to take her own life, but she after that, she said she was going to kill herself if she lost me.  \n\n\nI continued to talk to her and be as emotionally stable and strong as I could. Deep down I know she wasn't intentionally doing it to threaten me. She was nowhere near a stable mindset to know what she was really saying. We talked, we got her calmed down and I told her I wasn't going anywhere but I did explain to her that what she did was extremely wrong. Threatening to kill yourself over losing somebody is un-excusable. She realized that, apologized and stressed that she never meant to let what happened, happened. I told her I wouldn't go anywhere but I recommended she needs to find help. I also told her that I can't go through that again, and i'm gone if it happens again.  \n\n\nToday, she told me she got her therapy re-booked and her first session is next week.  \n\n\nI love this girl, and I know that she is trying really hard to be better for herself, which in-turn will be better for us and every other aspect of her life. She has shown actual progress and improvement. She's legitimately trying. I care a lot about her, but after what happened i'm very shook up and stressed out.  \n\n\nI want this to work and I want to see her overcome this. I know she can and I know she will, but I can't shake this feeling of knowing whether I made the right decision of staying or not. I don't want to give up, but i'd be lying if I said that i'm not mentally and emotionally exhausted from the arguments, with last night being the cherry on top.   \n\n\nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated. I need advice.

Before I start, I know I am insecure, and I know I have a lot of self love to work on so please save the super harsh comments. Moving forward, long story short, I don\u2019t believe in my head I am my boyfriends \u201ctype\u201d. I am very skinny, 97 lbs to be exact, I\u2019m asian and 5\u20191 with zero boobs and no butt (F, 20 yrs). \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s(M, 21yrs) type before me was girls who have big boobs and big ass (His instagram likes, past flings, etc) and I can\u2019t help but think he just settled for me, but is secretly wishing I had those traits. And I really wish I did, cause maybe he would be more attracted to me, but it\u2019s super hard for me to gain weight and I have to save up for a boob job. \n\nBut regardless, the main reason why I bring this up is because we broke up for about 3 days, having to do with my insecurity issues, but while we were broken up, he followed a girl who looks nothing like me. And we have made boundaries in our relationship to not follow random people we don\u2019t know (instagram models, random girls etc) so it kind of stung when I saw him actually follow someone new, and she followed him back, and she is like PERFECT. She is blonde, curvy, big boobs and ass. The whole package. And it really hurt me cause it makes me believe that the minute we broke up, he tried looking for someone who has everything that I lack with my body. \n\nHe keeps telling me that\u2019s not the case, and that he was just angry etc and he unfollowed her, but I can\u2019t get it off my mind, especially since this was already an issue in our relationship. We have been dating for a year and a half and for some reason I just feel so worthless when it comes to my body. We have no issues in bed, but sometimes when we are doing the deed I can tell he wants to grab my ass but I have none (LOL!). \n\nAt the end of the day, I just can\u2019t shake this horrible feeling. With my boyfriend, he is my exact type. He is everything I have wanted in a person, looks wise, body, etc., so I don\u2019t really find anyone else attractive, only him. It just hurts to think I am not what he really wants. He says if he wanted those girls he would leave me and go for them, but I feel like if those girls were me in every way (personality) he would instantly leave me for them. \n\nI know that\u2019s a silly way to think, I just struggle so badly with my own body image and things like this doesn\u2019t help. I hate social media and I wish my partner didn\u2019t even have it but I can\u2019t be that controlling. I just wish I had some other perspective, maybe from the guys point of view if you have ever been in this situation? He tells me he loves me and that he\u2019s attracted to me, I just can\u2019t help but think he finds other people way more attractive, and he\u2019s just settling for me. \n\nI know I sound super insecure, but this has been straining our relationship for a while and I\u2019m desperate for advice. Should I leave, and try to work on myself and learn to love me for who I am? Or should I stay, and have it constantly sit in my head that I\u2019m not enough or what my partner wants? Thanks for reading this if you\u2019ve gotten this far. I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Any advice is welcomed and appreciated.

We are planning to move in together some time this year after he gets his driver's license. He has scheduled the lessons today and they start in March. We have had hiccups in our relationship but I've only seriously thought of leaving once. We had been planning to move to one particular city for about six months and he suddenly told me in December that he didn't want to move there. I had sunk my heart into this place looking at apartments, restaurants, jobs, etc. And it was absolutely devastating for me.\n\n His reason was that he wants to move somewhere less expensive because he worries we'll run into financial issues if we move where I wanted to. I thought long and hard about it and told him I understand. We still want to move in together but we aren't sure where now. Both of us still live with our moms for the moment. He financially supports her and I help my mom around the house and help her keep track of things since she's older. He wants to move into my current town or his current town the most. That is the opposite of what I want. If it were up to me we'd move cross-country but he already wanted to stay in the state so I compromised there. Then, I picked the city he doesn't want to move to now. I feel like I am stuck. \n\nI don't want to live in my current town because I have a lot of relationship issues with my mother. He has the same thing with his mother in his town. I feel like he is being too worried about being \"safe\" and doesn't want to take any risks. I want to do this 100% and it's hard to tell if he's actually ready. He says we will split chores and responsibilities evenly but he doesn't clean in his apartment with her and his brother. His mom raised them to be co-dependent with her. She does their laundry, all the cleaning and most of the cooking. Every time she leaves the house she makes one of them come and she is bad at respecting physical boundaries (barging in his room etc).She also homeschooled him and he says she did a very bad job of it. Covid has roadblocked his driving lessons this whole year. I lost my job during the pandemic. Everything has been difficult and stressful and planning a move while dealing with my mother hasn't been easy. \n\nWhen he told me he didn't want to move to the city we had been planning I accepted it but I asked him to prove some things to me because he hasn't been good at follow through. For example, do his laundry, clean something once a week, plan a date night once a month. None of this happened. I brought it up last night and asked if he could maybe sweep the kitchen once a week. He was clearly annoyed and exasperatedly said \"ugh, fine.\" And it ticked me off. Their kitchen is incredibly tiny. That was the easiest task in the whole apartment I could think of and he still complained. When I asked why he was acting this way about it he said \"you don't live here so why do you care?\" I told him it's about proving it to me that he can do it, it might help his relationship with his mom if he started to show independence, and it'll help him get used to doing it for the future. I've said this countless times. \n\nWe both got mad after I complained some more about what a manchild he was being and went to bed. Today he still hasn't talked to me. Do you think he can grow? Am I being too controlling? I don't want to break up with him. He understands me and loves me better than I've ever been loved. He treats me so well in every other aspect of this relationship. I'm trying to figure out how I can open his eyes to independence being a good thing and being worth it. He also never stands up to his mother about anything because he hates conflict. I just want to help but I feel exhausted. \n\nTLDR: boyfriend is bad at following through. He will not clean at all in his own apartment or do his own laundry despite the fact that he keeps saying he will when we move in together. I just want him to show some independence and initiative. He also does not plan dates and always says \"I don't know\". He doesn't want to move out of his current city despite issues with his controlling mother. He is also the sweetest, most generous, loving and understanding person I've ever met.

At the same time of which we have been exclusive (6+ months).\n\nBeing totally honest I have had issues with her and guy friends before. One literally being in love with her and when I raised my concerns at the fact this guy was kept on all of her private stories and involved in her personal life she simply said, \"I know my friends better\". 3 months later he admitted all her feelings for her and I appreciate I do not know her friends as well but they previously had gone out and it was obvious he was never over her to all of her friends and myself! She even went to a party where that guy and all his friends tried to get her and the guy to get together too and honestly, it was painfully obvious to everyone. It took her around 6 months to acknowledge my discomfort with this situation and she only acknowledged it through one of her friends explaining it to her - not me.\n\nI want to have a conversation about this with her and I am not really sure how to address this issue. I don't want to come off as controlling. She has said this guy doesn't want a girlfriend until university and I simply don't buy it. My girlfriend has even said to me how she seems to always be her guy friend's dream girl. I know that sounds bad on my behalf. \n\nAll I want is some reassurance but I don't want to be wrong. I have spoken to my friends about it and they say that it's a complex situation but at the end of the day, I am right to getting bad vibes from the situation. I trust she isn't cheating on me. I just don't trust the guy and I know that is bad for me to say but the circumstances around the situation make me really uncomfortable.\n\nShe also doesn't have many friends at all and I am not sure what to do generally about this.\n\nAll I am asking is if I am justified for feeling this way and how can I approach this situation the right way.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nTL;DR: Am I right to feel uncomfortable with a guy best friend that has been brought in with strange circumstances?", "title": "Am I Right To Be Uncomfortable With A Guy Bestfriend?"}, {"created_utc": 1613687673, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lmzc4b/i_am_afraid_of_my_older_sister/", "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "selftext": "My sister (21F) has never hit me but I am terrified of her.

A year ago, I ended up needing brain surgery (full craniotomy). It was supposed to be a one time thing, but it went very wrong and there were complications that led to a second emergency craniotomy, and 2 more brain surgeries afterwards to repair. I was in a coma and almost died from this, it was a big deal. There is a vague threat I will need more in the future but it's not something my surgeon is concerned about right now.\n\nThe surgical site was behind my left ear. Basically, after all this, my skull healed back weird. (my surgeon did not insert a titanium plate). Basically, I have what is kinda like a valley in my skull. From the top of my head to right above my hairline, there is a long straight indent that is incredibly deep (if I stick my finger in it it goes up to my first knuckle), and a soft spot that is terrifying to touch because it feels like my brain is not protected by my skull. The areas around the \"valley\" have formed a somewhat protruded rounding shape.\n\nThis deformity is 100% hidden by my hair (since it has grown back from the parts that were shaved). You cannot at all tell it exists by looking, no matter how I wear my hair. But, the second you touch my head on that side, it is incredibly obvious and IMO disturbing to feel.\n\nI am considered an attractive person by most. But it's gotten to the point where I feel like crying when I wash my hair because I'm so upset over my skull. I feel like I shouldn't because nobody can see it.

Chris walked into the room as Kelly was saying her in-laws are \u201cidiots\u201d, and Chris, not knowing the situation, started essentially scolding Kelly for talking crap about Jake\u2019s family, saying she had no right, she\u2019s being disrespectful towards Jake, he feels bad for him, and if I were to ever speak that way about his family, I\u2019d be out of his life forever. I tried to tell Chris he didn\u2019t have the whole picture, and Jake also tried saying that Kelly was right and there was a lot to the story, not just petty hatred towards his family. Chris wasn\u2019t hearing it, and by this point Kelly was really embarrassed and looked like she was going to cry. We ended the call and Kelly texted me to say \u201csorry I upset Chris. I do like him, but honestly did not appreciate being spoken to that way. I hope he doesn\u2019t speak that way to you.\u201d I told Chris I needed him to apologize to Kelly or things were going to be awkward from now on between all of us. He says absolutely not, he feels bad that they\u2019re in that situation with Jake\u2019s parents, but he stands by his opinion that it\u2019s never acceptable to badmouth your s/o\u2019s family, especially publicly. I\u2019m worried we won\u2019t all be able to get past this if he doesn\u2019t apologize to her and say he overreacted. I\u2019m also concerned that Chris\u2019 behavior could be a red flag, but at the same time, he\u2019s an adult, so I certainly can\u2019t make him apologize. I don\u2019t know if his behavior and choice to not apologize should be a dealbreaker in our relationship, or if I\u2019m completely overreacting. \n\nTl;dr: My bf scolded/lectured my sister for calling her in-laws idiots (they are) while she and I were on FaceTime.

Instead of messaging her, I would just follow the smell of decay to each room until I located her. An acquaintance that had a son in medical school mentioned I should put Vicks Vaporub under my nose to blunt the smell whenever she spoke to me-it really didn't help and people asked why I had it there.

I have never been with another woman romantically or sexually and that's never bothered me much because we are compatible as friends, we care for each other deeply and we both please each other sexually so we never put much thought into the idea of not being together. My issue stems from the fact that going into this relationship in highschool never intended for it to last long and figured it would be over by college, though after all the time together we ended up growing and sharing a strong connection. Despite this connection, the times where I saw her as my ideal partner are few. There were some core differences between us I never saw getting past and while they are still issues today find they get suppressed in my attempts to justify everything relationship-related due to our history. I also don't know if these issues are even that big in the grand scheme but she's my first and I don't have anything to compare it too\n\nI recently saw a quote that has really got me thinking about my situation. \"The right person can make you feel more in 5 months than the wrong person can in 5 years.\"\n\n Is it possible to love and care for someone deeply but still not have them be the fully right person for you? Is it possible to be with an amazing partner but still desire something you feel is more ideal? This question haunts me every day because our relationship has always felt just off from perfect but it was never enough to justify any rash action. Sometimes I willcontinually wish that she would cheat on me or dosomething unjustifiable just to make a breakup justifiable rationally, but she never has and she has been extremely loyal, the sex is great and we communicate relatively well. This is what usually backs me down from being tempted to break up, the fact that rationally can't justify it even though my heart has never felt fuly satisfied. In an ideal world, my current girlfriend would have been my second or third romantic partner so that I would be able to accurately gauge if it is as good as it gets or if it is truly off, but have nothing else to compare it to. We have grown a lot in 6 years and we have both put considerable effort into communication and making each other happy but even still feel something is missing on my end that don't know if ill ever fully know because don't know anything else.\n\nIt all seems very black and white to me and I'm left with two options that could both potentially haunt me in the future. If I break up with her I know I may very well not be able to ever find a relationship as easy and natural with the backstory that this one would have, but I also know I wouldn't be able to live with myself if we ended up growing old together and I find myself unhappy and wondering what if we just broke up. I'm still young now and I know I would kick myself for not figuring out my true feelings for 6 years but I also am face to face with the fact that while it would be tough right now it would be even tougher and with more regrets in 2 or 6 more years.\n\ntl;dr: Rationally I have zero reasons to end this relationship, it doesn't make me unhappy but it isn't all Ive wanted from a relationship and I worry that if I stay together even longer it'll be the biggest regret of my life. I worry that if I do break up with her that my throwing away something that isn't broken and does work (with the addition of having a backstory that goes back to highschool)will end up being something I also regret for not seeing my full potential which is something I can't really go back on.

We started dating 2 years ago and have known each other for 9. I have always been fixated on him since I was 13 and always wanted to be with him. It is also important to mention, my prior relationship to this one was extremely physically and emotionally abusive. I also grew up in an abusive household. I am diagnosed with several mental health issues including bipolar disorder type 2, depression, anxiety, and a few other things. I have also been a self harmer since I was 11. I have very very low self esteem.\n\nWhen we started dating, I didn't know anything about his ex and didn't care, I was smitten and just blinded by my love for him and the fact he gave me a chance. His ex is the only other girlfriend he's ever had, lost his virginity to her, etc. They dated for two years, he said they weren't compatible and tried to cheat on her before finally breaking it off because he was unhappy.\n\nFast forward to a month into our relationship and I started looking at her page. She is completely opposite to what I am. She's in college, has a large amount of friends, is extremely beautiful, has no scars on her body, super kind and charismatic, and overall just everything I wished I could be. Style wise we are also completely different looking, she is more on the trendy and \"basic\" side of things while I am more alternative, with dyed hair, tattoos, and piercings.\n\nQuickly this got toxic for me. I would flip back and forth between our pages and compare everything about us. Her facial features, her body, her hair, her style, the amount of likes she gets on pictures, if it could be compared it's fair game. It has gotten to a point where I stalk her social medias MULTIPLE times daily, even down to her pinterest to see if she posted anything new. She even has a youtube channel, so I ended up making one trying to do similar videos. Mine didn't get as much attention as hers and I felt stupid so I stopped posting on there about two months ago.\n\nThe toxic behavior has gotten to a point where I want her to feel how she makes me feel. I want her to also feel shitty and inadequate so I looked up her information on google and started texting her really mean and awful things through text now numbers, and she has addressed the harassment in a livestream and even threatened legal action.\n\nThe worst part is he has compared me to her on multiple occasions, most recently the other night where he was saying he missed her and really fucked their relationship up and wished he could get her back, (she has a new boyfriend and has completely moved on from him.) These comparisons and comments only fuel the impulsive stalking more.\n\nI don't know what to do or how to get myself under control. I'm going to face legal action soon if I don't stop being fucking stupid and learn to stop obsessing and let go. It's not even like I hate her, I don't at all, I wish I was her. I wish I could be as beautiful, smart, and kind as her. I have self harmed and even thought of suicide multiple times over the situation, (I have a history of suicide attempts as well).\n\nI disabled all of my social media on Monday and haven't looked at a single profile of hers since, which is the longest I have since we started dating and I'm honestly proud of myself for doing so. I also deleted my text now account and the app from my phone. I just don't know how to mentally get over it. I just need some genuine advice. Don't be rude or tell me I'm psychotic, I KNOW this is a HUGE problem and not okay, since why I've already taken steps to end the behavior myself.\n\nI posted this on a throwaway account as I'm extremely embarrassed and honest to god disgusted with myself and behavior.

Like, the weird pictures alone make me hesitant. But then it also feels like he's making no effort to actually see me (granted I'm not really making effort to see him either). But he could have been like \"hey we'll be in town from Friday until Sunday morning. When are you free?\" but he didn't. Instead I just get a random \"hi\" on friday night followed by a joke on Saturday about being able to see my house. \n\nSo... I don't know how to handle this. I feel kind of awkward/guilty if I blow them off. Should I just go grab a coffee with them and get it over with in order to preserve an old friendship? Or should I just pull the plug on a friendship that I'm not getting much out of? \n\nAm I looking for excuses by being like \"well he's not trying very hard anyway\" and feeling offended that he's said nothing other than \"hi\" at 5pm on friday? Or is that actually pretty rude?\n\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: old friend is in town but isn't really making an effort to see me.

So after a few months, me and my ex slowly built some kind of friendship with benefits (but a bit more) and after I told her I liked him, she told me about their affairs. I think I felt jealous more about him and betrayed that he didn\u2019t tell me that first, since we were talking daily.\nAnyways, the three of us are a close group and we can tell each other anything but I\u2019m starting to feel left out. They are creating a stronger bond (she had a crush on him for 3 years before high school), probably also because I don\u2019t wanna be more involved with her than we are now.\nStill, what annoys me the most is that my friendship with him feels like a backup plan for him for when he\u2019s alone, because I\u2019ve been there for him the whole time and even during the pandemic, we two were inseparable.\nThe question is: \nShould I try to fade away?\n\nTL;DR: my best friend hooked up with my ex and kept this secret until I got closer to her again, as friends with benefits.

I genuinely believe I'm in love with her - there's nobody else's quirks, habits, and qualities I want to get used to. I like every part of her, the good and the bad. We know each other inside and out.\n\nFor some reason, though, throughout this whole relationship, I've had this nagging feeling that it's not right for me (I'm not into astrology, but for those who are, I'm a Sagittarius and this is apparently a big thing with us). There's always something I look for to convince me of this. It's always just been this nebulous, surface level feeling, but lately it's been more clear.\n\n* I'm an active, outdoors-y person who loves learning. I like hobbies where I can create something instead of consuming something. I'm whatever the opposite of a homebody is. I'm social and extroverted and love doing things with friends. I crave adventure and get anxious at the thought of chaining myself to a desk for my whole life.\n* She is not active and is resistant to learning new things. She likes consumption hobbies like Netflix and watching Youtube vloggers (and will do a lot of this). She is a homebody. She's somewhere between an extrovert and an introvert and will have 1-2 good friends at a time, but will cycle through them (it's not her - people just come and go in big cities).\n\nShe's been unemployed during the pandemic and will be starting to work again soon, so I'm hoping that once she's stuck in front of a computer all day at home that she'll get the itch to leave and will want to do stuff. I've tried roping her in to the stuff I do. Before the pandemic I could sometimes get her to the gym if I trained her, but then there would be no time left for my own workouts (so this isn't really sustainable).\n\nThere are things I'd love to do before I get into my 30s and have to settle down, but they're things that I'd love to do with her instead of alone. Stuff like backpacking across the country, living in a van for a month or two, getting youth visas in another country and working there for a while, that sort of thing. All stuff she'd never touch.\n\nI get pretty bad FOMO from social media and the media in general so I try to stay away from that stuff, but it's got me thinking that maybe I'm expecting too much out of my relationship? I don't really have a marker for comparison. My own parents have been divorced for my whole life so they're not really a model for a good relationship.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to ask is - am I overthinking this?

So here's the basics, I went to highschool and was an angsty kid with questionable fashion choices and a wannabe emo phase for much of my time in highschool. I wasn't terribly popular or unpopular, I was for most purposes really average.

We shared some interests, values and her meme game was on point. I began reconsidering my decision to cut people off and I started adding a select few people I had dismissed and realized they were actually also perfectly nice and normal people and maybe I wasn't the only cringy one in highschool. \n\n\nI started with the star of this post, a girl I had a somewhat adversarial relationship, an adversarial relationship that might've been a mutual-ish attraction or teenage angst. I should point out that, it has been 6 or 7 years since we graduated and grown as people so I'm sure that those feelings on both end if they existed are gone now. I've had relationships, so has she. I felt bad about how I treated her and how obnoxious I was. She returned it and we had a very brief chat about why we were on the opposite ends of Canada. I mentioned at the end that I wouldn't mind getting doing a zoom call or something along those lines to catch up. Her response was: \n\n\"Awesome catching up yes!! All the best \u263a\ufe0f\" (in the previous message I had basically ended the conversation wanting to keep it short and sweet and not force a long talk). \n\n\nI showed the message to my at the time girlfriend and she told me she didn't think she was that interested in being more than Facebook friends. But, she doesn't seem that guarded whenever I respond to her stories on Instagram and she feels actually engaged when she replies. \n\nSo I'm wondering what's the best way to reach out and actually offer the zoom hangout?

well i had this feeling. \n\ni\u2019ve cried to this man multiple times asking if he is telling me the truth about the situation, to which he looked me in the eyes and promised me he was. \n\n(i suffer from mental health problems and take medication daily. not justifying any actions but i didn\u2019t want to leave this context out).\n\nanyway, we had another conversation about it recently and told me he had in fact lied to my face about this girl. i felt so betrayed and in the moment i pushed him. \n\ni pushed him and in the exact same push , pushed myself off him. i apologised right away and sat at the end of the bed, as i know i did wrong. i did just loose my head for a split second after finding out he had lied\u2026 i felt so betrayed.\n\ni am not justifying my actions, however growing up in an abusive household and only ever having past abusive relationships, i flipped for a second and my past really showed. \n\nhe is the complete opposite of this, his household is so loving and caring and i can see why this push was such a big deal to him. and i regret it with all my heart. \n\nwe\u2019ve decided to keep the relationship in tact, but to prioritise working on ourselves whilst dating as it\u2019s clear i definitely have a lot of healing of my own to do. \n\nthe reason i\u2019m writing this post asking for help is because of my boyfriends older brother. his brother similar to me has been in abusive relationships in the past, and i knew he wouldn\u2019t forgive me for this push. \n\nRegardless i tried to do the right thing and message him. in this message i explained that i understand if he doesn\u2019t fuck with me after what happened but i love my boyfriend and i would love to just have a chat with him (the brother) because although what i did was ugly it really was an honest quick mistake. \n\nplease bare in mind ive only had a handful of conversations with his brother. i don\u2019t really know him like that, and he doesn\u2019t know me that well either. \n\nbut the messages i got back has really effected me. to put it short - he called me an abuser. he said whether i like it or not i\u2019m an abuser and my boyfriend is a victim of domestic violence on my behalf. he said i\u2019m  a jealous pathetic little girlfriend who needs to get my shit together. he called me pure evil and said he\u2019s dated girls just like me in the past and that he thinks i\u2019m using my past to justify my actions. he said my mental health problems are not my boyfriends responsibility. i agree with the last statement. but the rest of it really destroyed me. maybe i\u2019m not who i thought i was? i feel like i\u2019m having what feels like a big identity crisis. \n\ni explained to him that i\u2019m not trying to justify anything i\u2019m taking full responsibility and that\u2019s why i messaged him, because i don\u2019t want it to come across like i don\u2019t care and i\u2019m pretending it never happened. i still haven\u2019t got a reply. \n\ni feel like the same way his brother seen this situation and regressed back to his past and associated it with me (like saying he\u2019s dated girls like me).. i regressed back to my past and just seen red when i felt angry and betrayed. i understand how his past is effecting how he perceives me but he thinks i\u2019m just using mine to justify my actions. \n\nbut i keep thinking of what he said to me and it\u2019s really getting to me. as most people who have been in abusive households etc, i wanted to believe i\u2019d be the one to break the cycle of abuse. i lost my cool for a second and i regret it with my whole heart but now i truly feel like i\u2019m an awful person. \n\nbecause i\u2019ve been seeing my boyfriend for over a year, i have become good friends with a lot of his friends. however a lot of them have unfollowed me on instagram since the fight. i know it\u2019s only instagram, but my boyfriend hasn\u2019t spoke to these people about the incident, so perhaps his brother has? but if his brothers telling people what\u2019s happened in the same way he messaged me, i get why they\u2019re going to dislike me\u2026 but he\u2019s putting it the coldest way ever. \n\ni feel really ganged up on.. i love these people but i\u2019m not there to speak to anyone myself. \n\nsince the fallout ive been looking into going back to therapy but it\u2019s all so expensive. i can\u2019t go until my student loan comes in (september). ive barely slept , ate or left my bedroom at all to be honest. i keep having bad dreams about abuse and waking up in such a panic and filled with anxiety. i feel so awful that i pushed my boyfriend. \n\ni\u2019m a student quite far away from home and i just feel lost. \n\nsince moving away my boyfriends family has become like my family and i\u2019m so gutted i\u2019ve let them down but i haven\u2019t even had chance to really talk about it with anyone. \n\ni want to tell my friends or family what has happened, but i don\u2019t want to show them the messages i received off his brother. they won\u2019t want me to continue seeing him or to be around his brother as i am far from home. his brother also has quite a public career that i would never want to tarnish even tho i\u2019d only show my friends, i wouldn\u2019t want them to think anything of him and not support him. this is my first ever redddit post i just don\u2019t know what to do.\n\ni\u2019m ashamed of what i did, i really am trying to better myself for myself and for my boyfriend who i love very much. but i can\u2019t shake the feeeling that i\u2019ve become what i\u2019ve never wanted to be. \n\ni just need advice\u2026 \ni just need someone to talk to.", "title": "Advise please - am i an abuser??"}, {"created_utc": 1624721507, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/o8d0by/i_m26_have_a_problem_in_dealing_with_potential/", "num_comments": 8, "score": 1, "selftext": "For starters, I\u2019m what you consider a late bloomer.

Eventually we both admitted to our feelings for eachother and pretty much prepared to date. \n\nThen she went to the beach and she started talking to me about how when I go to college she wouldn\u2019t hold me back, I asked her what this meant and she basically told me that she was scared that I would find someone better in college. I let her know this insulted me and tried to reassure her that this wouldn\u2019t happen and all seemed well\n\nTill the next day when she suddenly tells me that we shouldn\u2019t date or be romantically involved but could still be friends. Now for a split second I thought she had been leading me on this entire time and I got mad. I shouldn\u2019t have but if been else on before and it felt like it was happening again. She also refused to explain to me why she felt this way, she said it had nothing to do with me going to college and eventually told me that she was uncomfortable with how fast we were moving. She said she felt uncomfortable with some of the stuff I said (I admitted to daydreaming about her which she also said) and that we would NEVER date and she was firm on that. This confused me because she had said the same stuff and we had had sexual conversations that she said she was perfectly comfortable with so I made no senses. But, fine\u2026I told her we could be friends and she said we will talk in a week. \n\nThis didn\u2019t last long as the following night she texted me again and asked if I was ready to talk before telling me that she just needed some time to think. We started talking again and eventually the spark was returning. She said she still liked me a lot and she went back to saying some of the same stuff that she said had made her uncomfortable. Thinking that was some episode she had I went along with it and once again, we were on the verge of dating HOWEVER she actually straight up told me that while she was glad I still like her she has no guarantee that I\u2019ll feel the same way in the future. I told her not to worry about that\n\nThe next day she was noticeably less chatty, the next day was even worse, and tonight she didn\u2019t say a word to me until I said something and she responded 3 hours later telling me that it wasn\u2019t going to work and that her family doesn\u2019t even want us to be friends because I got mad at her that night. Now, this doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. First of all, her parents would have made her block me like last time which they didn\u2019t, she recorded several snaps for me with her parents in the background since that argument, thirdly she wouldn\u2019t have been texting me the way she had had she shown her parents and they had gotten upset, and lastly, she has already lied about similar stuff before. Like the first time when she said we should just be friends she told me two different stories, even before that when she blocked me she made up an obviously fake story as to why it happened because she didn\u2019t want to tell me it was her parents.\n\nAnyway I told her that I was ok if this was her decision but I wanted to talk sometime soon if it was ok with her which she read but hasn\u2019t replied to.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I think may be going on. She\u2019s afraid of me losing interest in the future. She\u2019s already told me that heartbreak was her biggest fear and I think she\u2019s letting that get the best of her. I think she\u2019s so afraid she\u2019ll have her heart broken that she won\u2019t take the chance.

Our latest dispute is about a trampoline. Or, I guess it\u2019s more about communication about trampolines. Here goes:\n\nI despise trampolines. Mostly the noise (from the trampoline itself and the children jumping and screaming) but I also really don\u2019t want one for our garden as the monstrosity occupies a good deal of area. Since me and my partner moved to an apartment outside of the city center, I have often made a point of my dislike for them (more or less humorously). While I probably rant more, I know that my partner sees eye to eye with me on this. He has even, jokingly, said that trampolines should be made illegal. Anyway, the place we ended up buying has a beautiful garden that is shared between four residents. I love this garden.\n\nI\u2019ve recently come home after being away for a while. My partner and I went to my parents for dinner. Somehow we started talking about noise in the neighbourhood, and I mentioned trampolines as a source of such irritation. My partner suddenly says \u201cYeah, that will soon be the case for us as well\u201d, and it turns out our neighbour has her mind set on buying a trampoline for her kid, to place in our shared garden. \n\nI\u2019m upset by this and ask questions as to when he heard and if she is allowed to do it. My partner followed up by saying that it\u2019s to be expected when you share a garden with others. I said that I think one has to apply formally so the other residents may have a vote. I was upset about this happening, and while my partner seemed more acceptant of the trampoline, I never thought of the conversation as a quarrel. My parents shared their thoughts too. My father is a former property manager and had some insights on the matter, agreeing that our neighbour should have applied formally. When I asked my partner if he was sure that our neighbour didn\u2019t plan to present her plans formally to the rest of the household, he didn\u2019t answer but said \u201cThis should rather be discussed between four eyes.\u201d That caught me off guard. I didn\u2019t answer him and the mood was strained from there on. It felt like he labeled my reaction as indecent and pointed it out in front of my parents. It felt embarrassing and uncalled for, as if I could not allow myself to be let down by something so impersonal as a trampoline. I was tipsy from the wine and I guess I liked being able to share my frustration on the matter with people I trust. However, I never criticised my partner or yelled or anything like that. My parents didn\u2019t seem to mind. \n\nI was quite angry at my partner after we had left and he was angry at me. He said that he felt attacked by me and that it was obvious for my parents that we disagreed on this matter, which he thought was embarrassing. It makes me question if his statement on talking privately is innocent and that I shouldn\u2019t have felt hurt because of it?

My heart rate has been skyrocketing, and my stomach goes through stints of hurting, too.\n\nThe thing is, none of these feelings were there before the proposal! I felt completely happy, and only immediately after I put on the ring did I begin having this awful physical anxiety about everything. I am currently in talks to get a therapist, and my partner and I have couples counseling every week now but it hasn't caused any lasting improvements.

However, I am caught up on this thought in my head that I don't feel the way I should about him. I'm not sure what the \"Correct\" way to feel is, and part of me wishes someone would just spell it out for me to make me stop feeling insane.\n\nAm I ignoring something here? I talked to two therapists about it briefly and neither of them seemed to think it was any reason to break up or stop the engagement, and though their words comforted me at the time, the same anxiety keeps popping up each day no matter how hard I try to stop it!\n\nPlease help me, I don't want to lose my fiance but these feelings are overwhelming and causing huge stress in my life and forcing me to question my relationship I had no problems with beforehand.\n\nTL;DR: Was proposed to by fiance, immediate anxiety and panic attacks that have lasted these last two weeks off and on followed.

From the beginning of the relationship, he\u2019s been jealous of other men. I\u2019ve had male friends that I\u2019ve known for years that he basically told me that I can\u2019t hang out with them alone. In a previous relationship, his ex had cheated on him, so he has a lot of anxiety and distrust related to that. Because of this, I begrudgingly agreed. \n\nFrom there, things were getting better for awhile. I started seeing the man I fell for again. He\u2019s funny, smart, and genuinely caring. He\u2019s the first guy I\u2019ve ever actually seen a future with. When I\u2019m with him, it feels like home. He says that one of the first things that attracted him to me was my sense of humor. \n\nThough more recently (last few months), it feels like I\u2019m having to walk on eggshells when I\u2019m talking to him. We joke on each other a lot and it\u2019s generally all in fun. We have had several blow up fights over the last couple of months because of jokes I\u2019m making that I just honestly do not understand. \n\nFor example,on Friday, we were discussing over the phone how many past relationships we\u2019ve had. He said he had only had 2 serious girlfriends besides me. I jokingly said \u201cwell, that explains a lot!\u201d He immediately got upset and said that it was so disrespectful and how I thought I was better than him because I\u2019ve had more relationships. I quickly came back and told him that I definitely did not mean it that way and explained that I was kidding. He didn\u2019t believe me and said that I don\u2019t \u201crespect\u201d him. \n\nI apologized and the argument lasted for another hour. I told him that I really didn\u2019t want to fight and reiterated that I\u2019ve had a really stressful week. He came back and said \u201cso? A lot of people have stressful weeks\u201d. That really hurt me and I said I needed some space. \n\nAfter taking some space, we made plans today to go to the beach. We were on our way there and I brought up a way to try and move on past fights in the future. I suggested that once the person genuinely apologizes, we take that and close it up. He said it\u2019s easier said than done. \n\nI tried to see if he had any suggestions and he didn\u2019t. He was quiet for a long time after that.

Our interactions were very minimal as we don't work in the same departments but I could already tell then that she was not my type of person. There was something off with her energy, as though she had an expectation for people to suck up to her to even afford a conversation. I suppose being popular on IG and having a relatively high social ranking/status would make some people have such warped expectations. She is also absolutely beautiful and knows it, I suppose that too played a role in how she conducted herself. I however don't quite like having such people in my social circle. I don't enjoy the tussles that come with dealing with people with such complexes. I'm generally more reserved and private, some might say somewhat introverted. So myself and her are total polar opposites and no one would figure for her to ever be my partner. Fast forward to post Covid national lockdown, our sister company had to downsize and cut down on rent to stay afloat, this led to us having to move into their offices and operate under one building. This is when the fun begins. Generally the age range of most employees between both companies is 25 to 35 so we all related well for the most part. This meant for me that I got to spend a lot more time with my now gf too. The more I got to know her, I began to develop feelings for her, against all better judgement. We started flirting quite heavily whenever we were in each other presence and progressed to a physical relationship. \\*\\*.\n\nThis is pretty much when our love story begun and ended. We started spending quite a lot of time together, she would spend nights at my house, we'd go out together with friends and generally have plenty fun together. Through this I would come to one daunting realisation that ultimately led to the demise of our beautiful relationship. Major red flag for me was the fact that she would always act out of character in the presence of an audience. She would start speaking to me in very condescending ways and cracking untasteful jokes at my expense. Things she would generally never do when it's just us two, she would perpetuate relentlessly whenever there was an audience. Generally it was always small things, but its the cumulation of those small things that would drive me crazy. Whenever I would react, which was seldom, she would find ways to twist the narrative and make me look like a deranged partner. Many a time I would find myself having to deal with and correct falsified narratives she will have made. Now note that most people in our circle of friends were so wrapped around her finger so much so that they would literally take anything she would say as being the gospel. I guess this is the allure of having a friend with such a high social ranking. It got really exhausting for me because I just didn't quite understand why she felt the need to continuously do all these unnecessary things for attention but at the detriment of peace between us. I asked her to stop acting out in front of people until I gave up and just stopped going out with her because I realised that having people around her was a trigger. At this point we had a good number of mutual friends and I stopped hanging with them in her presence. I would literally only have a drink with them in her absence and I guess it became apparent to her what I was doing. This was all an effort to avoid conflict though.\n\nShe ended up breaking up with me lamenting that she felt unwanted, unloved, that I didn't give her attention anymore and that I had become stand offish. This of course called for a conversation, which we had and I deeply expressed how in love I was with her but just couldn't deal with the person she becomes whenever there is an audience around us. She refused to acknowledge any blame for any grievances I had raised. She at one point went as far as to tell me that she had a guy in mind she had always wanted to date and that she wanted to explore that. So ultimately I let her move on with her life and also allowed myself to move on with my life. It was the most difficult time of my life being separated from her. I went online to seek solace one night when I just couldn't sleep. I had this itch to at least understand her personality and understand why she behaved in certain ways. I came across a channel on Youtube: **DoctorRamani** and that night my mind was blown away. She is a clinical psychologist who specialises in narcissistic behavioural traits. I learnt a lot of what type of person she could be. Not that anything is set in stone that she is a narcissist but I was heavily inclined to believe so from my observation of her behaviour. I watched multiple other videos on how to get over an ex and the common rhetoric was **no contact.** I started to employ that with her, though difficult since we have mutual friends. However it was effective enough to where I stopped engaging with her over texts and such.\n\nI managed to maintain the somewhat no contact for a few weeks before she weaseled her way back to my house this one time off of the pretence of dropping off my jacket. We hade some drinks and she ended up spending the night. Yes we had sex. After that episode is when things started to change between us. She immediately started acting like she was my gf again. Shortly after, she had a trip out of town, so she left her car at my house and I dropped her off at the Airport. Picked her up the following Monday around midday and drove home so she could get her car. Once home, she said she needed some rest so she would just take a nap and leave later that evening for her house. This is when it all came full circle for me; she then asked if she could hold onto my other set of *house keys* since I had to leave for work after lunch. She always had my house keys btw but gave them back when she broke it off with me. Anyway, I gave them to her and left. In a sense I guess we could say that was when we got back together. Nothing was said to that regard but we have pretty much been a couple again since. Not at the time, I was elated to have her back in my life. It is now a few weeks later, may 5 weeks and I have my doubts about our future as a couple. She seems to really want to give it a try but I think I am still incredibly scarred from how she used to behave around people. I only ever had one issue with her. What terrifies me most is the fact that she said she never really understood what my issues were in the first place and the fact that she then said there was a guy she had always wanted to date. I find myself holding back and not allowing myself to be fully immersed in this relationship because I keep thinking, why are you with me if there is another guy you'd like to date. Why are we even trying to date again if you say you don't understand the key things I always complained about in out relationship. That only means she is going to continue with that nasty behaviour that I don't like whenever we are around people and I personally can not settle for that ever again.\n\nI still care a lot for her but I just have so many reservations in my head that I even find it difficult to be aroused by her. I wonder I give her the benefit of the doubt and just explore what could be or just trust my instinct that tells me that this is only a ticking time bomb.\n\nI sincerely appreciate your feedback.

When we passed under street lights, the fogginess was much more intense and you could see every little smudge on the glass. \n\nI noticed there were a lot of smudges. I couldn't tell what most of them were except for maybe two. The first one was clearly a handprint, just not an entire hand, only the fingertips (there were 5 fingertips arranged like a spread out hand and that's how I could tell it was a handprint). It was right above my head, near the top of the windshield. The second one looked to me like part of a footprint, and it was right in front of me. I'm not sure about this one because there weren't toeprints, it was just what seemed like the side of a foot with part of the heel, and it would have been roughly the size of my foot. I'm sure they were from inside, because as I said, it was raining all day and the wipers were on the entire time, so if they were from the outside, they probably would have been wiped. \n\nThis is my boyfriend's car btw.

I started wondering if there has been anyone else there, and if... well, something happened on the passenger seat there. I don't want to immediately jump to these assumptions, but I can't seem to imagine a logical scenario where these smudges would appear innocently (with the type of smudges and their placement.)

My fianc\u00e9 loves our hometown, some of his best friends still live there, as do both his parents. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I love each other dearly, I'd say we're generally very good at communicating and taking care of each others worries, needs and emotions, and I'm incredibly happy to have him! We're getting married next year and want to try for kids pretty soon after. The only topic that's a bit of a sore point is that his ideal future would involve moving back to A when we have kids, so they can be close to their grandparents. He grew up with his grandparents just around the corner, and he wants our kids to have a solid relationship with theirs. \n\nI agree that it'd make many things easier to be near both sets of grandparents, being able to drop the kids off over the weekend or just for general support, and I would like to be close to my mum. I don't think they'd necessarily have a worse relationship if we lived 190miles away though - I grew up with one set of grandparents 300 miles away, and I still loved them dearly, visited multiple times a year etc.\n\nIt's just that I can't picture myself ever moving away from where we live now. It's my home. I love this city with all my heart, all my friends are here, I know the streets and the best bars and caf\u00e9s and which parks to avoid and where to find the best entertainment and the best view. I love the culture, the opportunities and the liveliness here. I've been here 10 years and it's 100% my home.  My fianc\u00e9 and I also each have a cousin living here in B, who are like brothers to us and would make for great uncles IMHO. The city can also be a bit of a rough s\\*\\*\\*hole though, and it's probably not the most sheltered place to be raising kids. (Maybe comparable to NYC, and A would be... Boston or something?) \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 argues that if we lived back in A, we could do weekend trips to B to see friends/go to caf\u00e9s etc, and having family around to support us is gonna be more important than friends and bars. I absolutely don't think we'd be doing regular fun weekend trips for pleasure with an infant or toddler though, and argued that it makes more sense to me to live in B and visit the grandparents in A on weekends! It's only a 1.5h train ride after all.\n\nIt's become a bit of a sensitive topic, because when he first brought it up I said I could maybe consider moving back, but the more I think about and imagine it, the more horrifying the thought becomes. I would be starting from scratch, with no friends, a baby (which doesn't make socialising and making friends easier, I've heard), in a city I hate. I love my friends and while I'm aware that I'll be seeing them much less once we have kids and relationships are going to change, it's important to me to hold on to that bit of my identity as much as I can, even after becoming a mum.\n\nI'm worried I'd start resenting my fianc\u00e9 for making me leave my friends and life behind, even if it'd be the better choice for our children. I don't want to be selfish, and I know my arguments are. But I'm having a really tough time with this. Has anyone had to make a similar decision and what did you do...?\n\nTL;DR  \nMy fianc\u00e9 would like to move back to our hometown once we have kids so they can be close to their grandparents, but I hate our hometown and don't want to live there.", "title": "My fianc\u00e9 (27M) wants to move cities after we have kids and I(28F) don't."}, {"created_utc": 1623145158, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nv0y5q/i_think_ive_fallen_in_love_with_my_housemate/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I think I've fallen in love with my housemate"}, {"created_utc": 1623144998, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nv0wsd/i_repeatedly_get_guys_who_want_sex_and_no/", "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "Whether I meet guys through work, mutual friends, or from online dating, every guy has shown an interest in having sex.\n\nI would never date a colleague but there\u2019s two guys in another department (one is a manager) who has shown interest and asked to take me out.

I recently met this rather attractive girl at a dorm gathering about a week ago. Immediately, I noticed that she was very inclusive of me and offered me drinks. I was taken aback by her kindness and I genuinely thought she was an amazing person. Later that night, after most people left the room, she and two of her other girlfriends stayed to talk with me. It started off innocent enough with some small talk but it proceeded to me talking about my ex girlfriend. At the end of the night, we all began to share deeper stories of ourselves and I could tell that everyone was a lot more comfortable with each other now. Flash forward to about two nights ago, the girl I liked began to talk to me more and I definitely started hitting it off with her more. Throughout the night we started to flirt more and more and at one point she even invited me to use the same restroom as her. I was definitely a bit weirded out but I didn\u2019t think too much of it. As the night progressed we began to drink more and eventually she and I left to go grab something. We ended up getting back pretty late and she offered for me to come back to her room so we could drink some more. Before we went in though she mentioned that she told her roommate earlier to go and sleep with her boyfriend and that the room would be to ourselves for the night. However, after getting in we saw that there were people passed out in her room so we ended up going outside to hangout and we ended up staying up and talking till five AM in the morning. Judging by these hints I feel like she has some interest in me but when I snap chatted her the next morning she took a bit to respond and a lot of her responses were kind of bland and didn\u2019t ask a lot of questions like an interested person usually would. Please I\u2019d like some advice on what to do and hopefully figure out if she really is into me or not.\n\nTl:dr\nI\u2019m not sure if this girl I like likes me back.

We have a few problems in our relationship that I think personally are too far gone to resolve, my feelings for her just aren\u2019t the same anymore. \n\nWe don\u2019t see eye to eye on a lot of things, we have tried to compromise and I guess at this stage I would say we have compromised on a lot of things, but the arguments in between have changed it for me. I\u2019d say one thing that is still recurring in our relationship is that she gets quite upset about some things that would otherwise not make me batt and eyelid, and I\u2019m sure she could say the same for me. These arguments usually explode because she does say things that attempt to make me feel quite bad about anything I\u2019ve done to offend her and I defend myself and explain my position because of how 0-100 she goes, and she calls it gaslighting, anyway, that\u2019s not the point. \n\nShe does a lot for me, I couldn\u2019t ask for a more attentive girlfriend, seriously. She buys my parents flowers every time we visit and chocolates and surprise gifts, if she does it for them I\u2019m sure you can imagine she treats me well. Furthermore, I have my own issues with mental health - some milder depression and anxiety that can be quite bad. But these aren\u2019t reasons to stay with someone, because of what she does for me? \n\nAnd I can see now that she clearly loves me more than I her, and that\u2019s okay and natural, but the gap is widening every day and she is getting affected by it, but that doesn\u2019t mean she wants to end things, she doesn\u2019t - she\u2019s suggested lots of Holidays and gym sessions together etc. I can see in a lot of arguments where she gets insecure about something that wouldn\u2019t really affect me probably come back to this emotional gap we have, and it\u2019s not fair to put her through that. I\u2019m not attentive enough or at least I\u2019m not as attentive as her. I am currently in my own pit in life and I need to get out of it, she tries her best but it\u2019s not what will help me, I need some time alone and she shouldn\u2019t have to be with me while I\u2019m pretty much reaching vacancy in the relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m mistreating her at this point, or pushing her away, I\u2019m trying my best to pretend everything is okay until I figure out what to do, but sooner or later she will realise and it will hurt her. The other problem is her mother is an alcoholic and their relationship recently escalated and they won\u2019t be seeing each other for a long time. \n\nHow do I end things with someone so gentle and kind and with other things going on in their life? I want to grow with her and the idea of forgetting her \u201cstory\u201d and her family and her friends hurts, it\u2019s a whole door shutting but at the same time I can see that even when we are away, I don\u2019t properly miss her the way I have missed her when we first met.

We\u2019ve been technically in a relationship since September, but have known each other for nearly four years, so when we got together it was a pretty natural transition. I\u2019ve also known my Bf\u2019s twin for that long and she and I hit it off faster than Bf and I did at first. Last summer during the heat of the pandemic, the twins were the only people I hung around besides my family and it was a good couple of months.

I was having fun still at this point, braving through the off handed comments, until Bf said that his sister wanted to punch me in the face again, to which I responded to her instead of my Bf, \u201cif that happens our friendship is done, plain and simple.\u201d Which was a daring statement on my part because I\u2019ve never spoken out like that before, but then she said that it wouldn\u2019t be much of a loss. My Bf said nothing, never defended me, or called his sister out, just sat silent and let her talk to me like that. That ruined my mood for the day, so I tried to finish up the game as fast as I could. When it was time for me to leave is simply told him that I didn\u2019t like how they treated me and left quickly so I didn\u2019t get upset.

Not gonna lie I was a bit sad that he still decided to go, but he didn't have the chance to meet my granddad so I didn't want to take him to funeral as it would be just awkward.\nSo fast forward he wrote me that he will be back this evening and well I wrote if he can stay at my place as I didn't want to be alone, but well he said he will see if he will not be tired. As I still wasn't home (was at sisters place), I wrote that if he stayed he can write me any time and I will take taxi to go home when he arrives.\nI gave him choice obviously, but I kind of expected of him to stay at my place.\nAt that time I didn't even think of options staying at his as I had work the next day and had a few drinks with family before.\nWell I got mad at him and said that I won't stay at his place next day as we promised.\n\nWas I being manipulative with my boyfriend, because he didn't choose what I wanted? \nAlso I know that after airsoft you can get bruises, so maybe I was in wrong to ask staying at my place even though I knew he will be tired?\n\nTL;DR - I had a funeral and wanted for my BF to stay at my place after he arrived from airsoft to not feel lonely, but he was too tired and said he will stay home", "title": "I (F22) felt hurt that my BF (M22) didn't stay at my place when I was grieving."}, {"created_utc": 1623142824, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nv0df3/should_i_tell_my_exs_gf_that_hes_cheating_on_her/", "num_comments": 14, "score": 1, "selftext": "Throwaway account because I'm not sure if he's on reddit or not. Also posted on other subs.\n\nFor context, me (F) and my ex, lets call him Alex (not real name) were best friends in high school. I had a crush on Alex's best friend and Alex was dating Jessica (not real name). Me and Alex went to the same school, Jessica went to a different school. Eventually, Jessica broke up with Alex and we developed feelings. We only started having feelings for each other AFTER they broke up, so I was never the third person. Jessica broke up with him because she got pissed off bc Alex didn't like her hanging out with one of her guy friend. Long story short, me and Alex never dated but we did go on dates etc. for around a year until there was some problems. Even though we never got into a serious relationship, he considers me to be his ex-girlfriend. He ended up getting back together with Jess and I dated another guy. When they first got back together, Alex still had feelings for me (I didn't know until we graduated hs) and he would sometimes mention my name in front of her.We're all in our third year of college now but we still keep in touch because we're both in the same group of friends. I see him more as a friend than an ex bc of the fact that we never actually dated. However, Jess absolutely HATES me. She sees me as a homewrecker (which I don't understand because I only started liking Alex months after she broke up with him and so did Alex.) and she believes we still have feelings for each other (we don't. I have a boyfriend).\n\nAnyways, Alex and Jess never had sex because Alex wanted to keep her \"pure\" or whatever. The thing is, he sleeps around a lot without Jess knowing. Sometimes he pays prostitutes or has one night stands. I've always felt bad for Jess and I told Alex that I think what he's doing is wrong, considering everything is happening behind Jess's back. He told me that he really loves Jess, he just needs someone to fulfill his sexual needs, which Jess couldn't do. From what I see, Alex really does love Jess if I ignored the fact that he's a compulsive cheater. I mentioned to him that I feel guilty for not telling her because if I were in her shoes, I would've want someone to tell me. I haven't heard from Alex in quite a while. Yesterday, my best friend, Luna (not real name) called me apologizing because she slept with Alex. I honestly don't see Alex as an ex anymore so I wasn't mad or hurt. I was just confused why she would apologize to me when Alex has a whole actual girlfriend. Luna says she doesn't feel guilty towards Jess because Jess has always been kinda rude to us. I started considering to tell Jess again when Luna told me that she slept with Alex a week after Jess had given her virginity to Alex. I feel really bad for her. Especially because at this point EVERYONE but her knows.\n\nHere are my considerations:\n\n1) As I said before: Jess hates me and thinks me and Alex still have feelings for each other.\n\n2) Alex is still my best friend. We are in a very tight friendship circle. I'm afraid to ruin things if I told on him.\n\n3) Jess would most likely not believe me\n\n4) I considered creating a fake instagram account to tell Jess.\n\n5) I don't have any proof other than Alex and Luna's words, which were all over call so there is no screenshot or anything.\n\n6) All my friends believe I should mind my own business. They are all very indifferent towards Jess because she's honestly not the really nicest person. However, I still believe she deserves to know.\n\ntl;dr: i know my ex cheated on his gf multiple times and i feel guilty for not telling her.\n\nI'm very confused know.

I feel lost about how to feel and if I should just stop beating this dead horse.\n\nHey reddit - I have a best friend who I went to work and uni with and she moved across the country to be with a new man. I try and keep our friendship going but regularly texting and calling her, talking about things going on in our lives. I try and always be positive because I know how annoying it is to be a friend who only makes contact when they want to cry about something. In the past 6 months I have noticed she never initiates contact and takes a long time to reply to any communication, if at all. I have been recommended by family and a counsellor to cut ties with her and try to make some new friends.\n\nRecently, my partner and I had a fight over a massive miscommunication. I called her up at the time not knowing what to do, and my friend encouraged me to leave my partner and admitted that she never liked him and thought I could do better. A few days after this, i got a text from this friend asking how I was. I was excited about this text because it was the first time she had initiated any contact and I excitedly replied about all the things going on in my life (lots of good things) and asked her how she was. Her response was simple, 'did you end it with him?' I was gutted by that response but I sent back a long message about how we went to counselling to work things out and all the details about what had happened. No response.\n\nThe next day I received a text from her stating that she was 'over it' and didn't want to be my friend anymore. It was salt in the wound after being slowly ghosted the last 6 months but maybe I had to hear it.\n\nMy question is, has anyone experienced this before? How did you cope?

She agreed to this but asked \u201cis it really an issue for you because we work at the same company?\u201d. I said yes because I didn\u2019t want it to impact each other badly should something bad happen or people gossip, even though we work in different functions. This was the first time I had gotten involved with anyone from work so I wanted to tread very carefully but now in hindsight lesson learnt!\n\nShe initiated the dates and early communication and asked for my number. We went on two dates and on the second date she invited me to her place and ended up having sex at her place. After the second date, I realized I was still thinking about her a lot...especially as she said after the sex \u201cit\u2019s not a question if I love you but when I love you\u201d. This had stuck in my head. I took that as a sign this girl was pretty into me...in fact at one stage during the week after while at work she texted me saying \u201equick makeout session?\u201c while we were both at work! She was willing to find a secret spot! So if that is not a sign she is into me, what is? \n\nEven when we would walk together we would at times hold hands.\n\nWe have developed a good bond where we also confided in each other about others at work and situations to help each other because I also provide coaching to the younger associates at the company. So I thought starting off as friends was a good approach but of course I was slowly beginning to care about her and it showed.\n\nEven though we only had two dates, we have been flirting for two months. The chemistry was there, but I also knew she was seeing others. No problem.\n\nsoon after the second date, ramadan approached where I told her out of respect in advance that I wouldn\u2019t be able to meet up for 4 weeks due to fasting but that we would keep in touch which we did via chat and etc and one week after begin of ramadan i popped by to her office just to say hi and make her feel like I have not ignored her and am interested, especially because during the second date after sex I left her place without sleeping over and I noticed she was not very happy about me not sleeping over but I had my own reasons which did not relate to her.\n\nWhen we reconnected, she did say she thought it was strange how I left and that she wanted me to stay and I explained the reasons and she said would be happy to meet again. But needless to say, she assumed that me leaving her place meant I was not interested in her.\n\nDuring the second date and prior to being invited to her place, we talked as we walked and spoke about different things and i asked her about her past relationships and vice versa. She told me about the most recent one from 2018 and who is based in Germany and that this was the toughest one as she really loved him but  since he didn\u2019t move out of Germany with her they broke up.  I am not sure if that was the main reason but it was certainly decisive. I knew the way she spoke about him that it was a red flag for me because I could tell she still thought about him.  Despite that, we still had a great time and kept the communication going and the flirtation and she invited me to her place and we had sex. According to her it was an awesome full-body orgasm I gave her.\n\nOn Monday 3 weeks ago she pops by to my office (much to my delight) for a short exchange and in the conversation i asked her if she had recently met up with anyone / dated and she hesitated until she finally mentioned that two weeks ago she got the news that her boyfriend will be moving to the city as of June and that she \u201cwants to give that another try\u201d. Clearly this has been in the pipeline because especially in these times, you don\u2019t move out of a country and find a new job in one day.  What annoyed me even more is how she kept flirting with me in my office because when I asked her \u201ehey do you notice the glow on my face from the fasting? It helps to cleanse the body\u2019\u201c...and she replied with \u201eI prefer the other glow\u201c with a smile!  That is the after sex glow?..\n\ni was hurt because even though we did say we would be casual, the fact that we go so close in those two dates and she had AGREED to meet up again and she had KNOWN about her ex coming back but was still flirting with me for another date and saying I am a \"fascinating guy\" and \"want to get to you know you more\" and basically gave all the signs of interest more than casual, but maybe I misread it? \n\nShe also said she was not sure if she wanted to go back to her ex or not and was figuring it out and realized she \u201cwould be stupid not to give that a try\u201d.. she also  said i should not be expecting her to be so open about her feelings because we only met twice, but I also think it would have been appropriate NOT to keep flirting and agreeing on another date as soon as Ramadan was over because of the incoming ex. It felt like I was thus led on to fill the void of her ex while she was figuring out seeing him again. In fact, she also said that she had dated so many people to see if she can move on from him / get over him in the last 3 years. Hmmm...\n\nThe conversation got a bit heated and she said \u201c tell me what I can do to make it up to you?\u201d......I had nothing to say to that because I didn\u2019t want to escalate things so I kept silent. I didn\u2019t want to come across like a little boy that had their candy stolen.\n\nShe went back to the office to work and I took the train home. 10 mins later she sends me a voice message:\n\n\u201c hi there, im sorry for getting angry at you when I don\u2019t have a right to be. I\u2019m sorry if you felt I strung you along. I hope we can be friends\u201d\n\nI responded with:\n\n\u201eI remember when I told you once when we first met up that I hope we never hurt the other person at any point of us knowing each other because at the time it felt too good to be true and i guess I was right. I think you now understand what i meant. What I can\u2019t accept that a woman tells me I\u2019m how fascinating she thinks I am and she really likes to get to know me only to turn around and say that someone else is coming to town and she would be stupid not to give that a try. It makes me feel like I was a commodity and was taken for granted. If you truly meant what you said you felt, you would not have caved in so quickly, I think. I  am very hurt by you and there is nothing more I can add to it. It\u2019s a shame, it\u2019s a shame, but it is what it is.\n\nShe replied:\n\n\u201c.....I understand you are hurt and I didn\u2019t want to treat you as a commodity that was not my intention. I do like You and find you very interesting and do want to be friends with you. I have said everything, I like you and I\u2019m sorry for the way it happened, i tried to tell you that I was not available as soon as I figured it out for myself. Please believe me that I didn\u2019t do it on purpose and it was no purpose of mine to play you or string you along and I really don\u2019t think I did string you along but if you feel that way it\u2019s your right, but I hope you know I didnt do it on purpose or to spite you, I actually quite like you, and hope we can keep in touch as friends but that\u2019s obviously for you to decide but I would be happy if we would..\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been 4 weeks and I haven\u2019t responded.\n\nBefore you say I\u2019m a pussy or a little boy for making such a big deal about it because it\u2019s only \u201etwo dates\u201c, I know it was a casual non-exclusive relationship, but the things she \u2018did\u2019 and \u2018said\u2019 at least in my view did not appear like she only saw me as a friend. She even agreed that we we did things \u201emore than friends\u201c and had a \u201cchemistry\u201c and she finds me \u201efascinating and intriguing\u201c.

He was 44 at the time and left a gaping wound in our family. I was 20 at the time, and have brother who was 22 and a little sister who was 15. My mom was 41 and understandably, we all were devastated and coped with the loss and grief on our own terms.\n\nI was always the more level-headed/reasonable one in the family and prefer to talk about feelings that are bothering me as a way of coping and relief. Unfortunately though, I wasn't able to talk with my siblings or mom about my dad for the majority of the past 8 years as it was too emotional for them and they decided it was better for their wellbeing if the subject wasn't addressed at all. This to some level of dismay from my side, it appeared as my dad (as a subject) became some sort of a taboo and he was never mentioned in any capacity. Anniversaries such as his birth day, and even his day of passing, are moments where we do come together and there is a gigantic elephant in the room, but nobody acts on it. I, for one, believe that we should not only grief the loss but also appreciate the time he WAS with us, but I understand that everybody is different in their needs and especially in the time they require to willingly do so.\n\nFast forward to last Sunday, and my mother reached out to my brother and I (we're both married in the meantime and have a family of our own) to come visit as she has something to tell us. By the way she was acting, I could sense a small hint as to where this was leading to, but I stayed composed as we went. Little over a year ago, I had one-on-one with my mom and told her that I would be very supportive if she were to move on and that she, even though she doesn't require my permission in any sorts, can rest easy knowing she has my blessing in doing so. However, once the news broke and she did confirm that she's seeing someone, the reality is that I'm experiencing a multitude of emotions right now..\n\nI was composed and supportive when she told us, and told her that she made the right decision and that if she believes this guy is right for her, she should stick with him. However, it felt like a final nail in the coffin for me, especially as she told us that if things were to get serious, she would eventually move in with him. If that were to happen, the one final memory of my dad (being his house) would disappear as well, and the thought of that crushed me. I really do wish my mom the best and really do want her to be happy. How can I manage my feelings and stay supportive throughout all of this despite the reawakened feelings of grief and loss?

She\u2019s turned one of the home offices (which no one was ever using in 23 years I\u2019ve been in that house) into her own little art studio. I\u2019m happy my mom found a new hobby, but I\u2019m concerned that this new hobby puts my dad (who had heart problems), brother and me in danger. \n\nThe reason I say this is because one of the steps in her acrylic painting processes is to pour this epoxy resin material over the finished product to create a hard/glossy coating (at least that\u2019s how I understand it). It essentially makes it look nice and more presentable. The problem is that this process produces a lot of fumes that smell really\u2026bad. When I first smelled it I thought it was mold or something, until I realized that it was fumes from that epoxy stuff she uses. \n\nBut anyway, the \u201cdanger\u201d comes from the fact that she only does this process at night when everyone is upstairs. Because my mom does this process at night (cuz she\u2019s busy with other stuff during the day), she doesn\u2019t wanna open any windows in the room she\u2019s working in cuz opening the windows at 11 pm scares her I guess. The end result is that the entire house smells like these epoxy resin fumes, and the rest of us sit there inhaling it for a couple of hours several times a week while she does her art projects because there\u2019s absolutely no ventilation (my dad is stingy too so we can\u2019t even turn on the AC at our house until everyone is in bed). \n\nWhat infuriates me is that I noticed she even wears a heavy duty mask while doing this process, which shows me that the fumes should *not* be inhaled and she doesn\u2019t wanna inhale the fumes herself. Yet she can\u2019t bother making sure the house is well-ventilated for the *rest of us* while doing this?? I\u2019ve confronted her about this before, but she says that because the AC is off (which in her mind prevents the \u201cfumes\u201d from spreading to the rest of the house) and we\u2019re in different rooms (despite the fact that I can strongly smell it when I\u2019m on the second floor in the opposite corner of the house) we should be safe.

She brings it up just about every time we visit her, and sometimes it seems like she's on the verge of tears about the possibility of not having any grandchildren. She'll sometimes resort to begging, i.e. \"please promise me I'll have at least *one* grandbaby before I die\" type stuff.\n\nMy youngest sibling is currently in a relatively-new relationship, and it's really awkward for them to have this pressure on such a fresh relationship. My middle sibling has been in a relationship for a very long time, and I think the pressure expresses itself as disappointment for the two of them. I'm the oldest, and I've been single for a while. I currently don't have much of a desire to date anyone at all because I'd rather focus on my career and hobbies right now. I'm not against the idea of having children, but it's not anywhere on the horizon for me right now because I don't even have a girlfriend right now. My mother will not only pressure me to find a girlfriend, but also to find someone who I want to have children with.\n\nSo yes, it affects all of us differently, but the general consensus is that it's uncomfortable and weird (I've confirmed with them in private). At first, it was kind of just this eye-rolling annoyance, but it's starting to seem more and more sincere the longer it goes on. I want to develop my life and my relationships at my own pace. I'm living for myself, and not for my mother's satisfaction.\n\nAs for what I've tried so far, I've tried telling her flat-out that I feel uncomfortable when she asks me to have children, and I've told her that I'd prefer if she didn't bring it up when I'm around. She either doesn't remember it (likely - she's an alcoholic), or doesn't care. I've also tried opening the conversation with her a little more and trying to understand her intent. As I mentioned, I'm not strictly against having children myself, but I'm also open to the possibility of never having children. If I ever do want to raise a child, I would strongly consider adoption as a possibility. If I remotely suggest either adoption or simply living child-free as possibilities, she will get very offended and start pouting.\n\nI'm reaching out here because I imagine this is a situation a lot of folks go through, and I want to know if there's a better way that we can communicate about this. The fact that I've already asked her not to bring it up anymore and that she continues to do so anyway means this is an issue of her not respecting my boundaries, so I'm not sure what the best option is. I want to maintain a healthy relationship with my mother, but I am open to the possibility of reduced contact or other similar strategies (though I'd probably need some suggestions on how to enact something like that). How would you communicate about this issue with her, if you were in my shoes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My mom repeatedly pressures me and my siblings to produce children, and it's making us uncomfortable.

She is self-centered, judgmental, and intolerant. She has shown no real interest in getting to know me or my siblings, but my mom blames our lack of closeness on me. I don't know how to maintain my boundary with SIL without upsetting my mom.**\n\nTo preface this, everyone involved is from the same Asian ethnic group.\n\nI [27F] have only known my SIL [32F] for two years; I was introduced to her a few months before the wedding, at their engagement party, as was the rest of my family. We were all sort of taken aback that they were getting married, but I tried my best to get along with her. At this point in time, things were fine between us.\n\nBut there were some mishaps with the wedding. My SIL didn't print any invitations for my brother's [34M] guests, so none of us got invites. When questioned over why she didn't include our family, she claimed that her mom did it on accident. Soon after this, it came to light that SIL and her mom had organized a party which none of us were invited to (culturally, we should have been). Again, SIL blamed her mom. This really irked me because I felt that SIL was doing this on purpose, but my mom kept insisting that SIL was just following her mom's wishes and couldn't stand up for herself.\n\nAt this point, I still tried to get along with her. But as soon as SIL got married, all semblance of friendliness stopped. Tried to text her? Nothing. Birthday? Nothing. Holidays? Nothing. Dad had a heart attack? Nothing. Grandma died? Nothing. For the first year of their marriage, SIL acted as if she did not need to acknowledge anybody in our family, whether it was me, my siblings, or my parents. This is pretty much when I wrote her off. \n\nOver this past year, she's tried to put in more effort, but everything she does really irritates me. She likes to show up to birthdays without a gift or a card and then make comments like \"Oh, MIL, how could we not throw you a party? We know how much you deserve a nice dinner,\" when she had no part in the organization or cooking. When she's invited to dinner, she never compliments anybody's dishes or helps out in the kitchen. She has a tendency to make rude comments about people's appearances, which she claims is just her giving advice (\"You should use a different shampoo, clearly none of your products are working\"). She's been unemployed for most of her post-college life, but likes giving both me and my siblings unsolicited advice about jobs. She's very judgmental and intolerant, and often makes comments like, \"Did you see that girl? Her hair is *purple!* White people, am I right?\" I hate that she does this because it always makes me feel like she's trying to include me in her bigotry. She has a problem with gay people, she has a problem with atheists. I'm constantly being subjected to her stupid conversations about how she thinks she's better than others because she's religious.\n\nI just don't like her. I have never been close to my brother, so it doesn't bother we at all that I'm not friends with my SIL. But my mom is very angry with me and my sisters, who also dislike her. My mom is constantly saying that we're not giving SIL the benefit of the doubt or putting any effort into getting to know her. That SIL brings up such awkward topics because we're not trying to converse with her. \n\nThe thing is, I have no idea how to make my mom happy while also maintaining my boundary with SIL. I really don't want to develop a relationship with her. She still doesn't try to get to know anyone or even ask how people are when she sees them; the only thing that's different is that she's talking at the dinners she shows up to.

I was an escort for 3 years. I do not hate men for visiting sex workers but I do not approve of cheating. I never asked clients if they were married because it wasn't part of my job. My job was to be supportive, laugh at their corny jokes, and yes, provide sexual pleasure.\n\nDuring my first month of escorting I met a client I was immediately attracted to in a genuine way. He looked very young for his age (I was 24 at the time and he was in his early 40's). He was not wearing a wedding band. And, in fact, over the four years of seeing him as an escort he never once wore a wedding band. I often saw this client for less money than I normally charged. In fact, the first night I saw him I stayed the night for free when he only hired me for an hour. Over the years I saw him regularly and then less regularly. I had a boyfriend and stopped seeing him for a period of time. I met him at some nice resorts a few times. Nothing serious. Just fun.\n\nDuring the pandemic I reached out to him to see if he'd like to see me. I live in So Cal and he's in New York. He was thrilled! I was on a plane the following week. Things were... different. We started texting frequently. Then everyday. Then all day everyday. For as long as I had known him he said he had a girlfriend. Now, sorry to anybody here who's been cheated on by a girlfriend/boyfriend but that does not feel as immoral to me as a wife. If I had a boyfriend who cheated I'd simply kick him to the curb. A husband? After having his babies? That's a different line to cross.\n\nSo, I kept opening up. We got close. We shared a lot about our lives. I learned that he had seen hundreds of escorts over 7 years.\n\nI gave into the feelings because we could be so open. Again, please don't judge me. For those of you who are familiar with sex work, I realize this is extremely unprofessional behavior. It crosses so many boundaries, and, frankly, makes the work look bad. But I was so lonely myself. It had been 6 months or so into the pandemic. Living alone was killing me and it felt amazing to have a genuine connection and amazing sex. And the sex was different too. As an escort, I never minded being objectified. Men do that in real life and it felt empowering to be paid for it. But this felt different. It was real.\n\nSo, I had unprotected sex with him. And in that moment of bliss he told me he loved me. I said it back. And I meant it. The next day he came to my hotel and shared that he was actually married. He apologized for lying and said he should have told me sooner but was overcome with emotions. Shortly afterwards I stopped escorting entirely and that's a whole other story (the industry exhausts me and at the time I had a high paying day job... lost that in the pandemic though...).\n\nI'm writing this now about 6 months later so fucking confused and ashamed of myself. When he told me he was married I thought I might throw up. I felt horrible. I don't even think I would have slept with him for free as a client or done any of those special things if I had known he was married. I regret getting into this mess. But now I have the added guilt of his wife. He told me early on when I started visiting him that his \"girlfriend\" was okay with him having outside sex because he \"needs sex everyday.\"\n\nThe more I learned about the situation... it got worse and worse... this conversation happened over ten years ago once or twice in which his WIFE begrudgingly said he could have sex with escorts but he 1) he couldn't get attached 2) had to use protection and 3) can't see anybody in New York where they live because escorts are a non-threat to the marriage. First, I was a professional hoe for years. I know this is actually highly unlikely. Still, even if this was the case, did she really agree to hundreds of escorts anywhere from $300-$600 an hour? Threesomes? ME? Does she know how explosive sex can be with sex workers for the client?  Doesn't she deserve that kind of lust from her husband?\n\nThis guy has never told me he wants to end his marriage because he is happily married but now wants me to be his girlfriend. For me, I don't have any crazy ideas but I do care about him. I see this ending soon because it's not healthy... clearly... but now on top of the choice to leave this situation.... should I tell her? Deep down I feel like he deceived me because when the moment came, when he finally said he was married, I was already invested. And I feel so stupid.\n\nAgain, I know I am doing something wrong right now but I truly want advice on what to do. If I tell her I could risk him telling my family/colleagues I was an escort. And I have a \"real\" career so that can't happen. To be clear, I don't currently have any escort ads up but he might have some text messages against me. As a researcher at an elite university I highly doubt he'd do that to me but you never know with people. I just feel so bad for her. As an escort I never thought about these things because I provided a service (married men, single men, couples, men overcoming trauma, men with Aspergers, etc. etc), but this feels so shitty. I fucked up. I wish I told him to fuck off when he told me he was married but I was so deep in emotions at that point. Now I am coming back down to earth. \n\nTLDR: I am an escort who saw a client exclusively in the pandemic. Feelings. He lied about being married. Now I feel like an asshole.

I did everything I could to better my mental health, to heal. I regretted taking his love for granted and wished so badly to have him back. I magically wanted a relationship with him after thinking I could never commit myself to someone like that again.\n\n\nOne night he asked me if I wanted to come over and it was like we never ended things. I was so damn happy to be in his presence again. Then school ended and we went home. He confessed he felt as if we were in a relationship and he didn\u2019t know if he was ready. He thought he couldn\u2019t give me what I deserved since he didn\u2019t know what was right for him. (I trust him when he says that so I don\u2019t really think this was an excuse). It hurt terribly.  \n\nFew weeks later, we talk and I end up going to visit him an hour out from me assuming it was friendly terms. We spent the day in the city together and he decided he still wanted me around, but not relationship terms. We still talked regularly, had sex, and showed affection, but acknowledged we can\u2019t be fully committed. It still felt like we were dating anyways. My attachment and love for him grew. I spent every moment with him holding onto every glance I could get. I just knew it might end soon. It kinda fucked me up since those glances are all that replay in my head. \n\n\nA few days ago he promised he wouldn\u2019t leave in a few weeks cus of a change of heart. I still decided not to make any future plans or make any statements referring to a future together. Farthest I would go is a week in advanced. I was supposed to sleepover today and he cancelled on me. Well, surprise! He broke up with me today. He said that he gets too wrapped up into me when we\u2019re together where he doesn\u2019t commit his time to anything else. He said he ends up feeling fulfilled with his day that he doesn\u2019t feel the need to work on any other part of his life. He doesn\u2019t like when that happens and he hates when he gets invested in that way. Then, he said he knew he would hate himself in two days for ending things. So, I gave him a few more days to contemplate and decide with full confidence that\u2019s what he wants to do. \n\nHe said the days I\u2019ve spent with him recently have been the best days he\u2019s had and expressed how much admiration he has for me. It\u2019s been so conflicting to be told you\u2019re loved yet you\u2019re still be left behind. I understand his reasons fully, but it just hurts he\u2019s leaving again. It hurts he said he was gonna stay. I loved loving him and wanted to do it for as long as I can.\n\n I\u2019ve been an absolute fucking mess all day. I\u2019ve been crying since 7am. It hurts beyond belief and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had such a pure love for someone before. I don\u2019t know how to approach this situation.

My thinking is that I don't exactly have the authority to tell my GF what she can and can't do, and I want her to get the most out of her European experience. Plus, it'd be safer and more fun for her if she traveled with a male friend. She's talked about the friend in question to me quite a bit before and so I know who he is as well.\n\nNot to mention that from my experience if people are going to cheat, they're going to cheat no matter what... Plus, my GF hasn't given me any reason not to trust her for 4 years, which isn't exactly a short amount of time.\n\nI brought this up recently to my other friends and coworkers here and they immediately thought it was super weird and kept saying that we're \"just pen pals.\" I didn't think much of it but I'm just wondering if my thinking and decision really is that weird? Just wanted to get some second opinions.\n\n**TL;DR I'm letting my long distance GF go on a trip with another male friend of hers and have received much judgment and am just wondering if this really is that big of a deal.**", "title": "Is it really weird that I'm okay with my long distance GF go on a trip with another one of her male friends?"}, {"created_utc": 1623129573, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nux466/going_from_a_friend_with_benefits_19m_to_her_19f/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "\n\nWe were in the same Econ class this year.

She figured me out but texted anyway. I asked her if she wanted to smoke and she said no because she didn\u2019t know me like that. We ended up getting pizza on my dining card and sitting in the student center watching Blackish. \n\nWe eventually moved to hanging out in the lounge of my dorm and I guess when she figured out I wasn\u2019t a creep she came up to my room. A couple of weeks later, we were friends that kissed sometimes and our entire 2nd semester was just sex. We finally smoked together (she showed up at my room drunk) and she\u2019s silly af when she\u2019s high. She told me she didn\u2019t think she was gonna be as good a scientist or smart as her brother.

Eventually I realized I remained in denial of my emotions for him since my last relationship left me traumatized.  I felt really bad for making it difficult for him since I hadn\u2019t healed so I told him I needed time to get better. So I ended things. \n\nOver those three weeks, I cried almost everyday. I did everything I could to better my mental health, to heal. I regretted taking his love for granted and wished so badly to have him back. I magically wanted a relationship with him after thinking I could never commit myself to someone like that again.\n\n\nOne night he asked me if I wanted to come over and it was like we never ended things. I was so damn happy to be in his presence again. Then school ended and we went home. He confessed he felt as if we were in a relationship and he didn\u2019t know if he was ready. He thought he couldn\u2019t give me what I deserved since he didn\u2019t know what was right for him. (I trust him when he says that so I don\u2019t really think this was an excuse). It hurt terribly.  \n\nFew weeks later, we talk and I end up going to visit him an hour out from me assuming it was friendly terms. We spent the day in the city together and he decided he still wanted me around, but not relationship terms. We still talked regularly, had sex, and showed affection, but acknowledged we can\u2019t be fully committed. It still felt like we were dating anyways. My attachment and love for him grew. I spent every moment with him holding onto every glance I could get. I just knew it might end soon. It kinda fucked me up since those glances are all that replay in my head. \n\n\nA few days ago he promised he wouldn\u2019t leave in a few weeks cus of a change of heart. I still decided not to make any future plans or make any statements referring to a future together. Farthest I would go is a week in advanced. I was supposed to sleepover today and he cancelled on me. Well, surprise! He broke up with me today. He said that he gets too wrapped up into me when we\u2019re together where he doesn\u2019t commit his time to anything else. He said he ends up feeling fulfilled with his day that he doesn\u2019t feel the need to work on any other part of his life. He doesn\u2019t like when that happens and he hates when he gets invested in that way. Then, he said he knew he would hate himself in two days for ending things. So, I gave him a few more days to contemplate and decide with full confidence that\u2019s what he wants to do. \n\nHe said the days I\u2019ve spent with him recently have been the best days he\u2019s had and expressed how much admiration he has for me. It\u2019s been so conflicting to be told you\u2019re loved yet you\u2019re still be left behind. I understand his reasons fully, but it just hurts he\u2019s leaving again. It hurts he said he was gonna stay. I loved loving him and wanted to do it for as long as I can.\n\n I\u2019ve been an absolute fucking mess all day. I\u2019ve been crying since 7am. It hurts beyond belief and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had such a pure love for someone before. I don\u2019t know how to approach this situation. I want to be in his life and I want him in mine. I want to compromise to help him with his internal conflict. Alongside this, I have no one to talk to. I am goddamn lonely and heartbroken. \n\nThis is probably one of the harder emotional things I\u2019ve had to deal with. What should I do? Should I talk to one of his girl friends I became friends with and ask her what to do? How do I approach this while minimizing my pain as much as possible? I assume that he\u2019s going to decide that we can\u2019t be together after these few days I have him. And I know I probably sound dumb for hoping there\u2019s a way to turn that around.

Like go into a random market if I pass one, try a cafe, venture out into the city, etc. My husband on the other hand needs everything to be planned, and if the environment is too dissimilar from what he knows, he'll feel uncomfortable and not have a good time. He's introverted and a homebody, and honestly I don't think travelling is his thing despite what he says. He gets tired out in new environments and starts to shut down. I use to use blame words like \"complain\" or \"unwilling\" to try new things, but I'm starting to see that he just has different feelings and standards when it comes to travelling and it's not inherently a bad thing. It's just not what I find enjoyable. We went on a day trip to a midwestern city (400,000 in population, so not huge huge) and he had a terrible time even when things were planned out. A new stressor was made if things didn't go as planned  (i.e. taking a long time to find parking).\n\nI want to see the world, and I plan on it.

Mom has always been open with us about the guys she's talking to or dating since the divorce with the first student/husband, so I find it interesting that she hadn't mentioned this new guy. I assume it's because she feels ashamed to be dating another student. I'm back and forth on how I feel about this. They're all consenting, willing adults, but I think there's an odd dynamic considering the initial teacher/student relationship...even if it was years ago.

Going to be a long post, sadly I don't have many friends to seek advice from. Thanks for reading in advance. \n\nMe(f24) and my bf(m30) have been dating for 7 months. Our relationship was good in the beginning but it's been rocky since about a month or two ago. He says we're compatible because we're both career driven and independent, focused on work and building long term projects/business. I agree on that but other parts of our lifestyle we're not, ex) he likes to party - I think he may be a little immature for his age but then who knows - checks out hot girls, etc. I hate drinking and we had a fight where he was unhappy that most of the night outs I get tired easily and have to recharge my social energy while he wants to keep going and drink until 3 in the morning or something. We almost always end with a fight if we go out with his friends because they're all single, want to go clubbing and bars while I would rather stay home and cuddle with my bf but he wants to join them.\n\nI have major trust issues and I have it with him also. I caught him texting his ex, having a photo folder dedicated to her and looking at them once in a while, dm'ing her, etc. Sometimes I found this through snooping and he would put the blame on me and we would end the case with me being the problem. The worst thing is, I think I have an unhealthy codependency problem with him where I live through him. I don't necessarily have the best social life but he has a lot of friends so I meet people through him. I go to events because I'm his gf and was invited, etc. \n\nAnyway fast forward today, we unfortunately moved in together last week with his friend- too fast but we thought it made sense financially. And I was trying to be cute making breakfast for him while he was taking a while in the bathroom. He ate, left to work, I went on to his computer to his IG. I can't seem to stop snooping because I don't feel loved and trust. I always feel like second choice from his ex because they couldn't work out of long distance. He used to always tell his friends before he met me that he will end up marrying her but that she's indecisive and far. Anyway, I snooped to his IG and his recent search was some other ex-fling. She now has a bf and he once told his friend when we started dating that too bad she has a bf because she was his exact type. \n\nI felt so sick knowing that while I was cooking breakfast for him, he was in the toilet looking through some ex-fling's IG profile. He came out, told me he loved me and left to work. Our i love you's don't even mean much now it seems. Yet he says next week he's visiting his parents and that he wants me to come with. I am confused and broken. My anxiety has never been this bad and I honestly just want it to be nice but maybe I'm not enough for him and he's not the right one for me. I constantly compare myself to his ex or somehow have to prove my worth to him so he stays.. that's how I feel. But once we were arguing and the topic of breakup came up and he asked me if my life would get better if he was gone and I thought about it and no. I would have to go back to my parents and I cannot stand living with them. I don't know what to do or feel. Last night apparently I screamed in my dream and he had to wake me up but all I remember was me screaming at him in my dream asking why he would still text and think about his ex. God. \n\nBreak up seems to be the right thing to do. I feel too weak and sick and don't know if I can do it or I'll be okay after.

Since always, I\u2019ve had a personality where I don\u2019t tolerate bullshit and toxicity in friendships. That doesn\u2019t mean I stopped being friends at the drop of a hat, but when someone showed one or two red flags, i gradually distanced myself. And I would do it again, it\u2019s just my personal choice. Naturally I didn\u2019t \u201caccumulate\u201d friends throughout my life. Like so many people I know, they have \u201cchildhood\u201d friends, then a high school group, then college friends, then mutual friends of these friends. But I always had a select handful. At this point, I have literally just one friend from college and one or two friends from school. Which would be completely okay had my relationships with them been great, but I always feel like I\u2019m the one who cares more and reaches out more. At this point I don't actually even talk to anyone anymore, let alone feeling understood or cared about. And at first I was like it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just who I am as a person, I care more and I don\u2019t have ego problems so I can reach out first. But then I couldn\u2019t keep doing it. Because it legit made me feel like shit after a while, like a loser. And yes, I did communicate with my \u201cbest friend\u201d from college about this issue of me reaching out more- she says she legit hates texting people and calling. Though she also cries to me sometimes about having nobody lol. I don\u2019t mind reaching out to her first, but I just told her I feel like I\u2019m not cared about by her. And I don\u2019t doubt her problems, I know there are a lot of people who get overwhelmed with it. It\u2019s completely okay, I don\u2019t expect it from them. I just feel sad that I don\u2019t have any other friends.\n\nAt this point, when I see my old friends who maintained their group of people, I feel like they look happier. I know everything is rosy on social media but I know that some of them are genuinely happy with stable friendships. I have reached out to my old friends (not the toxic ones, just the ones who I faded out with). They are sweet but honestly it was clear that they do not want us to be back to being friends like the old times now, and are happy with current/new set of friends. \n\nBecause this has been going around since 2-3 years at least now, my self esteem has definitely taken a bit. I\u2019m very secure and honest about my situation but deep down I do wonder what the fuck is wrong with me? Legit having irl friends and feeling cared about would make me so happy.

(I\u2019m still breastfeeding him so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s doing 100%). He enjoy the first 6 days of vacay at his state to go get a haircut, watch his movies, and play video games. Even then, after just 3 days of taking care of the baby, he wants out. \n\nOur baby was a planned child. I specifically did this so that I don\u2019t have to be stressed during pregnancy since I knew he was going to take out all the work venting on me. My mother and I do 95% of the work - breastfeeding, sanitizing, food, washing dishes, laundry. His job? It was supposed to be putting the baby to sleep.

He said \u201cOh, that\u2019s (pregnancy is) done, then.\u201d Like it was nothing!\n\nWhen he moved away, we had an argument about drinking and driving. This was after his sister had two DWI\u2019s. So I told him to be careful and promise not to drink more than 2 drinks (at first it was 1 drink). I asked him to not jeopardize his career and he wanted to drink as much as he wanted and decide for himself. After that argument, he didn\u2019t care to call me for 1 month.

I thought this was her way of rejecting me. \n\nI told her i understood and I wouldn\u2019t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn\u2019t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn\u2019t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. \n\nDidn\u2019t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn\u2019t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her\n\nI texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. \n\nShe told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. \n\nIt was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn\u2019t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response\n\nShe seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn\u2019t just tell me she wasn\u2019t interested. \n\nI went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn\u2019t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague\n\nTl;dr: met this girl a while ago.

I can\u2019t even count how many times we\u2019ve said to each other we\u2019re not going to cheat on one another, though she probably has anxiety about this too, since I cheated in a previous relationship (*not* this relationship).

People I thought I could trust have stabbed me in the back \u2013 long story-short, my buddy (31M) started talking my girlfriend on IG, some of the things they talked about made me a bit uncomfortable (e.g.: what they\u2019re into, sexually). My girlfriend was open and honest and told me about it every step of the way. From what I heard (my buddy\u2019s drunken \u201capology\u201d, my buddy and his fianc\u00e9e (30F) have a \u201cvery liberal\u201d relationship \u2013 they\u2019ve talked about other couples (swinging), and was seeing if my girlfriend was \u2018interested\u2019 (I guess?). My buddy, on the other hand, kept most of the conversation from his fianc\u00e9e. It was only when she read the messages, and confronted, did my buddy admit he had (probably still has) feelings for my girlfriend. My girlfriend has repeatedly told me she does not find him attractive. It\u2019s obvious he was having an emotional affair, but my girlfriend doesn\u2019t think she did on her part, because she saw it as \u2018just talking to a friend\u2019 \u2013 she wasn\u2019t as emotionally involved as he is. We have pretty much smoothed things over with my buddy and his fianc\u00e9e, but I think I\u2019m always going to have my guard up with him now \u2013 \u2018forgive, but don\u2019t forget\u2019. My girlfriend knows it\u2019s still a sore spot with me. Right now, the three of them (my girlfriend, my buddy, and his fianc\u00e9e) are camping \u2013 I had to work so I\u2019m going up later. I know I trust her, but I have this knot in the pit of my stomach that she\u2019s cheating. I know I have a lot of work to do on myself. I\u2019m just wondering if these feelings are unfounded or if I should be worried.\n\nTL/DR; Whenever my girlfriend takes a while to respond, my immediate gut feeling goes to \u201ccheating\u201d.

I want to preface this with she's amazing in every way. Extremely kind, compassionate, cares about me, and supports me through almost anything. I'm not looking to break up or anything dramatic, I'm just looking for help with communicating on this issue. I've recently proposed but I don't want to move forward with getting married until we've ironed this out. \n\nWe met in college and have since graduated and moved to a new city together to start our professional lives. She's a student purusing a masters, and started working a research job for her university. Her work...sucks to say the least. Communication issues with her bosses/advisors, it's unfulfilling busy work and the list goes on. She started this just about 2-3 months ago and ever since she started it's been a huge drag on her. She never worked in college/high school and this is her first \"real\" job. She works remote and I've been recently unemployed due to moving to a new city, but I've worked my entire life from a freshman in high school all the way through college doing some pretty shitty jobs (landscaping, fast food) and I'm actively looking for any job to pay the bills for her school and for us to live.\n\nSince I'm at home she's able to talk to me about how things are going throughout the day. Whenever I ask her how things are going I'm usually met with something dark such as \"this work is pointless and awful, and I'd rather die and have a natural disaster end it all than do this.\" Now, I see the work she does, and I understand that it's not fun to work remote and that there are issues all over the place (it's coding heavy and she's new to it which is frustrating) but I feel like her attitude towards it is a bit over the top. I've had depression/anxiety for as long as I can remember. I'm doing really great with it now, but in the past I've tried to commit suicide and have had debilitating depression for weeks on end. I'm truly happy about my life now, but when we have those conversations I feel a switch go off in my body and I get back to those rough feelings. I know it's a trigger, and I've communicated that before and she recognizes it, but after a couple of days she's back to the same type of complaining. I have an avoidant/dismissive attachment style, and I always try to be there for her when she's having stress but I'm getting to the point where I can't take it anymore. When she does this it can cause me to retreat and it creates a negative feedback loop because she gets upset at how I react to her venting (I usually shut down after enough complaining and stop responding.)\n\nI'm a huge optimist, so I try to tell her once she's been in it for a while things may get better. Or when she goes back to working in person the communication may get ironed out, and once she starts classes she may find purpose with what she's doing but that all instantly gets dismissed for more dark, depressive comments. The upset side of me constantly wants to say \"sometimes work is hard but you just need to buck up and work through it and that's just the way things are. Stop complaining so much you don't know how good you have it. You could be getting your ass kicked working 10 hours a day doing back breaking work but you're getting paid to sit at a computer and write some code with all of the resources you could ever need. Grow up.\" but I've never said that and I never will. After those conversations I usually lose motivation and want to curl up in bed and feel nothing. I know this isn't sustainable and that my emotions are causing me shut down, not hers, but we can't afford therapy at the moment and I've tried to communicate over and over that this type of venting is a trigger for me and it's hard to take every day. I know she's not serious about killing herself, or quitting resulting in us being homeless (just a few of her comments) so it's hard to be level headed with all of the drama.  I always try to be there for her but I can't anymore and it makes me feel like a bad partner. If she just said \"work is really stressing me out, I'm at a roadblock and I don't know what to do and it's extremely frustrating\" I'd be able to empathize with her and it would be easier to listen and be there for her.\n\nI have personal feelings of anxiety (trying to find a job in a new city/country) and depression and it can be hard to communicate those with her when all she talks about is her work and her stresses as well. I guess I'm at a loss and I'm looking for a place to rant/find some ways to communicate better with her. Again I'm not looking to breakup as the easy solution. We've been through a lot together and have grown up so much with each other and we are engaged. Any advice on this is greatly appreciated!

Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn\u2019t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. \n\nThe next day I texted her but got no response\u2026 thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn\u2019t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. \n\nI told her i understood and I wouldn\u2019t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn\u2019t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn\u2019t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. \n\nDidn\u2019t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn\u2019t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her\n\nI texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. \n\nShe told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. \n\nIt was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn\u2019t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response\n\nShe seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn\u2019t just tell me she wasn\u2019t interested. \n\nI went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn\u2019t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague\n\nTl;dr: met this girl a while ago.

Nothing serious at all and never even went on a date or anything. I was never into him more than friends and neither was he to my understanding. Recently he was been more attentive to my Instagram stories and really trying to talk to me/develop a better bond with me. There were several times I\u2019ve left him on read or delivered either because I was busy or just not interested. As we live four hours away from each other, he has invited me to visit him and stay the weekend on numerous occasions but something has always come up for me. Finally, about a month ago he invited me on a fully paid (by his company) trip to Mexico. To say the least, it was an amazing time. He didn\u2019t even try to hook up until I said something and I could tell he was a bit nervous but the sex was great with an amazing connection and we really realized that we are extremely similar in many ways. Both opened up to each other a lot and had an overall great time. Upon flying back to his city, he wanted me to go out with him and introduced me to all of his childhood friends while out and it felt very much like a bf/gf situation because we were visibly together in front of everyone. It was just obvious he has developed feelings for me beyond just friendship over the course of the trip. We even admitted how much we cared about one another before going to bed that night and it felt more like an \u201cI love you\u201d without actually saying the words. I drove 4 hours to go home the next day and texted him once I\u2019ve settled in the following day so we both had some space from each other and a chance to recoup. I didn\u2019t expect much of a response from him but we texted for the next two days and he seemed very eager to answer my texts, even putting in extra effort to heart and like certain messages, which was more than he did before the trip. \n\nOne strange thing I\u2019ve noticed is that he completely stopped watching all of my Instagram stories. He isn\u2019t active on socials at all, but would always keep up with me. Since the trip, he completely stopped. Yesterday he went out with a friend and I sent the last text basically wishing him to have fun and that was it. No response from him since. I\u2019m just worried that if maybe has replying to be out of kindness/politeness or if he\u2019s actually interested in talking to me. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed he felt a bit insecure a few times and when we were out with his friends he quietly made a comment that his friend asked how he got someone as cute as me. I wonder if a bit of insecurity has anything to do with it. We also got into a big of an argument over me not feeling well and him feeling like it was his responsibility and that has trying his best. I feel that he questions himself a lot and is incredibly hard on himself, which I understand because I am the same way. \n\nI wonder what the best approach to this whole situation would be, I just want an outsider\u2019s perspective on all of this.

Met in 4th grade, lived down the street from each other, and even went off to the same college together. I can't help wondering what the heck happened and it hurts to not know \"why\". Sorry if this is long!\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nA little backstory:\n\nIf I had to put my finger on it, we started drifting apart junior year of college. She, her boyfriend (now husband), and I shared an apartment off campus and they decided to get their own place. I was never a big fan of her husband, but she was happy and he treated her well, so I put my differences aside and we got along ok. Not long after they moved out, I saw him pop up in my POF queue and showed her his dating profile which was recently active. In the end, she believed his story that someone stole his pictures and made a fake profile. I was only trying to be a good friend to her. The distance grew and we spoke once every few months, most times I was the one reaching out. Her study partner became her new best friend and I truly was happy for her because I realize we'd grown apart but had nothing but love for her.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nFast forward to the semester of graduation, and she Facetimes me to announce she's engaged. She said I was her oldest friend and wanted me to be one of the first to know. I tell her how happy I am for her and we chat for a while and as far as I know all is good (though we're not as close). We both graduated and got adult jobs and next thing you know we've gone a year without talking.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nI finally reached out to her one day and realized we both ended up in the same small town an hour from college. So I think, great! I'd love to hang out more, and we live 10 mins away it's perfect. Over the next 2-3 months I asked her to hang out, get dinner, do a paint class, when is she free, etc. She was always too busy with wedding planning, etc despite living 10 mins away. I started going to fitness class and ran into her and her new best friend there \"sweating for the wedding\". We all 3 started working out together daily. After a few weeks she asks me if I'll be one of her bridesmaids because someone dropped out and she felt like I deserved to be there, I said yes.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nThe bachelorette party and wedding went fantastic and it felt like we were getting close like we used to be. I reached out after the honeymoon to ask how it went and we talked a bit. I never heard from her since then, and didn't reach out because I simply got tired of putting in all the effort. It was always on me to text first or make plans. And looking back to before the wedding, I felt that I'd put so much effort into rekindling the friendship that wasn't reciprocated unless it was convenient for her, and maybe I was only asked to be a bridesmaid because she needed to fill the spot. She never thanked me for her wedding gift or reached out to ask how I'm doing. We were friends on social media but I unfriended her because it hurt to see the time and effort she put into her other friends. I figured if she really cared to talk she'd reach out and be the bigger friend like I have many times before.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nI have no ill will towards her at all, I loved the time we had together and always wished the best for her! In my mind, what happened is we drifted apart but on good terms. I was very confused when I ran into her husband a few months ago at Walmart, and thinking everything was cool, I waved at him and said hello. He looked right at me and said \"Who are you, I think you're confused I don't know you\". That made me feel terrible but I brushed it off.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nFast forward to today:\n\nMonday I joined a dance fitness class and as I'm warming up, she walks in. She picked the spot directly next to me and we didn't acknowledge each other the entire time. I know she recognized me because she stared at me on her way into the class. I know it's a two way street but given the incident with her husband and the fact that she noticed me first and didn't acknowledge, I thought it best to leave it alone. Now I'm the one \"sweating for the wedding\" and I'll probably run into her every day at the gym and it's awkward. I want to ask if we can talk but she always has her new best friend with her and I'm afraid she'd write me off completely.

I, after all, waited all this time to tell her how I feel, so no biggie. I hang back a little to not pressure her and give her some space to work out whatever, but we continue to communicate. I see this as still a positive thing, and it pays off because she says she wants to talk and get to know me more.  \n\nWell, after telling me she wants to talk and get to know me better, out of nowhere, she tells me she isn't interested. But in that same conversation, she tells me she needs time. Bit of conflict and mixed message, yes?! I tell her if she isn't interested, I will respect her choice, or if she needs time, I can give her that too. It's her choice. As a result, she blocks me, and while that sucked, I figure that it.\n\nA few days later, she (unlocks) messages me, apologizes for being upset, tells me she is not rejecting me, is working through something, needs time, and still wants to get to know me. She even tries to video call me, but it never connects due to a poor connection. So we spend most of the night talking. We do so the following night too.

I have never had to take such difficult math classes like he is so this is sort of a difficult situation for me to understand and deal with in the best way. He is constantly complaining about school and studying and I mean CONSTANTLY. Every single conversation we\u2019ve had over the phone these past months (we are currently long distance) has consisted of him bringing up studying/ complaining and I\u2019m starting to really get annoyed. We\u2019ve been dating for a while now and at first I was very supportive and understanding. I would still consider myself that to this day. I let him know that he is almost done and that everything he\u2019s worked toward is going to pay off in the end, but anything I say is just brushed off. I am the type of girl who\u2019s been raised in a very Hispanic household where I was taught to suck it up and move on unlike him. I\u2019ve learned that when I say things like that, it doesn\u2019t help so I\u2019ve stopped doing that. However, it\u2019s starting to take a really effect me and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me or if it\u2019s him who is in the wrong here. I\u2019ve talked to my siblings and a few friends about this issue in a very non biased manner, and they\u2019ve all agreed that even they see this or notice that his whole life and conversations revolve around school when they\u2019re around him. It\u2019s like he likes to burn himself out. It seems like school has taken up his entire life and that is now his number one priority. In my shoes, I feel like I have been pushed back no matter how hard I\u2019ve supported him. This seems to be a battle that he likes to fight himself and anything I say doesn\u2019t get through to him. He has always been this way, as most of his conversations with anyone revolve around school. I\u2019m starting to get fed up on only talking about school as it\u2019s obviously a tiring and stressful conversation to hear constantly, especially as a student myself. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to just get away from all of that and talk about something else. Of course when we do have conversations that aren\u2019t related to school, it\u2019s amazing. I have a couple of friends who are studying the same major or similar majors and taking pretty much the same classes as him. Ive compared the way they talk about school vs how he acts and it\u2019s in a much more positive manner. He always says things like \u201cjust kill me\u201d in a sarcastic way and he says its a joke but to me it\u2019s not funny. I try to brighten him up but nothing helps. I don\u2019t know what to do because it\u2019s taking a toll on our relationship as I\u2019ve told him that he shouldn\u2019t be looking at school in such a negative way. I completely understand that school sucks and it\u2019s tiring, especially everything that he\u2019s going through, but this type of attitude every single day is exhausting. I\u2019m scared that if he likes to cause this much stress on himself and enjoys burning himself out (and bringing me along with him) he\u2019s going to continue doing this once he\u2019s in the workforce and it\u2019ll effect me past graduation.

I was truly very immature then but he put up with it a lot and eventually we both decided to get into a serious relationship. Since then, we\u2019ve had some ups and downs, but he has been the best boyfriend one could ever ask for. He is very caring, loving, affectionate, and a sweet person, overall. He always tells me how much he loves me and that I am his most favorite person every time we are together and I can truly hear the passion in his voice when he tells me those things. My ex cheated on me and I had a lot of trust issues with my partner since then, but this guy has helped me work on them and I\u2019ve never had a reason to believe he lied or cheated on me, until visited him last weekend. \n\nMy bf lives a few states away, as he had to move there for work about a few months into our relationship 3 years ago. Since then, he has been coming down to see me about once a month and I go visit him occasionally. Last weekend when I went to see him, I was standing behind him while he was sitting on his chair and using his laptop and he accidentally clicked on WhatsApp. I saw that there were two girls he was texting which I never knew about. I held it in the whole week, but today I decided to ask him \u201cDo you have any friends who are girls?\u201d And he avoided the question two times and finally responded by saying \u201cno\u201d over text, as I didn\u2019t stop asking. I decided to call him and I asked him again over the phone and he said \u201cyes, ofcourse I have friends who are girls\u201d and I asked him \u201cwho are they?\u201d And he tells me their names, but he didn\u2019t tell me the names of the girls I saw on his WhatsApp. I proceeded to asked him if he was being completely honest with me right now and he kept saying yes. I told him \u201cI am sorry for being blunt, but I know what I am talking about\u201d. He then started asking me what I knew and what I was referring to. I finally said \u201cyou get what you give\u201d and I believe he took it the wrong way and he got very upset and started saying \u201cwhat the fuck? Do you think I\u2019m cheating on you?\u201d He was very upset and continued asking me what I found and I started crying and asked him who Liz (the name of the girl I saw on WhatsApp) was. He completely denied talking to a girl named Liz and he kept asking me who she was and where I got the name from and he blatantly lied. I hung up saying \u201cbye\u201d because I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. \n\nThat Saturday, while I saw his WhatsApp, I was drunk so there is a chance that I got the name wrong.  \n\nI gave myself a few minutes to calm down and I texted him on WhatsApp and I told him exactly how on Saturday I saw the names of the two girls on his WhatsApp. I tried calling him after that twice but he didn\u2019t pick up and I don\u2019t know what to do. I really want to give him the benefit of the doubt, as he is a great person and has never given me a reason to suspect him before.

And now that we are back together, we are moving to San Diego to be together in one month.

He already has a job lined up and I am in the process of getting my stuff figured out. For now we are working, saving, FaceTiming daily. It\u2019s going well.\n\nThe only caveat I have right now is how he won\u2019t tell anyone (from where we used to live) about us yet. My concerns began when I guess I felt outcasted when I still lived in his city once we broke up and how he doesn\u2019t seem willing to correct the mess he kind of made. What I mean by that is when we broke up he honestly talked a lot of shit about me to his friends to the point where I was honestly pretty outcasted everywhere I went and became extremely depressed before I moved. For example, his friend tried to fight me at the bar, I got harassed at a public beach and told to leave on the 4th of July. It was messy. And honestly I\u2019m still working through this hurt. But like I said things have been going well. \n\nI bring all this up because his friends really love him and don\u2019t think I\u2019m good for him. But these people really mistreated me because of the things he said and isn\u2019t willing to backtrack on any of it. Therefore he isn\u2019t willing to tell them that we are back together and moving in less than 30 days. He wants to Irish goodbye everyone and just treat me like his secret girlfriend until then. \n\nI have already told my friends and family about us reconnecting, obviously not an easy conversation because they also have had to deal with the toxicity that was the past. I guess it just really upsets me that he isn\u2019t willing to make this public yet no matter how much I communicate its importance to me. And yea part of it does have to do with how everything went down before I left. He caused this in a way and can\u2019t see it and it\u2019s really bothering me.\n\nHis argument is that he doesn\u2019t want to lose his friends and wants to make his last few weeks as smooth as possible before he leaves, but I just keep coming back to the fact that it\u2019s not cool to keep someone you love a secret for any reason.

The relationship was mostly smooth sailing - very compatible personalities, good sex, good friends, mutual effort, strong communication. The most recurring issue, which arose about 8 months in, was about sexuality.\n\nWe met as lesbians but she later realized she missed/enjoyed sex with men, specially oral sex. This triggered a lot of anxiety in me bc my first relationship many years ago ended similarly. She also later learned that she\u2019s more inclined to non monogamy. We didn\u2019t discuss these often but we\u2019d always butt heads bc I was always speaking from s place of anxiety, insecurity and abandonment fears. Nonetheless we worked around it. She doesn\u2019t use labels now, and eventually I came out as pansexual. I have also been gradually unpacking my fears about sex with men and being more open about my curiosities. \n\nWe broke up around mid June because she was having difficulty finding a couple to be a unicorn for (our compromise, after a lot of talk) and decided to just shift her focus to single men. Which, again, caused a huge freak out on my end. We eventually decided to start dating from scratch non exclusively, and still saw each other pretty regularly for social events since we share a lot of friends.  (Trying to keep my insecurity at bay I said I wouldn\u2019t want to hear about her hookups, but she\u2019s very into that kinda thing so she wanted to hear mine.)\nSometimes she would get drunk and flirt with guys or dance on them, and with everything being so fresh (and usually drunk) I immediately would get jealous. I didn\u2019t make a scene but almost always discussed it the day after. We had a convo like this before a date last Sunday, but after thinking about it I realized how out of line I was and apologized for being insecure/possessive, especially since she was technically single. \n\nFast forward to yesterday. Her sister had a cookout/party and roughly the whole friend group, plus some new people our age; we\u2019re all having fun and getting drunk. Ex looked amazing but I couldn\u2019t really flirt because her family is super homophobic. But in the meantime I was chatting with this new guy (21m) and we were vibing. I didn\u2019t really have any intentions going in but I got more flirty the drunker I was.\n\nTowards the end of the night, around 1 am, the group comes in from smoking and I\u2019ve made the executive decision that I want alone time with this man. I had briefly lost my phone bu told the group to give me an hour before I take people home, \nand we dipped to mess around in his car. Unbeknownst to me, my ex had been looking all over for me. She found us making out in his car, and then later in more sexual positions (she came out 3x).when I found my phone I found out she was furious, thought I was hypocritical and (from today\u2019s convo) feels hurt and betrayed beyond words that I didn\u2019t tell her. In my defense, I had zero idea that 1, I needed to tell her beforehand, 2, that she would be this pissed that I didn\u2019t. I told our close mutual friend (23f) about it in the morning Bc I was eager to tell SOMEbody and I needed to resolve the ex argument before diving into the story. But that clearly backfired, as the friend then went and told my ex, which made her even more mad!!! \n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m fucked, our trust is gone, she barely wants to speak with me let alone date again. As the person at fault I have no idea how to even begin moving on.

I told her that I felt that after I voiced my concernes about that guy nothing changed, that I felt disconnected and even that there was someone else I might be interested in. Turned out the other girl was interested as well and we started dating. My now Ex-GF seemed to notice that she lost something and tried to get me back, even moved to my city (I never asked for that). I was hesitant, because a part of me still loved her, but when she told me that she was texting this guy way more than I thought I knew that she was not the right one for me. So I kept dating the other girl, who has become my GF in the meantime. My Ex asked me to stay friends after a while and since all of our friends were mutual friends I tried to make it work. She texted me now and then, but I just replied to her and never started a conversation myself.\n\nNow, a few days ago I found out that she is casually seeing this other guy now. She told me she knows that it won't be something serious because they want different things in life. Somehow I felt disgusted. I kept questioning myself for the last months if it was fair to her to break up, since nothing physical or anything happened between them while I got to know someone else and left, but this gave me the feeling that I was right all along about what she's been doing and that it probably just didn't went further because she knew it wouldn't work out with the other guy for a longer time. Still, the feeling that it happened to me again that my GF got interested in someone else while we were dating hurt me and I told her I don't want to stay in contact any longer and deleted her everywhere.\n\nA friend told me that she's acting now like I am a hypocrite, because I left her for someone else and now that she's \"moving on\" as well I cut contact with her. So my question is: Am I that hypocrite? Should I have done something differently?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: GF neglected me for another guy, I broke it off to be with someone else but we stayed friends, she started sleeping with that guy and I cut contact because of that.

I want to go see him, but I just turned 18 and have strict parents so I can't do that yet for a few years, though if he went to go see me I could get away from my parents and tell them I'm going on vacation. He says he wants to go see me, but recently I've been thinking that maybe he doesn't. He's very overweight and he's said from the start of our relationship that he wants to lose weight and improve himself before he goes to see me and that he won't before he's ready, which I completely understand and respect. \n\nThe problem is that he's been putting in almost no effort to lose weight or change himself (I know this because I've known him for 4 years now and all he does every day is sit at his PC and play games even though he says he wants to go outside and camp he never does it even though he has all the time in the world to go do it as he has no job or responsibilities taking away his time.) It's giving me a big doubtful feeling because I feel like I might be waiting for nothing. In early January this year he told me he wanted to go to the gym in the summer and go swim a lot and go outside a lot. He's only gone outside 3 days of the 4 months this summer has been.  \n\n\nA few weeks ago, I told him very clearly that I don't want to wait another 2 years for him to start with his process if all he does is complain about it now but does nothing to change it. He has ENOUGH time on his hands and he could definitely do with getting up for even 30 minutes in his day and exercising, and eating better. I've told him this multiple times, he says it's hard to do that. I tell him often that I'm willing to wait, but not for another 2,3,4,5 years because I just don't want to dedicate myself to something that isn't going to go anywhere and keeps existing only because of empty promises. I wanted to see him put in actual effort to improve on himself so he becomes happier with himself and gets to the point he's ready to meet up, but that just hasn't happened.\n\nI know I'm complaining a LOT but since I can't tell everyone here about my entire relationship I have to mention that I was the one constantly telling him to go exercise and go outside and maybe join his dad in grocery shopping every once in a while and wash his face in the morning and take showers and brush his teeth. It feels like I have to take care of him to great extents and it really sucks seeing that he's putting in no effort himself.   \n\n\nSeeing the time he has and the time he could put into improving himself and the absolutely no time he puts into exercise frustrates me incredibly. About 3 months into our relationship, he bought an exercise bike and used that for about 2 months and ONLY if I told him to use it (otherwise he just wouldn't try) and after he hurt his back doing squats with me because I was trying to get him to exercise he's never been on the bike since. \n\nI've done so much to motivate him and I told him he could use a therapist or a life coach, but he doesn't want to take my advice on that because of his experiences when he was younger.   \n\n\nOf course I don't want to leave him, he's very good for me and makes me incredibly happy, it's just the incredible uncertainty of him not showing any effort into wanting to change himself to go see me, that's making me doubtful if the relationship is meant to last. I want it to last so bad, but I'm at a point where I'm so uncertain about our future I don't know how to feel anymore.  \n\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend said he'd start losing weight at the beginning of our relationship so he could go see me, it's been 1 year and 4 months and I'm starting to grow doubtful because he is putting in no effort to exercise and the feeling that he wants to go see me is fading away even though he tells me he does.

We regularly interact with people from other departments coming down to get supplies, and of these regulars there's one girl I always thought was pretty cute. I never bothered to try to flirt or anything, since I always just assume I'm not anybodies type. But yesterday I was burning away on Tinder when I happened to come across her profile. I was hopeful but cautious, because as we all know, even Super Liking doesn't guarantee anything, and plus, it might be an old account she wasn't using anymore, so she might not be single. So using the creeper powers of Google-fu I ended up hitting her Facebook page, and I found that not only is she single, she also enjoys some of the same games and shows I do. At this point, I knew I had to ask her out. \n\nThe problem comes from the fact that I've never asked a girl out before, and a lot of guides online are either written for highschoolers or PUAs. The social dynamics here don't really feel like they match any of the guides for highschoolers, and since I'm not just trying to get laid, I don't really think the PUAs tactics are going to be helpful. So I'm in totally uncharted territory here. My first thought was to go with an ultra-direct approach: the next time she comes to the department, I would say \"Hey, I saw you're on Tinder. If you're still single, we should go get drinks/coffee/whatever/etc\" as she's heading back out. My friends thought I probably didn't need to mention Tinder, so I thought about just replacing that part with \"Hey, I think you're pretty cute.\" Even still someone suggested I should contact her on Facebook since I have that link already, but I thought that might be weird, since I never really go out of my way to contact someone online I don't know like that. It was also suggested that I try to talk to her and get to know her more before I ask her out, but I feel like in this situation I should make my intentions in talking to her more clear right off the bat. Maybe that's untactful of me, and I'm willing to hear you guys out on why the long game might be better, but I'd rather just ask her out right away. But basically, there's a lot of angles to go about this.\n\nI just need some (probably simple) advice on how to ask this girl out without making it difficult for her.

Please, don't judge me for worrying. I may be overreacting, I don't know, but I'd like some kind opinions.\n\nIt started a few weeks ago. Apparently, a random girl added my fiance on snap &amp; he added her back. The next day he messaged her first &amp; asked her who she was. She gave him her first name &amp; he said alright. She then went on to explain why she added him &amp; asked him if he's from her area. My fiance asked what area &amp; she told him where she's from, which is about half an hour from where we are. He then told her where he's from &amp; she didn't reply. Later that day my fiance left to buy me food before I went to work. On his way out he took a picture of his car &amp; sent it to her. That sounds pretty innocuous, but the reason it surprised me is because my fiance made it a point not to show off his car to anyone but his friends &amp; family. He drives a sports car &amp; when he first bought it I told him he should post it to show it off but he said he wouldn't because \"girls will start hitting me up because they like my car\". He's never taken a picture of the car or posted it anywhere. So why he showed it off to a random girl.. surprised me. She replied back saying she loved his car &amp; asked questions about it then asked if he liked car meetups. He said no it wasn't his thing. Then she asked what he was up to &amp; he said he was getting food then going back to his place. They talked a little more from what I know but I can't remember what all was said. Then after that he blocked her &amp; took her off because he thought she was suspicious for some reson.\n\nThe way I know this happened is because while they were texting my fiance reached out to his friend who regularly visits the town the girl is from. His friend didn't recognize her so that's why my fiance removed her. His friend's girlfriend read the messages &amp; told me later that night. I didn't bring it up to my fiance because I wanted to know if he'd mention it. 2 days later he told me. His story matches up but he didn't mention showing her his car. I asked what they talked about &amp; he said she told him where she was from, &amp; asked what he was up to &amp; that he told her he was getting food for his girl &amp; she responded with \"cool\" &amp; then he blocked her.\n\nI didn't tell him his friend's GF told me.

They're video/open-source thingies. There's also a partition manager on there that isn't on my own computer. Are any of these red flags? Are there others I should recognize as red flags? H was a late bloomer and used to have something of an adult ent \"addiction\" (his label, not mine) and his behavior lately just makes me wonder. I'm also curious about an EA. \n\n\\-- Backstory if you care:\n\nI am not at all the type to worry about cheating, so this feels an odd post (on a throwaway account, of course). I am certain my H isn't physically cheating. He's got too much social anxiety and is around the house way too much to pull that off. But I think at this point I'd be an idiot not to wonder about an EA because of the past year of problems we've had. Long story short, there's this recurring conflict in the house. We have a kid (7yo) and about a year ago, the H started coming to bed late. Like, real late. Every night. Early on, we'd go to bed together, but he always skewed a bit later than I can -- I need more sleep to properly function than he does -- so finally, after being guilted with \"you're going to bed already?\" he accepted that we're going to have different bedtimes unless he comes to bed around 11 or 12. That was fine for a long while but then he started coming to bed at 2a and 3a, sometimes 4a. This wouldn't be a huge deal if he were still functioning the rest of the day, but he's not. Sometimes he tries to wake up long enough to help get the kiddo off to school, but not always. Either way, he'd come back and sleep until 11, noon, 1p. He has a flexible job but it's still FT so after he wakes up, he works. Usually works until 6 or 7, sometimes 7:30, leaving a few minutes to hang with the kiddo before bed. (I should mention I'm the primary breadwinner and have two demanding jobs. All the respect to SAHMs but this isn't that kind of setup.)\n\nWhat this means is that much of the household running falls on me. I can't trust he'll be up for breakfast, I'm the one who runs the pets to the vet and arranges handymen to fix things. He does some stuff around the house like taking out the trash weekly and he's much more on top of unloading the dishwasher -- and he complains mightily that I don't do it enough, though truth is, I tend to do cleaning and stuff on weekends. At the end of a work day, I'm usually spent and I want that time for my kid, not unloading dishes. Regardless, I do things he's requested out of respect -- loading the dishwasher the way he prefers, not leaving stuff out, etc. \n\nI should mention, too, that I do most of the kid-rearing because he loses his temper and can't handle normal kid things (making stupid noises, asking a million questions, leaving messes behind that you have to insist they clean up, etc.). Our kid was having outbursts in school up until I gently asked the H to step back from disciplining because he was escalating issues. He'd scream, laugh vindictively, basically just act like a bully. I kid you not, the child's behavior has completely 180'd since then. Everyone has noticed. I don't remember the last time the kiddo had a tantrum he couldn't reel in. So I already feel like a single parent -- granted, it was my request because the house was just so tense when he was more involved, but I won't pretend that it isn't hard having reliable backup.\n\nI know the house runs fine without him because he just got back from being gone for two months. (It was a work thing. Could he have connected with someone? Sure, but I don't think so. He's got social anxiety to such a level that I think it'd make physically cheating very unlikely.) My chore list grew very slightly, but I fought with no one. My son never had a tantrum. He treats me with respect. I get firm with him plenty but he \\*cares\\* about disappointing me. I treat him with respect, too. And we're great playmates. \n\nFor months and months now I've taken different approaches to asking H to adjust his sleep schedule to something approaching normal. I very gently explained that there are trickle-down effects to it. He's crankier, he doesn't have as much time for his kid, he's always saying that he's run out of time to finish work things, etc. I've been matter-of-fact about it, I've been concerned on a health-level about it, I've poked fun at it, I've cried about it, I've screamed about it. I'm up right now because he woke me up climbing into bed at 3:30 again. This is two days after he assured me he'd work on it and last night it was 4a.\n\nWhat does he do all night? No idea. He says he watches movies and screws around on the computer. Early on I might've been the jealous type -- I'd been the AP when I was an idiot 20something some 15 years ago and learned the hard way how some spouses lie and create woe-is-me stories to woo dum-dums -- but I'm not that girl anymore. I wouldn't be crushed. I would be mad because of the disrespect and the lying. But honestly, my life is good and I'm financially OK enough to endure a not-totally-nasty divorce. Like, I want him to be happy. I'm totally willing to work on doing my part to help make him happy in this relationship, and we have done months of couples therapy to that end, but I can't take a single complaint of his seriously right now when he won't address this huge, nagging, easily fixable problem. I refrain from putting dishes in the sink because it upsets him; why can't he go to bed a couple hours earlier to avoid upsetting me? It's this \\*thing\\* that's become hugely symbolic. He even told me this week that if he's being honest, he thinks a part of his inability to change patterns is \"out of defiance.\" He said I tell him when to sleep, I tell him when to wake up, I tell him what to do too much. Well, I'm running a house and sometimes I do dole out assignments because I've got other stuff to do and get tired of doing all of it solo.\n\nI gotta say, too, for those wondering why we don't just split: He insists he doesn't want to, he cries and has panic attacks when I've asked about it, and, in fact, he told me that the threat of divorce was the \\*cause\\* of his behavior and so I vowed that it was off the table in hopes of that calming him or whatever. Nothing has changed. When we discuss issues, he says that I'm half to blame, I'm blaming everything on him, I'm not doing my part. He says things aren't \"fair\" in the relationship and that he doesn't feel heard. He sounds utterly miserable and yet insists he doesn't want to separate.\n\nI didn't mean for this to go on this long. If you're reading, sorry for the vent. I apparently needed it.

I think he is a nice guy but we  only really scratch the surface of things when we talk. He is very  insecure and anxious. Most of the things he does is to please others,  when he knows it is expected of him. \n\n  \nHe has a good  college degree in IT and works for a horrible company. Pay is horrible,  hours are horrible, atmosphere is not good \u2013 he knows that. I hate that  he lets himself be treated that way. I know he could have it so much  better and he deserves better, but he stays there. Two years ago (at  that time I did not know him yet) he found a new company and they  offered him a position. Long story short: when he tried to quit his boss  told him he cannot do that, the company depends on him and it would be a  dick move if he left. They upped his pay a little and he actually  really let himself be guilt-tripped into staying. I constantly tell him  to look for a new company, update his CV, but I feel he is very anxious  to do that and prefers to bitch about the current company than invest  the energy to start somewhere new. Also, for him a valid justification  for not quitting is that he dreads the conversation with his boss. Which  I think is wrong. So contrary to that I am a driven person. I have a  good job with good pay, and I am eager to get into management and have a  good career. He was a little horrified when I told him recently that I  want to change my current department to a department where I get the  option of supervising. He said how this would be a nightmare for him and  how I would then only live for the company. Mind you, he also works  long hours and works on his annual leave.\n\n  \nAnother  thing that bugs me is that he is not a good judge of character. There  are two friends of his that I don\u2019t like. I feel they only use him and  he even tells me they are annoying. For instance one really likes to  talk to him for hours and he sets up meetings with him. He tells me  beforehand how this friend is so annoying and he does not want to talk  to him for so long but he cannot get rid of him. I tell him: OK, so say  you don\u2019t want to. He says: no, I cannot do that, I just don\u2019t listen to  him then, he only wants to hear himself talk. I don\u2019t understand how he  stays friends with him. And I also suspect he feels about me the same  way, when I talk. I mean I do talk a lot and I know sometimes he does  not listen to me. But he does not tell me when he is bored, he just acts  as if he listens to me. So I get the feeling that he thinks about me  similarly to that friend.\n\n  \nWhen I am annoyed with  him about something, I tell him, but I feel it goes nowhere. I tell him  he should not let himself be used by his company, by his so-called  friends. But he usually says it is not that bad and he can handle it. So  what do I do? I text my best friend. So whenever he works until 10PM I  write to her and tell her he works long hours again and probably does  not get paid accordingly and that that bugs me. When his friend asks him  to help paint the fence or whatever and he needs him, I tell him \u201cOK  but what has he ever done for you\u201d. He says he does not mind. SO then I  text my friend again that this annoys me and that he just does not have a  backbone.   \nSo fast forward to this week. There was  a long project and he worked long hour again. I don\u2019t even tell him  anymore that I think it is not good for his health. I write to my  friend. I tell her he bugs me, and I told her he should really grow a  backbone. I was not nice. She then said I should really think about this  relationship and if I think it is healthy. I wrote I am not sure and it  is so complicated.   \nI feel like he is glad that he  can finally go to places with a girlfriend and his nice friends told me  numerous times that they feel I am so good for him and that he is lucky  to have me. I feel bad when they say that because I am not really  happy, but then I think I want to help him be a confident person because  I do like him. Anyway, I had my laptop open and gave it to him stupidly  and he most probably read a good deal of the horrible things me and my  friend wrote about him. He did not say anything, neither did I because I  didn\u2019t know what to say. \n\n  \nThis is all so bad. I  like him, I don\u2019t know if more can grow of it, but there is so much in  his life I don\u2019t want to put up with. Sometimes I think maybe this is  none of my business, and that I overreact, but it is so hard for me to  tell him that because then I just nag him and he does not listen to me  anyway...   \nI feel this is such a stereotypical  boomer marriage. My parents are exactly like that. My mom constantly  nagging my dad because he does everything anyone expects of him and he  just ignoring her ranting. I don\u2019t want that. But I also don\u2019t know how I  could make all this healthy for us both. He is not a big talker and he  wants people to think he is a reliable person \u2013 regardless of the costs  for him. \n\nAlso, it is probably so unhealthy to want to change him. Am I  too pushy? Should I mind my own business? Can we turn this into a  healthy relationship? What should I do when I need to vent? Am I a  horrible person for bitching about him to my friend? \n\n  \nTL;DR I am not happy with my boyfriend and I don\u2019t think he is happy with me. Are we doomed?

I was friends with this girl some time ago and our companionship was quite good. We have had some conflicts in the past but usually they got resolved soon.\n\nThere had been one such conflict in the past where we both were having some banter, I had made a witty response to her (which wasn't offensive but as I know now, could be misunderstood, but given the context, it could be really understood I didn't mean it the other way around) and she doubled down on insulting me continuously for it, saying that my brain is useless and stuff , and much, much more. Later, she made excuses that she was just trying to be funny and sent emojis stating she is sad. \n\nNow, I totally understand that misunderstandings can cause it but by then, I decided I was going to stand up for myself if she tried to be mad at me without any of my fault there. After all she always saw me as a trustworthy and genuine friend, then who mistreates a genuine friend like this just because you misunderstood something?\n\nAnyways, what happened after a few months was that we were talking again and when she mentioned again and again, that she is doing things without any reason nowdays, I joked on her telling her to go visit this city 'xyz' (say). It's because this city 'xyz' is known for its mental asylum and although it sounds like an offensive joke, I must make it clear that she had cracked similar jokes one me in the past, a lot (e.g. your brain is damaged, go get it checked/repaired ). Also, this joke I cracked is common among friends where I live.\n\nShe couldn't understand it however and I playfully decided to tell her later. By coincidence, she saw a news that people in that 'xyz' city are being treated like object and she immediately concluded that to be the meaning of the joke and texted me, \" If that's what you meant, then it was a very poor sarcasm!! Why will you wanna do that to me???\" And I was confused for a while.\n\nNonetheless, even though I empathized with how it was easy to misunderstand it for her, I was most probably fueled by past incidents where she was always mad at me just because of her misunderstandings, so I stood up for myself and asked, \" Couldn't you have first asked me if I really meant that??\" As I don't wanna make it any longer, a brief summary of what followed was :\n\n1. She agreed she could have been wrong but she says she doesn't care about being right everytime.\n\n2. She didn't even care about how this behavior made me feel becuase if it hurt me, it's not her problem, but mine. \n\n3. She said she is entitled to behave anyway she wants to me. I can't control her and don't have the right to complain.\n\n4. I was trying to basically talk to her politely, but she concluded I am parenting her and said I am only losing my self respect.\n\nAnd, I had to cut her off then from my life, seeing that she isn't willing to be considerate towards me and not willing to talk, as she was trying to quit the convo again and again. \n\nWas it the right thing to do, or was I the one in wrong here somehow? It has always confused me. Please let me know. And thanks for being patient and keen while reading this post.\n\nTl;dr : Had a conflict with a girl who was a great friend, but used to misbehave just because of her misunderstandings. Once she had even got to the point of insulting me too much. So this time, I stood up for myself and tried to talk to her. She said she could have been wrong, but it doesn't matter. She doesnt care about how she treats me because she can't always be right, and that I don't have the right to complain. So, I said goodbye to her.

For most of those years, I have felt unable to imagine life without her. I had a lot of personal issues to deal with in high school and college, never really met the right person during those years, and we just romantically clicked in a way that\u2019s never happened for either of us before.\n\nWe have been there for almost all of the big moments in each other\u2019s adult lives after college. We enjoy many of the same topics, share moral values, and overall enjoy each other\u2019s company. We\u2019ve also worked to build started hobbies together. Mostly outdoors stuff like hiking, camping, and kayaking.\n\nMy girlfriend is also without a doubt the most thoughtful and caring person I have ever met. She cares and provides for her friends, family, and me on a level that is above and beyond really what any human being owes another. This pandemic was incredibly rough: Her father and I both had major surgeries. Back to back, she helped both of us through our recoveries. She was there for me in a way that even my flesh and blood family was not.\n\nWe also place a similar level of importance on our careers and education. She\u2019s emotionally supported my continuing part time education, and I\u2019m supportive of her career in academia. This has been great, since neither of us feel we have to choose between our love life and reaching our potential.\n\nSo what\u2019s the issue? There has been one primary wedge growing between us this whole time: Her parents\u2019 extremely religious, insular, and conservative culture. My girlfriend and her parents come from a Muslim country, and her parents are practicing Muslims. I know her siblings and many of her friends, but all of these 4 years I have not met her parents. She tells me that if we broke up, she would take the secret to her grave.\n\nHer condition for introducing me to her parents and creating a rift with them is that we are engaged. But as a result of this secret keeping, so many of the stepping stones that I would have wanted in our relationship have been eliminated. Since it\u2019s untenable for her to live with me and keep it secret, we still live in different apartments near our jobs. Weekends with her are also a hot commodity, because she is forced to split them between me, her friends, and staying at her parents\u2019. I\u2019d always imagined that as we grew more serious we\u2019d spend more time together. But that\u2019s been precisely the opposite of the reality the past two years. For some time, she moved in with her family to take care of her father and save on rent. Another reason was that she basically couldn\u2019t come up with a convincing reason for them why she was living on her own during the pandemic.\n\nI understood, but this time period with her parents especially made me feel like trash. I was still recovering from my own surgery and doing PT. During this time, she couldn\u2019t stay the night and always had an excuse for them. So she\u2019d come for a rushed 6-8 hours, wearing hiking clothes or whatever other costume she needed to pass off her latest excuse of \u201chiking with friends\u201d or a \u201cday on the beach\u201d or whatever. During this time, I signed a new lease, and really only remained in the state for her. My family is in another state and my job didn\u2019t require me to be anywhere in particular. She eventually moved out but this has still been difficult for me to move past.\n\nDuring all this, we started doing couple\u2019s counseling. In many regards it helped a lot. I\u2019ve been convinced I want to settle down and have kids with her for some time, and it really pushed us to examine what that means. For example, I realized I\u2019m fine with her giving the kids Muslim names and raising them to understand her religion. This is important to her since she fears losing her culture in mine.\n\nAnyway, we got all the way to talking about the logistics of engagement, and that\u2019s when I started to get cold feet. I think I feel like it\u2019s been such an exhausting  fight to be introduced to her friends and family. I\u2019m an extrovert who likes to fill my life with people, but I\u2019ve been getting lonely as I get older and would really like my relationship to be a rock that I can come home to. Additionally, with our limited time together taken up by this more than it used to be, our relationship has gone through a phase of being kind of cooled. It feels like we have less fun and sex than we used to. A final piece on top of all this is that she is applying for her PhD this cycle. I\u2019m very excited for her, but if I follow her this could mean uprooting my own life: Finding another job, making new social circles, etc.\n\nI told her all this recently. More specifically, I told her that I felt in many ways recently we have been at a low. I want to fix it, but I feel that an engagement is not the way to do so. In my mind, an engagement should be the celebration and commitment to a relationship that is doing capital g Great right now. It should not be a means to an end. \n\nNevertheless, I feel like we\u2019re at an impasse. I think many of our problems would resolve if we just spent more time together. Every time we spend a weekend together, my doubts disappear and I know it can work. Then these confident feelings gradually melt away during the weeks of separation from her. But spending more time together would require her to stop compartmentalizing all the different portions of her life. I wish she would tell her parents simply because she wants to take a stand for her lifestyle; not as a sacrifice on my behalf. But asking her to do this has never really been an option.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. The relationship is too good to walk away from, but it\u2019s so fucked up to solve these problems by leaping in with a ring. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it.\n\nIf you got this far, thank you for reading, and double thank you for any advice.\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m in a bit of a Catch-22. Girlfriend doesn\u2019t want to tell her conservative parents about our relationship until we\u2019re engaged.

I was never interested in more with her as I disliked her character and she neither. She was a lot closer to many other guys in our class).\n\nOur old guys friend group (with who I hang out regularly) had invited Tamara again last year but I didn't go because of the jealousy of my gf. Was pretty hard to explain them the reason and nobody understood (especially her lol). \n\nWhen something bothers my gf or she feels insecure she goes into a \"no feeling\" state a couple of hours or days where she doesnt say a word, stays in bed all the time and doesn't react to me or the surrounding at all, just a stare in the void or sometimes crying but thats not frequent. \n\nWhat doesnt help is that she has 0 friends and as staying at home alone is very difficult for her, I take her to every night I spend with my friend groups. That went somewhat ok for the last 2 year (no need to elaborate more on this post about that).\n\nComing to this weekend, I really want to go but I see only the following options\n* I go with my gf without telling her that Tamara could be there too, but if she shows up, I am almost certain that she would go into no feeling mood and we'd have to go home immediately as I dont feel well leaving my gf in this state and I'm tired of trying to justify her behaviour to my friends.\n* I tell her about it now but then I'm sure that she wouldn't want to go anymore.\n* If she doesnt want to go because of that, she would surely say \"but you can go\" hoping kind of expecting that I wont but I really would want but \n1 I would not be able to enjoy there if I know that my gf is at home alone suffering in great fear of the fictional scenarios she creates in her head (I was there with my ex and know how awful it feels)\n2 I dont trust her to not hurt herself. I'm almost certain that she would at least cut herself and that just makes me sick and kind of eliminates this possibility.\nOn the other hand, I cant be a life long slave of my fear that she would hurt herself and as my psy said, I should do what I want to do (while respecting and reassuring her as I can) because I need to live my life to be able to stay with her.\n* I dont go at all like all the other times where they celebrated new year without me because she didnt want to go and it was a nogo that I go alone or when they did vacation without me or the time they go to a festival etc. \nThat would make me and all my friends unhappy as they expect me there. \n* I ask him to tell her to not come. Would be kind of unfair to her and everyone else and I dont have the balls to ask him something stupid like this. I did explain him my situation with her though we'll see how he reacts to that\n\nAs you can see, it appears to me that I'm in an impossible situation where I can't make everyone happy like I usually try hard. I need an external view and advice.

Recent sex drought has been 3 weeks and ongoing. Girlfriend blueballed me even after finally initiating and playing with me. I reacted poorly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been dating for almost a year. It has been a reoccurring theme the past 6 months when there is a sex drought because she has no desire to have sex. When these occur it impacts me because I feel undesired and unloved. When it gets bad, we communicate about it and every time the conclusion is something along the lines of me needing to improve the relationship on my end and better satisfy her needs (which is totally valid, but at this point I feel that putting initiative and work in bettering the relationship is very one sided). Things such as her desiring sex with me less because I dont take her out on dates enough, I am not dominant enough, me having a terrible sleep schedule so it impacts her day negatively, etc. Every time I communicated me feeling unloved because of her little interest in our sex life the conclusion is me needing to work on one of those. I do work on those after we communicate, however, a lot of times it seems her sex drive diminishes even after I put that effort which in terms makes me lose the desire to better satisfy her needs to make her feel loved. The one time I told her I feel she does not put enough effort into our relationship and my needs she replies by saying that she cant make herself desire sex (I still think she can put effort into our sex life but she makes it seem that effort requires her to pressure herself to have sex).  \n\n\nAnyways, back to what occurred today. The most recent and ongoing sex drought has been around 3 weeks with her not desiring sex at all. A week ago we had our most recent discussion about it which basically is the last part of the first paragraph. Typically before she goes to bed, I cuddle her to sleep (I get up when she falls asleep because  I have a later sleep schedule). She usually browses her phone and gives me little attention or intimacy until she is ready for bed and then wants to cuddle while she is trying to fall asleep. The usual routine happened tonight as well, however, she finally decided to want to increase sexual tension and initiate (doesnt happen often) by rubbing my stomach and then a minute later slowly playing me with. When there is sexual tension I always usually start foreplaying with her as well however she is on her period and it was clear she wasnt wanting that. After around a minute of playing with me, she stops suddenly saying that she was tired. I then tell her that she made me really horny and she replied by saying she needed sleep. This really frustrated me because she knows that I feel really sexually neglected, especially the past month because of our sex drought, she knows how it emotionally impacts me because of our conversations. All of this build up combined with what just occurred made me mad. She then wanted to continue cuddling and then she asked me to play with her hair (I usually do that because it helps her sleep). I said no I dont want to. She then replied by saying that she felt that I dont like her anymore. I said that makes no sense. After that conversation she just little spooned and tried to fall asleep. At this point I wasnt having it so I moved her aside while saying I had to use the bathroom. She then in a somewhat mad tone said the only reason why I am going to the bathroom is to jerk off. I replied saying \"It doesnt matter, its not like you care anyways.\" This made her really mad and she turned around and pretended to sleep.   \n\n\nWhat is going thru her mind?

It made me feel nice and happy to know he was thinking of that, I have accomplished quite a lot while he\u2019s been gone, and I feel happy with where I\u2019m at &amp; the path I\u2019m going, and I know he\u2019s the person my heart will always want so it felt nice reading that.

We took it slow and only recently moved in together because I didn't want to go through the same issues that I had in my last two long term relationships and we both have kids. I was completely honest with him about my mental and physical health, my bad habits, everything I expected in a partner, and all that I was going through to better myself. I didn't want him to be surprised if he chose to stay with me. We seemed to really click. We seemed to feel and think the same way about relationships. He was good with kids.

As soon as we moved in together, he stopped doing almost anything with household chores, and blames me or the kids for the mess or not reminding him to take out the trash. It's always someone else's fault. He started teasing me about my weight and what I eat. I'm a bit squishy, and I like some unhealthy snacks, but I really don't indulge as much as he accuses me of.  I'm still only about 15-20lbs past my goal weight, and only 10 lbs more than when he met me. He talks crap about my parenting, my housekeeping skills, my bathing habits, my depression and anxiety, even the TV shows I like to watch. It feels like he completely lied to me about everything until we moved in together, and now he is using me because I am stuck in a situation that is difficult to get out of.

It really went well and i was superhappy.\n\nI told Tom a few days later about something awful Max did (I had a panic attack which is why I told him). In fact one of Max\u2019s friends harrased me in a sexual way and Max took his friend\u2019s side.\n\nTom was upset about this, especially because I always told him how repsectful and feminist Max was. He told me I could keep my friendship with Max but he no longer wanted to take part in it and see Max.\n\nI agreed except a week later I had an emergency and I told Tom \u2018I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m calling Max\u2019. This obviouslh hurt him.\n\nThere were some other incidents such as me still having lots of pictures of Max and I on social media, his picture being at my mom\u2019s place, or that I had a box with pictures of Max and I and Tom found them while moving.\n\nI few weeks ago Tom bought something at the shop Max works (he didn\u2019t know) and Max forwarded me the receipt and added some things for free. I could see Tom was surprised by this.\n\nMore recently Tom discovered Max is still part of FB groups of my friends and I and I can feel that he feels bad.\n\nTom and I talked about things, also because I told anecdotes about a FWB I had, and Tom told me that he really didn\u2019t want any details about my past with other people.

When it was my turn I refused at first but decided to tell two anecdotes I thought he knew about some random hookups I had.\n\nIn the car he told me How this Made him feel insecure and how we talked about these things. I started to yell, he screamed back and Basically according to him he is tired of me pushing my ex\u2019s and FWB\u2019s in his face.

I'm always the one that does the traveling and he is the one that usually buys my ticket to see him.  He has never come to see me in the USA and said he likely never will. He also wants me to eventually move away and leave my family and life behind here to live on a farm with him out in the countryside. I'm a city girl that loves shopping so it's not exactly easy for me PLUS i'm very close with my family. I should also mention i'm a Christian and he is an atheist so that doesn't always jive well but we tend to respect each other having their own beliefs and it usually isn't of concern. His family is against us and he needs to be on the farm to help his dad with Parkinsons disease and help take care of the farm work. I understand in order for our relationship to work sacrifices are necessary and i'm okay with that. And even though he is expecting me to make some major adjustments to my life because i'm very attracted to him and because I love him i'm willing to do so.  EXCEPT NOW he is telling me that he decided he doesn't want to work at a job anymore and just wants to go to college to get a better job than one where he would have to do physical labor since he has a bad shoulder and since he is 6'4 and strong build every job he get accepted to wants him to do heavy lifting.  The only problem is.....if he doesn't have a job he can't help buy my tickets to see him, nor can we apply for a resident permit if he doesn't have a job.   And I literally can't have a proper job here in the states since i'm the one that goes to visit him every 3 - 4 months so my only work is stuff I do online which doesn't pay well.  So I feel like now he is expecting me to have to pay for everything too.  And it makes me feel like he isn't even trying to hold his end in this relationship. Like he has given up on me almost and is basically telling me that if I still want to be with him I have to do all the work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL; DR   \nMy long distance boyfriend doesn't want to work anymore and will be unable to buy my tickets to go see him and I won't be able to get a resident permit to live with him.

We have had a loving relationship aside from breaking up once early on because I felt he wasn\u2019t as invested in me as I was in him. We got back together 3 weeks later and our relationship was much better afterward and has continually grown stronger.\n\nWe now live together. We love each other. We talk about getting married and having kids. He plans to propose soon.\n\nRecently we went to a wedding. The next day he causally asked me if I knew one of his girl friends and him had oral sex before we started dating. I did not know, duh. It hurt me as I have been to many parties and hang outs with her and even spent time with her one on one meanwhile through all 5 years of dating I didn\u2019t know this history existed.\n\nI asked if there was anything else I needed to know. He tells me a more distant girl friend gave him a hand job once before dating me. I asked, anything else? He said \u201cnothing I swear.\u201d Are you sure? \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nI asked why he was telling me now and he said that he didn\u2019t want to exchange vows and have people in the audience know things I didn\u2019t.\n\nI forgive him. The next day he is sick to his stomach - I assume it\u2019s unrelated. At the end of the day he tells me there\u2019s more. Before we broke up way back when a girl came onto him at a party and rubbed his dick through his pants. After a bit (?) he told her he had a gf and she stopped. He felt extremely guilty.\n\nI mad and sad. He told me that there was nothing else and then this comes up. He\u2019s apologizing \u201cI feel so shitty for lying. There\u2019s nothing else. I swear\u201d\n\nI decide to level with him and confess to sleeping next to and cuddling a guy in my sleep once at a party in those early days. So then he says \u201cI once asked *oral sex* girl for nudes on Snapchat when I was really drunk but she said no\u201d this was maybe a year or 2 in - he couldn\u2019t recall.\n\nI tell him that\u2019s the worst one yet. I\u2019m heartbroken. He thought it wasn\u2019t as big of a deal because nothing happened. I say it was the intent and I want to break up.\n\nHe absolutely devastated having an emotional and physical reaction. Says he knows I deserve better. He wants to marry me etc. Swears on his mom and dogs life that he has nothing more to confess.\n\nWhat do I do? I still love him. All of this was so long ago - people change. If I knew then I probably would have broke up with him. But the man I know today is a good man. Yet he broke my trust. On multiple occasions.

And I know this is totally wrong for me to do but I ended up snooping through my boyfriends phone. At that time I didn\u2019t know what Reddit was so when I would come across it I wouldn\u2019t l even bother checking it. I would get on his Facebook and see if he would look up any girl or exes of his. I did ended up finding a girl on his search bar on messenger once but he said that he was trying to block her because she would appear on his Facebook feed and didn\u2019t even know who she was. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt and we moved on from it. \n\nEver since I started using tiktok I would see girls say that to look up on Reddit to see if our bfs look up naked girls or porn because somehow Reddit has porn. So one night I got into his phone while he was asleep and I immediately got into his Reddit app. I\u2019ve never used Reddit but I did know where the history and saved buttons were. I went to his history and I ended up seeing naked girls with dildos up their asses and clips of girls showing their boobs. My heart sank.. like it sanked. I couldn\u2019t believe my bf actually searching and looking at other naked women when he\u2019s with me.. \n\nI couldn\u2019t wait till the morning so I woke up my boyfriend up and confronted him about it. I asked him when would he look up those girls and he said what I would be sleeping or gone. I cried so much that night I was ready to leave the relationship. Now don\u2019t get me wrong. My boyfriend (m25) is the sweetest man I\u2019ve ever been with. Our sex is off the roof and our love life is great. He always reminds me how beautiful I am and how much he loves me. But then I wonder why would he look up naked girls? Not only did we have a fight about it once but after I told him to please stop he did it again.. \n\nThe second fight he begged for me not to leave him and truthfully I didn\u2019t want to leave him either. I love him too much. But now I\u2019m left with all these insecurities and the feeling of not being good enough for him.
