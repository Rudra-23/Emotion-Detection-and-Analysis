cause seizures or strokes. \n\new why am i even saying this\n\nnone of u are dumb enough to do this\n\nmeh\n\nmy plan is to do 375 tomorrow, see what it's like, and if it goes well, i'll do 425 (the

You can ask us about anything and the tutors will try to answer your questions as far as possible.\n\nIf you are older than 16 and want to try your hand at teaching you can pm me too :D.

It was an ok day, my family ate a nice dinner and I got some presents. So, all in all, it was good. But turning eighteen, If I am being honest, I don\u2019t like it.  \nI don\u2019t know if this is the best subreddit to write this in, but hey, I\u2019m a teenager so why not give it a shot? Turning eighteen, it\u2019s scary. Truth is, I have been looking forward to it like I look forward to everything else that will inevitably come. I was even a bit happy about turning eighteen until I realized what it entailed. Turning eighteen, I get to drive a car by myself, get to be more independent from my parents and get to do stuff that r/teenagers won\u2019t allow me to specify. All of these are good things according to society, right? (God that sounded cringy). Turning eighteen, it does mean you become more independent. You have to become more independent, you can\u2019t rely on mommy and daddy taking care of you and taking care of your problems.  \nTurning eighteen means I will soon have to learn how to pay taxes, I will have to learn how to live by myself, I will have to learn by myself how to fix problems when they arise without a guiding voice telling me what to do, I will have to do a lot of things in the future. I can\u2019t just go home from school every day and talk to friends and play games all day. I have to worry about life and things like that.  \nI don\u2019t really want to be an adult. I was completely fine being a little kid. But I will have to eventually move out, I will eventually have to start making financial decisions on my own, I will eventually live on my own. Society will be expecting me to start producing, be that financially or family-wise. It will be expecting me to give it something, and I\u2019m not sure I am ready for it. I have kept my grades up so I can continue studying, because that is all I really know, how to be academic. So I want to go to a university or college where I can continue with what I know, but even then I will probably have to move out to that place, meet new people and lose contact with the friends I used to have. And then when university or college is over, then I will have to meet life head-on anyway.  \nBut a part that is also a bit scary is that people often say that when you get older you drift away from your friends and it is harder to make new friends. But I am already bad at making new friends and I often lose them the minute I don\u2019t have a guaranteed chance of meeting them again. Eighteen years have just flown by, without stopping to wait and see if I am ready to enter a world that is harsh and cruel, but at the same time beautiful and amazing.  \nTurning eighteen is scary, it makes me anxious every day. Yet I have to find a way to move through with it. Turning eighteen means the end of childhood, I can never go back. Turning eighteen means I am no longer seventeen (what no you don\u2019t mean that?). Turning eighteen means I have to start acting like an adult, and have to start trying to be an adult. Turning eighteen means the end of teenager me and the start of adult me, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to let go. Turning eighteen means nothing and everything, an arbitrary fact that I have survived on this blue planet for about 6,600 days (not gonna say specifically how many days for reasons), now I have to figure out how to survive the next 6,600 days. Turning eighteen means I have missed out on so much, and I have experienced so much. \n\nAnyways thanks for reading this, If you did. Leave a comment if you want, then forget about this the next day.

In the end it all leaves me wondering why people care about anything on a small scale, I heard a kid get in a strangely heated argument with his mother simply because she didn't want him spending the night at a friends house... it's almost funny I guess, that something so seemingly small can be the source of such an argument.\n\n         Jesus, everyday feels like a round in the ring with Jack Dempsey... I just want a sense of normalcy, I guess that's why I put up with the pit of Tartarus known as school. \"Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle\"- Ian Maclaren. It's such a simple principle, yet the majority of my so-called \u201cpeers\u201d don't seem to understand it in the slightest. they sit around and gossip all day, laughing at people for things they can't control, and if they aren't making fun of people behind their backs they\u2019re doing it to their faces, drawing out the insecurities of people who mean no harm to the people around them. The worst part of it is that the majority of the \"bullies\" don't even know how harmful their words can be, they think they're just joking around, being playful, and then when someone decides to end their own suffering in this world, they give their regards and show sympathy, not even knowing that they themselves are a part of what led to the decision.\n\n         And don't even get me started on community bigotry, yeah in many places over the past decade bigotry has become a lot less prominent, but it's still present. The day I came out as bisexual(though I later learned I was gay) someone came up and told me that I was living in sin. I was living in sin because I loved who I loved and I refused to try fruitlessly to change who I was because the people around me decided that their religion dislikes gays more than the other non consequential \u201csins'' such as eating bacon, or wearing wool and linen at the same time. The anger that makes me feel is tremendous, and I can't stand for it. Yet, despite all my anger I can\u2019t do anything about my situation, or more importantly the situations of the other down-trodden youth of this screwed up world\u2026 all because I\u2019m just a kid. Being a teenager is, to put it simply, one of the most frustrating things in the world. Old enough to realise the world around you is going in the gutter, yet too young to do anything about it. Teenagers can\u2019t elect representatives, they can\u2019t vote, and quite honestly very few people even give them enough respect to actually listen. Being helpless is bad, but knowing you\u2019re helpless is so much worse. \n\n         But, ever the optimist (you hear the sarcasm?), I must end on a high note.\n\n         Unlike what it may seem, every interaction you have with another human being is a chance to make the world a slightly better place. Be kind, ask how people are doing, take a minute out of your day to care for another person, because they just may do the same for another. And maybe when you get through with school, you'll be able to do something a bit more substantial.\n\n\n         Signing off- Me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "title": "Below is a rant about my dissatisfaction with the state of being a teenager... be warned, I am a very opinionated individual, as such my opinions may very well leak into my writing."}, {"created_utc": 1613702151, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ln4fyv/holy_shiet_i_hate_texas/", "num_comments": 31, "score": 1, "selftext": "-15 degrees wtf", "title": "holy shiet i hate texas"}, {"created_utc": 1613702101, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ln4fdq/i_just_learned_something_about_hackers_today_that/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "I just learned something about hackers today that you should probably keep in mind"}, {"created_utc": 1613702068, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ln4ey9/yo_guys_ask_me_stuff_i_give_award/", "num_comments": 24, "score": 1, "selftext": "Filler filler filler Filler filler filler Filler filler filler", "title": "Yo guys ask me stuff I give award"}, {"created_utc": 1613702062, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ln4ew2/filler_with_some_filler_with_a_side_of_filler/", "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "Lana\n\nLana \n\nLANAAAAAA", "title": "Filler with some filler with a side of filler"}, {"created_utc": 1613702053, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ln4esc/i_made_another_edm_song/", "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "selftext": "It's not amazing but here it is if you wanna check it out [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvaU837yVp0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvaU837yVp0)\n\nWith that being said, if you liked what you saw please like, comment, and subscribe, dislike if you disliked it, and I... am... out.", "title": "I made another EDM song"}, {"created_utc": 1613702049, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ln4eqg/how_do_boys_do_their_hair_like_this_and_know_how/", "num_comments": 10, "score": 1, "selftext": "https://i.imgur.com/cGK3Y0l.jpg", "title": "How do boys do their hair like this and know how to be so cute like that"}, {"created_utc": 1613702017, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ln4ecb/fuck_the_backrooms/", "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "selftext": "All my homies live in the drainage pipes.", "title": "Fuck the backrooms"}, {"created_utc": 1613702003, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ln4e6w/_/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "title": "#"}, {"created_utc": 1613701994, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ln4e3g/most_upvoted_joke_in_the_comments_gets_a_free/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Most upvoted joke in the comments gets a free award.

Someone who could just.. understand you \n\nTo go on a trip with to the beach, get ice cream and just talk. Watch the sunset. Be weird with, run into the water with your clothes on because you just want to have fun. That\u2019s it. No judgement. No mean looks.

The next day he gets me my own account for the beta version and I build a crazy castle and other buildings on and play on for at least 5 years through so many updates that the chunks are bugged to hell.

One night we\u2019re watching tv and the power goes out so my mom and sister go to sleep and me and my dad stay up and talk. He bring out his phone and plays some of his favorite songs from bands like Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Pantera, and Metallic. We spent all night in silence rocking out in the dark.\n\nHobbies: I like doing physical stuff and working out despite my dads inability to operate his limbs effectively. However we did used to go down to our barn and lift for hours on end when he could and he could easily lift 200lbs and rep it so I aspire to be there. On top of that my dad got me into computers and taught be how to build and do stuff with them. A couple years ago I had enough money to build my own gaming pc and my dad was there the whole way for all 5 hours it took to put it together still jamming out to our favorite songs.\n\nThese are just a few great moments with my dad and I definitely have more if you have a topic.", "title": "Memories with dad (add your own in comments)"}, {"created_utc": 1638930927, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/rbge62/two_girls_laughed_at_me_in_gym_today/", "num_comments": 14, "score": 3, "selftext": "[deleted]", "title": "Two girls laughed at me in gym today"}, {"created_utc": 1638930903, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/rbgdw1/why_do_i_keep_going_when_i_know_everything_is/", "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "title": "Why do I keep going when I know everything is going to fall apart again?"}, {"created_utc": 1638930887, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/rbgdow/made_this_ornament_for_my_pc_loving_bf_out_of_an/", "num_comments": 8, "score": 13, "selftext": "", "title": "Made this ornament for my PC loving bf out of an old PCI board.

What I really want to talk about is how a lot of people try to make idiots out of teens who can't know what sex is. There's people who say the age of consent should be higher and they're not some kind of boomers or anything they're mostly around 20 themselves. I understand why underage people posting pictures of themselves is bad but I don't understand why if a 16 year old person posts anything related to sex they get a ton of people telling them how bad they are because they're underage and aren't supposed to think about such things. Do they really want for young people like us to not know or think about sex before we're 21? It's natural that we while going through puberty are horny as fuck and you can't hide it.

I hope these help you. \n\n1. Friends/Relationships \nFriends will come and go, and as you graduate middle/high school, you will probably lose a lot of friends. You\u2019ll also make more. Don\u2019t worry about being in a certain friend group or circle. If they\u2019re really your friends, you\u2019ll feel included. If you feel like your \u201cfriends\u201d are ignoring you, screwing with you, or using you, they\u2019re not your friends, and they\u2019re probably just not saying you aren\u2019t their friend out of politeness. Don\u2019t waste your time with people that don\u2019t want you. Don\u2019t be afraid to take a risk with someone you like, your youth goes by faster than you think and many of the things you can do now you won\u2019t be able to later. \n\n2. Jobs for young people\nIf you are fortunate enough to grow up in a financially secure family, pick the fun job every time. You\u2019ll be making money for something you can enjoy, even if it pays less. Having a job with friends makes it all the better. If you want money, get a job where you can be paid in tips. You will make much more money than anywhere else you can find. SAVE ALL THE MONEY YOU CAN. Don\u2019t go blow your paycheck on clothes, doordash, and other expensive things as soon as you get the check. You are starting a horrible cycle than many adults have a hard time getting out of. You\u2019ll be thankful later, and if you save well, Ill bet most of you can save up around $10-15k if you start working when highschool starts to the time it ends. \n\n3. Investing\nMost of you can\u2019t open a brokerage account because you aren\u2019t old enough. There are brokerage accounts called custodial accounts, which have joint ownership between you and your parents, which will allow you to buy and sell stocks. If you don\u2019t know anything about the stock market, I would recommend buying an ETF called the SPY. This ETF is always worth 1/10 of the S&amp;P 500. Don\u2019t be afraid if you buy this and a couple hours later you check and see you\u2019ve already lost a few bucks. In the long run, this has always gone up. As long as you buy the SPY down 2-3% of the all time high, you will probably make money within around a month or less. DONT PANIC SELL, AND DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN YOURE COMFORTABLE LOSING, AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY ANYTHING. As you get older, you\u2019ll learn more and more about the stock market, and you may even be able to add a significant amount of money onto your salary. \n\n4. Drugs/alcohol\nWhen you get into highschool (and some of you even in middleschool) you will probably be exposed to drugs at some point. If you can stay away from these. If you really, really, want to try them, be VERY careful about what you take. Always use in moderation, be aware of the side affects, which includes your mental health, not just physically. Don\u2019t do any pills, any hard drugs, and anything that you\u2019ve seen a homeless person doing. I can\u2019t stress enough that these will screw your life up. Be aware that if you do these your school and the law may be very hard on you about it, and getting caught can really screw up your chances of college and landing a decent job in the future if you have a criminal record. \n\n5. College\nMost schools will gear your education around preparing you for college. It\u2019s not for everybody, and if you choose not to go, make sure you have a plan for after you graduate. Don\u2019t be afraid of community college and trade school. These might be much better for your situation, especially financially. Community college is much cheaper, and if you can\u2019t afford a big university, this is might be your best option. You might not have as much fun at community or trade school, but your future is most important. Being financially secure will make your life so, so much easier in the long run. Don\u2019t waste your money and time paying for a degree, especially if you go to a big university you can\u2019t afford.

Looking to breathe like a pro? Well take my advice and you'll be breathing like a champion.\n\n1) Breathe through your nose \n\nThis small adjustment can greatly affect how much oxygen you intake with each breathe. Breathing in through your nose is way more efficient than breathing through your mouth. It can also help to calm you and focus your mind faster.\n\n2) Breathe with your belly\n\nPut you hand on your belly and breathe normally. Your belly should expand, this indicates that you are making the most of your diaphragm and breathing efficiently. If this is not the case you are likely breathing with your lungs, breathe consciously for a moment and start breathing with your belly. Due to the positions we are put in in the modern world, people gradually tend to start breathing with their chest instead of their belly. Observe your pet if you have one and notice that when they breathe their entire belly will expand outwards. \n\n3) Take deeper breaths \n\nInstead of taking short, fast breaths, take deeper longer ones. This will calm your mood and help you if you're feeling angry or emotional in some way. Control of your breathing will allow you to control your emotions and.\n\nSo yeah, 3 tips for breathing. I'd recommend taking some time out of your day to practise your breathing.

For the longest time our relationship was entirely platonic other than a bit of flirting here and there but we where always just good friends. Over time the chemistry started to develop more but we remained just friends.\n\nEventually the restaurant ran out of buisness and the owner was forced to sell out. The majority of the team quit including me and her. Not long after she invites me over to her house when her dad is gone and we end up hooking up. It was super passionate and I could tell she wanted to do this for a long time but she also wanted to take it slow.\n\n\nThe problem is she was just a side chick to me at the time and I was pursuing a serious relationship with this 19 year old. \n\nHere\u2019s when shit falls apart..\n\nI\u2019m not going to sugercoat it but I was involved with a robbery against her older brother, it wasn\u2019t me directly but i set it up and they know that\n\nAlso started posting pictures of that other girl.\n\nNot sure which one she was mad at but she texted me something along the lines of \u201c how fucking stupid do you think I am?\u201d \nAnd I kind of just said I can\u2019t love a hoe and blocked her.\n\nHonestly forgot about her for a long time and never really thought much of it until now. I think it really hurt her because I remember as soon as I unblocked her on my socials I could see her viewing my posts even though she didn\u2019t even follow me. \n\nWhenever I saw her in school she would look so sad and completely avoid me. Haven\u2019t had any contact with her since that last message.\n\nI now realize that this was really mean and we where really good friends and I feel pretty bad about it. Her bio on insta is \u201cuse things not people\u201d and I deadass think that\u2019s about me. I know it\u2019s been a while but at the time I was the only dude she\u2019s been with and we didn\u2019t do much.\n\nShe was a really chill friend and I moved away for school and noticed she is in a city close to me.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time do you guys think she will forgive me if I hit her up?", "title": "Should I hit her up again?

You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as an insult by edgy twelve year olds. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sac religious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. We might as well never have formed the phantom thieves, because surely not any amount of rotten adults would be able to affect the world as negatively as you just did. The only reason I am not reporting you to the police as we speak is that I know for a fact that their weak, pathetic prisons will never be able to hold such an indescribable evil. No wonder your dad beat you when you were little, it turns out he was trying to guard the world from the colossal mistake he had created. Kamoshida had every right to break your leg, because he was only trying to immobilize the incredible failure that is you so that your terrible mistakes may not spread to innocent foreign countries all over the world. He has not succeeded though, because your indescribable failure was on such an incredibly ginormous scale, that not even the possible life forms at the edge of the universe could have been guarded from it. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. I may not be a human, but I will forever have more humanity than you, for you are truly a wretched, horrible, filthy, evil monster because of what you just did. No wonder society rejected you: you were eventually going to break it beyond recognition. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. The phantom thieves and the world would have been so much better of if you had never joined us. You say you want to help the world but then you destroy everything everyone has ever worked for to such an extreme extent immediately when you have the chance? You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. We could just have you replace Satanael, except even Satan is not that evil, and because of his high stats he at least lands a fucking attack! Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if there was a god, he would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror movies made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the viewer has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. In the future, YouTube videos will get demonetized for making a sound that even resembles your name, and social media posts will get flagged and taken down for daring to speak about a topic like you. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The nations of this world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world and the Milky Way, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who\u2019s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in. But than again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure a living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words nor my time. Just know that I will forever detest you for your failure and everything you stand for, and that no matter what happens, I will never ever forgive you.\u201d", "title": "i found this comment here, i cant find the person who made it"}, {"created_utc": 1621583220, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/nhmygl/the_two_ongoing_anime_i_am_watching_this_season/", "num_comments": 11, "score": 1, "selftext": "Zombieland Saga Revenge (9/10)\n\nGodzilla: Singular Point (7.5/10)\n\nWhat are some ongoing anime you're watching and how would you rate them currently?", "title": "The two ongoing anime I am watching this season."}, {"created_utc": 1621583206, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/nhmycf/people_sharing_photos_of_their_setups_and_rooms/", "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "selftext": "Me who study in the ground", "title": "People sharing photos of their setups and rooms"}, {"created_utc": 1621583157, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/nhmxys/me_telling_the_truth_to_a_bunch_of_strangers/", "num_comments": 14, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm suicidal and self harm.. it's not because I don't think my parents don't love me.

I've started having cryptic thoughts at night. One afternoon the power went out because of a fire, caused by a gazebo hitting a power line. The fire never spread more than a few feet because everyone  put it upon themselves to pull the weeds out of the alley, which is placed behind my backyard. Tonight in bed my brain wandered to that memory, and I wondered to myself, what would've happened if no one picked the weeds? I imagined the fire spreading to our house, burning it down, leaving our family homeless. I was taught the law of attraction at a young age and have always been a firm believer of it, so upon seeing these images I immediately shut them down and I'm starting to realize I seriously need therapy. I've been having these thoughts way too often. There are many different ones I could list.\n\n       2. I have trouble keeping my cool. I am rather spoiled when it comes to gaming, I have a $3000 gaming computer setup, an Xbox One (fuck scalpers im not buying a series x), a Nintendo switch, a phone which i am using rn to type this, and an Oculus Quest 2. Sometimes I play with one of my cousins on super smash bros. Ultimate. He has almost 1500 hours on the whole franchise, while I only have played 400 hours of one game, ultimate. Obviously there is a skill gap, but every time I improve substantially and start thinking i can compete with him, I end up going from losing 7/10 matches to winning half of them. When I start thinking im gonna outclass him, he just turns up the difficulty a little bit and now I'm losing 8/10 matches. This loop has happened like 10 times  now, and every time it happens, i just start to have less fun with the game. For comparison, when he's on a good day, going maximum super saiyan, he took out 4 lvl 50 amiibos who were trained a substantial amount against him. For those who don't know, that's like beating the Moon Lord with a copper shortsword, like beating the Ender Dragon with no armor and unenchanted weapons, like getting the \"My Kung Fu is Stronger\" achievement. I also only play smash bros. with said cousin so that could also have something to do with it.\n\n\n       3. I'm not in contact with ANY friends. The one person I could ever call my best friend who I've known since the beginning of time. I haven't seen him since covid became a thing. I know I will see his face again someday, its just... ugh. I'm starting high school which could be the perfect time to make some new friends, I have high hopes for that. I had a couple friends but since school ended we haven't talked at all. I've had no human interaction except family, my cousins, and online.\n\n\nTL;DR: I have one friend who i haven't seen for a year, I play too many video games, I can't keep my cool, and I can't stop having evil thoughts.\n\nIt feels like my mental state can only go up from here.
